For the Onion:                                                                        See how to slice a Bloomin' OnionCombine all of the dip ingredients in a bowl, cover and refrigerate.Slice the onion (see below). Whisk the flour, cayenne, paprika, thyme, oregano, cumin and 1/2  teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. In a small deep bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and 1 cup water.Place the onion in a separate bowl, cut-side up, and pour all of the flour mixture on top. Cover the bowl with a plate, then shake back and forth to distribute the flour. Check to make sure the onion is fully coated, especially between the \"petals.\" Lift the onion by the core, turn over and pat off the excess flour; reserve the bowl of flour.Using a slotted spoon, fully submerge the onion in the egg mixture (spoon on top, if necessary). Remove and let the excess egg drip off, then repeat the flouring process. Refrigerate the onion while you heat the oil.Heat the oil in a large deep pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 400 degrees. Pat off excess flour from the onion. Using a wire skimmer, carefully lower the onion into the oil, cut-side down. Adjust the heat so the oil temperature stays close to 350 degrees. Fry about 3 minutes, then turn the onion over and cook until golden, about 3 more minutes; drain on paper towels. Season with salt and serve with the dip.How to Slice a Bloomin' Onion1. Cut off 1/2 inch from the pointy stem end of the onion, then peel.2. Place the onion cut-side down. Starting 1/2 inch from the root, make a downward cut all the way through to the board.3. Repeat to make four evenly spaced cuts around the onion.4. Continue slicing between each section until you have 16 evenly spaced cuts.5. Turn the onion over and use your fingers to gently separate the outer pieces.Photograph by Kate Mathis; Illustration by Brown Bird Design                                                    Recipe

Cover, remove from heat, and allow beans to steep for 1 hour.Meanwhile, pour the sugar into a large, tall pot and shake to spread out in an even layer across the bottom surface. Set over medium-low heat (or just below medium) and let sit until the sugar begins to liquify. This usually takes about 15 minutes, give or take, depending on your stove's heat and the pot used, but watch carefully to avoid burning the sugar. Once the sugar is just starting to liquify, microwave the milk for about 90 seconds, until very warm. Set aside near the stove. As the sugar liquifies, use a heat-safe spatula to gently scoop the melted sugar over the unmelted, just until all of the sugar has melted. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar turns a deep amber color. Remove from heat immediately and carefully pour in milk while stirring. The mixture will be very hot and will bubble up dramatically. Continue to stir until bubbles subside.Set caramel back over heat and stir constantly until any hardened pieces of sugar have melted once again. If a lot of the sugar has hardened, you'll need to stir for a while, but it should all evenly liquify again into a smooth caramel. Once done, set off the heat to cool until just warm. After an hour, stir the coffee-infused cream and, making sure the caramel is no warmer than the cream, strain the cream from the beans into the caramel sauce. Add salt and stir until smooth. Put mixture back on stove briefly over medium heat, stirring just until fairly warm but not hot. Whisk the egg yolks together in a large bowl. While continuing to whisk rapidly, slowly pour in the caramel mixture until all has been added. Transfer mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir, until a custard forms that is just thick enough to lightly coat a wooden spoon, leaving a visible trail when you run your finger down the center. (If you have a good kitchen thermometer , the custard should be at 170\u00ba-175\u00ba when it is ready. Remove custard from heat and strain into a bowl. Set over an ice bath and stir until no longer warm. Stir in vanilla extract. Transfer to a container with the lid slightly ajar and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator (about 8 hours or overnight). Just before churning, whisk ice cream base briefly. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until cold and firm before serving. Serve with homemade caramel sauce   or magic shell   if desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/caramel-latte-ice-cream-608607", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

We are enjoying a warm spell right now and the fresh produce reflects the change of seasons with earthy root vegetables giving way to tender bright greens. I am so happy to have sunshine and bright green asparagus to eat! I recently discovered how delicious asparagus is when served raw, in salads. The trick is to shave it thinly with the sharpest vegetable peeler you have, then dress it with oil, lemon and salt so it wilts, just slightly. Asparagus is like the poster child for Spring.I had eaten quinoa, but never tried cooking it until just recently when I received some samples of it--red, white and black--from Roland Food. Reading about quinoa I discovered while it has the texture of grain, it's actually a fruit. It's also gluten-free. It is very bitter unless thoroughly soaked and rinsed. Fortunately quinoa from Roland Food is already soaked saving me the bother.Quinoa comes from the Andes, a staple in Peru, Chile and Bolivia where it has been cultivated since at least 3,000 BCE. It is high in protein, calcium and iron and the white variety has a sweet flavor. Most importantly, it has all the nine essential amino acids making it a complete protein. I tried toasting the quinoa, but I like the milder sweeter flavor for this recipe. It has a fluffier almost creamy texture that works well with the strong flavor of the leafy arugula. I really like the addition of dill, but you could easily leave it out or use parsley if you prefer. You could also use a slightly different mix of vegetables.Note: If you don't plan on serving this salad right away, reserve the arugula and toss it in the salad right before serving.Quinoa Salad with Arugula, Asparagus and Avocadomakes 2-4 servingsIngredients1/2 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed and drained1 cup water5 asparagus spears, shaved thin (use a vegetable peeler)1 handful fresh baby arugula, roughly chopped1 green onion, chopped2 Tablespoons lemon juice, fresh squeezed2Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil1/2ripe avocado, peeled, pitted and diced2 Tablespoons fresh dill, chopped (optional)Salt and freshly ground pepperInstructionsIn a medium saucepan combine quinoa and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 12- 15 minutes or until liquid is completely absorbed. Meanwhile In a mixing bowl, make the dressing by whisking together lemon juice and oil. Add avocado, green onion and arugula to the dressing.Transfer quinoa to a medium bowl and allow to cool. Add quinoa to dressing and vegetable mixture; toss with fresh dill and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature.Enjoy!Here are just a few interesting quinoa recipes from fellow bloggers:Stuffed Cabbage with Quinoa & Roasted Sweet Potatoes from Karina's KitchenQuinoa Pudding with

"aggregateLikes": 133, "instructions": "In a Dutch oven or large, heavy pot, combine the giblets and water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, skimming off any scum that floats to the surface. Add the cloves, marjoram, and bay leaves and a healthy pinch of salt. You want the broth to be a little undersalted now, as it will cook down over time. Cover, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook for at least 2 hours or up to 3 hours, until the meat starts to fall off the neck and wings.Meanwhile, in a large saut pan, heat the duck fat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, to caramelize it. This will take about 20 minutes or so, and you may need to lower the heat or cover the pan to prevent the onion from burning. Once it is nicely browned, turn off the heat and set aside.Make the dumpling dough while the soup is cooking. Preheat the oven to 400F. Stab each potato all over with the tines of a fork, then rub with the duck fat (this helps them cook). Put the potatoes on a rack in the oven and bake for 1 hour, until when pierced with a knife. Remove them from the oven, break them open to release the steam, and let cool for 15 to 30 minutes.Put the cooked potatoes through a ricer or food mill held over a bowl, or just peel them and mash the potatoes with a fork in the bowl. Add the egg, bread crumbs, salt, nutmeg, and flour and mix just until combined. The dough should be slightly tacky but should still hold together when compressed into a ball. Do not knead the dough like bread dough or the dumplings will be very heavy. Set the dough aside for now.Once the meats are tender, turn off the heat and fish out the gizzards, hearts, necks, and wings. Roughly chop the gizzards and hearts, and pull off all of the meat from the necks and wings. Return all of the meats to the soup. Add the celery, carrot, caramelized onion, raisins, cranberries, and prunes. Turn on the heat again and bring the soup back to a simmer.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the dumplings. Shape the dough into little balls, using about 1 tablespoon dough for each ball. When all of the dumplings have been formed, gently submerge them in the boiling water, which should drop in temperature to a simmer.

"weightWatcherSmartPoints": 44, "aggregateLikes": 135, "instructions": "Cook the bacon in a small dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat until brown, but not yet crispy.  It will release lots of grease.Remove the cooked bacon from the pot and set aside on top of paper towels to absorb excess grease.Pour off all but approximately 1 tablespoon of the grease from the pot and discard.Add onions to the pot with the remaining bacon grease and cook until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add in bourbon, vinegar, water, molasses, and brown sugar, and bring to a boil, scraping down the sides to release browned bits. Add in the chocolate and cooked bacon, and stir to combine.Reduce heat to a low simmer.  Cook for two hours, stirring every 20-30 minutes.  You're halfway done!Use a hand blender or food processor to puree the jam until you reach a smooth texture that still has some bacon bits remaining.  You don't want a puree.Continue to simmer on low heat for another 2 hours, stirring every 20-30 minutes, until jam has reduced to a thicker consistency. When you're done, the jam will resemble a thick, meaty pasta sauce.

then wipe the sides gently with a paper towel. Pulse the whole cookies, including the frosting, in a food processor until fine. Microwave the butter in small microwave safe bowl in 30 second bursts until melted. Pour the cookie crumbs into a medium size bowl and drizzle with the melted butter. Stir until there are no crumbs left. Pour the crumbs into the springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides to create a thick crust.For the FillingPlace the mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine the white chocolate and 5 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and microwave at 50 percent power for 60 to 90 seconds until the chocolate starts to melt. Whisk vigorously until the chocolate is completely smooth, then set aside for 10 to 15 minutes.Prepare the whipped cream by pouring the remaining 1 cups of whipping cream int the chilled mixing bowl. Beat the cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the cream gets bubbly. Slowly add the powdered sugar and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. Set aside.Beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes until its light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Slowly pour in the melted white chocolate and beat on low speed until the chocolate and cream cheese are well combined.Microwave the dulce de leche for about 20 to 30 seconds until it can be easily stirred. Pour the dulce de leche into the cream cheese mixture and beat until all of the ingredients are well mixed to form your mousse. Fold the prepared whipped cream into the mousse until combined. Pour the filling into the prepared piecrust and spread until the top is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours or until the filling is firm.For the ToppingPrepare 1 cup of the whipped cream as described above, using just the whipped cream.

Stir yeast into 1/4 cup warm (105\u00b0\u2013115\u00b0F) water until dissolved. Let stand 10 minutes. 2. Combine flour, wheat germ, and salt in bowl of food processor, stand mixer, or regular bowl. (Reserve 1/3 cup flour if kneading by hand.) 3. Stir butter and honey into 3/4 cup warm water. Stir yeast mixture and butter mixture into flour mixture. (If using food processor, add liquids through feed tube with processor running. If using stand mixer with dough hook, add liquids in steady stream with mixer on low speed.) Follow kneading instructions below.4. Place dough in buttered bowl, and cover. Let rise in warm place 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in volume. 5. Deflate dough, and divide into quarters, then divide each quarter into 4 pieces. Roll dough into balls on floured surface. Place dough balls in 4 rows in greased 9-inch baking pan.6. Cover dough; let rise 45 minutes, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Brush dough with melted butter, and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until tops of rolls are golden and edges are browned. Serve warm. 3 ways to kneadBy Hand Best for cooks who want to \u201cfeel\u201d when dough is ready and desire more control. 1. Combine all but 1/3 cup of flour (reserve this for kneading) with dry ingredients in bowl. Stir in yeast and liquids until a shaggy dough forms. Turn dough onto work surface dusted with reserved flour. Gather the edges of dough into center to make a tight ball, and press with heel of hand several times to remove air from dough. Let dough rest 4 to 5 minutes so it will be less sticky when you knead. 2. Flatten dough ball by pushing down and away from you with the heel of your hand (dough will be an oval-shaped blob). Pull and fold far edge back over dough. Turn dough a quarter turn. Repeat. Kneading can take 2 to 10 minutes. Fully kneaded dough will be smooth and won\u2019t stick to your hands. Stand Mixer (with hook attachment) Best for traditionalists who don\u2019t like to get their hands sticky. This method comes closest to hand kneading without the effort. Place dry ingredients in mixer bowl, and fit mixer with dough hook. Mix on low speed 1 minute to combine. With mixer running at low speed, add yeast and liquids by pouring them down the inside of the bowl. Increase speed to medium-low, and mix 2 minutes. Let dough rest 5 minutes. Mix at medium-low speed 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth. Increase speed to medium, and mix 2 minutes. Kneading is done when dough makes a slapping sound as it hits the side of the bowl. Dough temperature should be close to 90\u00b0F. Food Processor (with regular or dough blade) Best for bakers in a hurry. The blade kneads dough in under 90 seconds. Pulse dry ingredients in food processor fitted with dough blade to combine. With processor running, add yeast and liquids through feed tube. Stop once liquids have been added. Pulse on and off 8 to 10 times until dough comes together in a ball and no dry ingredients remain. Dough temperature will be about 90\u00b0F.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pull-apart-wheat-germ-and-honey-dinner-rolls-758448", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Endless Meal", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Best-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-474130.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 474130, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "The Endless Meal", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00be teaspoons baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00be teaspoons baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup packed brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup butter, at room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups good quality dark chocolate, cut into chunks", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "dark chocolate", "metaInformation": ["dark", "cut into chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19904, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 cups + 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup plain greek yogurt or sour cream (or 2 large eggs)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["plain", "sour", "large", "(or 2 eggs)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea salt", "metaInformation": ["fine"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1012047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Maldon sea salt (or another good quality, mild flavoured sea salt) for sprinkling", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea-salt", "metaInformation": ["for sprinkling", "(or another , mild flavoured sea salt)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 36.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 13.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.theendlessmeal.com/the-best-chocolate-chip-cookies/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 282, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
