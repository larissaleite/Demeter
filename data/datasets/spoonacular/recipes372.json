Place roast in oven and cook for 15 minutes (this will oven sear the roast giving it a nice browned exterior and seal in the juices), then reduce the heat in the oven to 325 degrees and roast to the degree of doneness you desire.  I cooked my roast to med-rare, which is an internal temperature of 135 degrees F.  I used the RoastPerfect app to determine cooking time for that particular doneness.  It said to cook the for 27 minutes once the oven was reduced to 325 degrees F.  That is what I did.  When I checked my instant read thermometer at 27 minutes, it read 135 degrees F.  Take roast out and tent with foil.  Allow it to sit for 10 - 15 minutes before carving.  While roast is resting, make the Creamy Horseradish Sauce by combining all the ingredients.  Serve alongside the carved roast.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/garlic-herb-beef-tenderloin-roast-with-creamy-horseradish-sauce-693805", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 292, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cheesy-Garlic-Bread-446267.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 446267, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Cheesy Garlic Bread", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 45.58, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "dried oregano", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2027, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 loaf (1 pound) French bread, halved lengthwise", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "french bread", "metaInformation": ["halved lengthwise"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crusty-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18029, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "4 garlic cloves, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 21.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cheesy-garlic-bread-2", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a small bowl, combine the butter, garlic and oregano; spread on cut sides of bread.

Place ramekins into the oven and bake for 45-60 minutes or until bread pudding is set, golden brown on top and no longer wobbly inside.5. While the bread pudding is baking, prepare the dreamy custard sauce. In a medium saucepan, stir together milk and salt. Bring mixture to a boil while stirring very frequently. In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until light and pale, about 2 minutes. Once milk has come to a boil, reduce heat to low and pour 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the beaten egg mixture while whisking constantly. Once combined, pour egg mixture into the remaining milk in the saucepan - whisking vigorously as well. Continue to whisk mixture while it cooks over low heat until it begins to thicken, about 3-4 minutes. Make sure your heat is in low. Too high and your eggs will start to curdle. Pour custard sauce into a syrup dispenser and serve alongside bread pudding while still warm.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/glazed-donut-bread-pudding-dreamy-custard-sauce-666173", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simple Nourished Living", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Caramel-Chocolate-Oatmeal-Mini-Bars-525463.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 525463, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Caramel Chocolate Oatmeal Mini-Bars", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 13.85, "creditText": "Simple Nourished Living", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup packed brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "6 tablespoon butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 package (14 ounces) caramel candies, unwrapped", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "caramel candies", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soft-caramels.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 14.0, "id": 19074, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup milk chocolate morsels", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "milk chocolate morsels", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10019146, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup quick or old-fashioned oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "old-fashioned oats", "metaInformation": ["quick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://simple-nourished-living.com/2011/10/caramel-chocolate-oatmeal-mini-bars-recipe/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg", "id": 404770, "name": "baking paper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg", "id": 405907, "name": "mixing bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg", "id": 404646, "name": "baking pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
