Continue to stir and melt the last 1/4 cup butter in the sauce cooking just long enough for the eggs to cook and the sauce to thicken.Place two egg cups on each plate and spoon the hollandaise sauce over each one.

Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak. Sprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called \"dry sauting.) Once the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.2 Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Saut the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms. Add the large can of crushed tomatoes. Add one cup of water. Stir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.3 Once sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water. (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil. When the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water. As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other. Prepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets. Place the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.4 Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350F. Spread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.) Place a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3 layers of noodles, each layer with 6 noodles. Then we had 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.) Sprinkle half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Sprinkle half of the defrosted, drained, and excess moisture squeezed out spinach over the ricotta. Sprinkle half of the Mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino cheese. Then spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the Mozzarella. Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce if using.5 Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and Mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the Mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil. Layer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.6 Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges. Bake at 350F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.Take the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve.

Remove the cauliflower and spread it on a towel to cool.Once cool, wrap the cauliflower in a towel and squeeze every last bit of water and liquid out of it over your sink. When you think you're finished, squeeze again! You want all of the moisture out. Place the cauliflower in a large (dry) bowl. Stir in the cheeses, seasonings and spices and eggs, mixing until combined. You want to end with a ball of cauliflower dough, so you might need to use your hands to pull it together.Place the dough ball on a piece of parchment paper (no larger than your pizza stone) and press the dough into a circle, making sure the crust is thin. I like to go about 1/4 inch in thickness. Gently pick up the parchment paper and place the entire crust (parch and all) on your pizza stone. Bake for 10 t0 12 minutes, or until golden. They key here is make the crust crisp and sturdy enough so it doesn't crumble or break apart.Once the crust is golden, (gently) remove it and cover it in your desired toppings. I do sauce first, then cheese and everything listed about, along with more cheese on top. Make the pizza however you'd like! Very carefully transfer the pizza (again, still on parchment) back to the pizza stone. Have someone else help you or use a pizza peel. Bake the pizza for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Cover with extra parmesan. Serve immediately!Note: large slices are difficult to *pick up* - you may need a knife and fork.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pizza-supreme-on-cauliflower-crust-717356", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Closet Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Peach-Amaretti-Crumble-249066.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 249066, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peach Amaretti Crumble", "pricePerServing": 209.22, "creditText": "Closet Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup almonds (sliced)", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "almonds", "metaInformation": ["sliced", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12061, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup amaretti cookies (crushed)", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "amaretti cookies", "metaInformation": ["crushed", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/amaretti.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 93766, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup amaretto", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "amaretto", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/temporary-orange-liqueur.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10014534, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup butter (melted)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 pounds ripe peaches (pealed, stoned and sliced)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peaches", "metaInformation": ["ripe", "sliced", "(pealed, stoned and )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9236, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 43.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.closetcooking.com/2010/08/peach-amaretti-crumble.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 25, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Mix the flour, amaretti cookies, almonds, brown sugar and butter and pour onto the peaches.3.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/amaretti.jpg", "id": 93766, "name": "amaretti cookies"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "id": 19334, "name": "brown sugar"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "id": 12061, "name": "almonds"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg", "id": 9236, "name": "peach"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "id": 1001, "name": "butter"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 20081, "name": "all purpose flour"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Bake in a preheated 350F oven until it is bubbling and the top is golden brown, about 30-45 minutes.", "number": 2, "ingredients": []}], "name": ""}], "aggregateLikes": 530, "instructions": "Directions:1.

Set aside;In a separate bowl, whisk oil, buttermilk and egg; pour this over reserved flour mixture. Stir lightly with your fingers until the ingredients come together to form a fairly smooth dough. If your dough is too soft, add extra flour until you reach the desired consistency. Your dough should be soft, slightly tacky, but not sticky.You will now have to divide that dough into 3 unequal pieces: one which will be approximately  of the recipe; then divide the rest in half to get your other two pieces.Form each piece into a thick disc and wrap individually with plastic wrap. Refrigerate while you work on the filling (or at least 30 minutes).Coat a large, heavy skillet generously with cooking spray or olive oil and heat over very high heat. While this is happening, mix all the spices together in a large plate. Dredge the chicken legs in that spice mixture making sure that all sides are well coated. Add the legs to the hot pan and sear them nice and good on both sides, until a nice crust forms, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the legs to a large stock pot, cover with water and add the leftover spices that didnt get used to coat the turkey legs. Bring that to a boil then lower heat, cover partly and simmer until meat falls loose from the bones, about 2 to 3 hours. Remove the legs from their cooking liquid (but do not discard it) and allow them to cool for a while, until you can safely handle them and remove all the meat from the bones. Discard bones; set meat and cooking liquid aside in separate containers.  Cut the turkey breast into small cubes and grind it in 2-3 batches in your food processor, on pulse, until it has the consistency of ground meat.In a large saucepan, cook the onion over medium high heat until it takes a slight golden coloration and becomes fragrant. Add spices (from salt to rosemary) and ground turkey meat and continue cooking until meat turns completely opaque. Add orange juice, vanilla extract and 1 cup of the cooking liquid.Cover loosely and simmer over low heat, stirring from time to time, until the liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes.Add meat from turkey legs, another cup of cooking liquid (or water) and resume cooking, stirring from time to time, until meat starts to fall apart and once again, liquid is almost completely gone. Add buckwheat groats, apricots, prunes and chestnuts, as well as another cup and a half of cooking liquid (or water). Resume cooking until all water is absorbed and groats are fully cooked. Stir in pistachios and set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 400FOn a floured surface, roll out the 2 larger dough balls to form a 10-11 inch disc. Fit into two 9 deep pie dishes and let excess hang to the sides. Divide meat filling between the two pies and fold excess dough back over the meat. Roll final piece of dough on a floured surface and cut out shapes with a cookie cutter of your choice. Arrange cookie cut-outs in a pretty fashion around the crust and/or in the middle of the pie.  To insure proper sticking, you may brush the back of your cut-outs with a tiny bit of water or milk.Place in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, until the crust gets really nice and golden brown.

After an hour, pat them dry and proceed with the next step.Once dry, shallow-fry the zucchini in olive oil, to which you will have added a clove or two of garlic. The zucchini rounds should fit loosely in one layer, so you will probably need to proceed in batches. Allow the rounds to brown a bit on one side, until nicely spottled but not uniformly brown (see photo) and then transfer them to a shallow bowl while you fry the next batch.You sprinkle each layer of fried zucchini with salt (go easy if you've salted them as a first step), pepper, roughly torn or chopped mint leaves and some white wine vinegar.Continue frying, layering and seasoning the zucchini rounds until you have used them all up. Allow the zucchini to marinate for at least an hour. The flavor improves with time, and it is even better the next day.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/zucchine-a-scapece-piquant-fried-zucchini-606958", "dishTypes": ["antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "A Healthy Life for Me", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Kentucky-Buck-Cocktail-486141.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 486141, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Kentucky Buck Cocktail", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 240.29, "creditText": "A Healthy Life for Me", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "angostura bitters", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "dashes", "unitShort": "dashes", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93653, "unit": "dashes"}, {"originalString": "2 ounces bourbon", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "bourbon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bourbon.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10014037, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "Spicy Ginger Soda (substitute ginger ale)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["(substitute ginger ale)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "3/4 ounce lime juice, about 1 lime", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9160, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "Lime Wedge", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime wedge", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9159, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "1 medium strawberry, hulled", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "strawberry", "metaInformation": ["hulled", "medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/strawberries.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9316, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 6.0, "sourceUrl": "http://ahealthylifeforme.com/kentucky-buck-cocktail/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/strainer.png", "id": 405600, "name": "sieve"}], "step": "In a martini shaker add strawberry and smash to release juices, add ice, juice, bourbon and bitters.In a high ball glass add ice and pour through strainer into glass.
