Transfer the dressing to a mixing bowl, and stir in the walnuts and tarragon.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Place the dandelion greens and the chard in a large bowl. Pour 2 tablespoons (or more to taste) of the dressing over the greens, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat. In a separate mixing bowl, toss the sliced beets in 1 tablespoon of the dressing, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Divide the greens among four to six serving plates, and garnish with the sliced beets and the Cheese Crisps. If desired, spoon more dressing over each salad.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Note:  Banyuls vinegar is made from Banyuls wine, which is a fortified wine from southern France and is considered to be the French version of port. Banyuls vinegar has a sweet and nutty flavor, which is generally thought to be milder than red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar. It tastes something like a cross between balsamic vinegar and sherry vinegar and either can be used as a good substitute. Banyuls vinegar can be found in specialty markets.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Cheese Crisps                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat, or parchment paper.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Spacing them 1 to 2 inches apart, place 1-tablespoon mounds of the cheese on the Silpat. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook until the cheese melts and turns golden brown, about 7 minutes.                                                                                                                              11                                                                            Remove from the oven and set aside to cool on the baking sheet.

Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, another 30 seconds.Stir the spaghetti sauce and the undrained tomatoes into the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.In a small bowl, combine the egg and the ricotta cheese.Spray 2 9x13-inch baking dishes with nonstick cooking spray. (Make sure one is freezer safe. I like to use a disposable aluminum pan.)In each of the pans, layer one fourth of each of the drained pasta, the tomato sauce, the sausage, the ricotta mixture, cheddar cheese, and then the mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers.Cover the casserole that you are going to eat with foil, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and cook an additional 15 minutes, until heated through and the cheese is melted. Top with sliced green onions before serving.Let the second casserole cool completely, the place a piece of plastic wrap over the top. Cover tightly with foil and freeze.When ready to bake, allow the casserole to unthaw in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Carefully remove the foil and discard the plastic wrap. Recover the casserole with the foil and bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes, then remove the foil and bake an additional 10-15 minutes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cheesy-kielbasa-pasta-casserole-freezer-friendly-802876", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simply Delicious Food", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Vegetarian-lasagna-with-basil-pesto-and-ricotta-618059.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 60, "id": 618059, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Vegetarian lasagna with basil pesto and ricotta", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 273.35, "creditText": "Simply Delicious Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bd-3/4 cup basil pesto", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "basil pesto", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pesto.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93698, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "250g uncooked lasagna sheets", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "lasagna sheets", "metaInformation": ["uncooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lasagna-noodles.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 10620420, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 cup mozzarella, grated", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "mozzarella", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mozzarella-fresh.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1026, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "500g mushrooms, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 500.0, "id": 11260, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 fresh oregano sprig", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "oregano", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2027, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1.5 cups ricotta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "ricotta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1036, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "salt & pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "Salt & Pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 fresh thyme sprigs", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "thyme sprigs", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2049, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2-3 cups (approximately 2 x 400g tins) chopped tomatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["chopped", "(approximately 2 x 400g tins)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11529, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 94.0, "sourceUrl": "http://simply-delicious-food.com/2014/10/28/vegetarian-lasagna-basil-pesto-ricotta/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 20, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/casserole-dish.png", "id": 404635, "name": "casserole dish"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "To make the tomato sauce, saut the mushrooms in a splash of oil until golden brown then add the garlic, tomatoes and herbs.
