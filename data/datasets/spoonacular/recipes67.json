Slowly add the oil while blending on low to make the emulsification.   Taste and adjust seasoning.   For the candied shallots   In a small sauce pot, heat sugar and vinegar to a simmer.   With a mandolin, slice shallots thin and place in a bowl and toss with salt and pepper and the thyme springs.   Pour the hot vinegar mixture over seasoned shallots, set aside to cool, stirring once or twice to make sure all shallots are in the liquid. * You can always press with another small bowl to avoid stirring.   For assembly  With a mandolin, slice watermelon radish thin and place in cold water. Also slice the Easter egg radish oblong about 1/4-inch thick and place in cold water. The water helps bleed out some color so it doesnt change the whole salad pink. Soak for about 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, add the drained-soaked radishes, orange and grapefruit segments, mint, candied shallots and cranberries, mint vinaigrette season with salt and pepper. Toss together, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. On a large round plate assemble the salad with the thin slices or watermelon radish on the bottom spread out carpaccio-esque, spread out the remaining salad, top with micro greens and toasted almonds.

Lay a piece of waxed paper on a work surface, and place the balls of dough on the paper.  Cut another piece of waxed paper and put it over the top of the dough.  Use the bottom of a cup to flatten each ball into a disc about 3 inches across and 1/4\u201d \u2013 1/2\u201d thick.  Remove the top piece of waxed paper, and using your fingers, make a small lip on the edges of the discs.  Carefully transfer the discs to the hot oil and cook for about 1 minute on each side.  Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.  Repeat with the remaining dough.Meanwhile, make the Avocado Cream:  Remove the pits from the avocados.  Use a spoon to remove the flesh of the avocado from the skin, then dice.  Place in a food processor or blender.  Add the cilantro, lime juice and sour cream.  Process until smooth.  Season to taste with salt.  To assemble the sopes:  Heat up the refried beans over low heat.  Take a sope, top it with about 2 teaspoons of refried beans.

                          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.Add the butter to a large skillet over medium heat and add the mushrooms and garlic. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes, then add the wine and cook until evaporated.Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions, leaning toward the al dente side. Do not overcook; this will take 1 to 2 minutes!Add the cream to the skillet with the mushrooms. Drain the pasta (reserving some of the pasta water) and add the pasta to the mushrooms, along with the fontina, Parmesan, Romano, goat cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Stir gently to combine, adding hot pasta water as needed for consistency. Don't overmix; if there are little clumps of cheese here and there, it's fine! Taste and add more salt if needed. The mixing stage should happen very quickly.Turn the pasta out into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.                                                            You can use the 4 cheeses above, or whatever 4 cheeses you'd like!

                                   For the dough: If using fresh yeast, mix the water and yeast together in the bowl of a stand mixer until the yeast is dissolved. If using active dry yeast, mix the water and yeast in the bowl and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Using the dough hook, beat in the flour and salt and mix until a smooth, slightly elastic dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes; do not knead. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn the dough to coat, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, and up to 48 hours, to proof.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape each piece by using the palm of your hand to rotate the dough clockwise until a tight, compact ball has formed. Turn the dough over. Working from the outside in, pinch and twist the edges of the dough into the center to make a very tight ball. Put the dough on a baking sheet and return to the refrigerator to rest for at least 4 hours, and up to 12 hours.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            For the pizzas: Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F, with a pizza stone on a rack in the top third of the oven. Let heat for 1 hour. Remove the pizza dough from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before baking.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            While the oven heats, place 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until it is limp, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 7 minutes, until the edges are golden. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Add the clams, cover the pot, and cook until the clams start to open, about 10 minutes. As they open, transfer them to a large bowl. When all the clams are cooked, simmer the liquid in the pot until it reduces to a thick glaze, about 10 minutes. Add the cream, bring to a simmer, and reduce by a quarter, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and set aside. It thickens as it cools.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Meanwhile, when the clams are cool, pluck out the meat and discard the shells.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Turn a large baking sheet upside down, or use a pizza peel. Dust the surface with flour. Form one piece of the dough into a 12-inch round and set it on the baking sheet or peel.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Working quickly, paint the entire surface of the pizza with one-fourth of the glaze. Scatter the clams over the pizza and sprinkle with chili flakes.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Jiggle the pizza gently on the pan (or peel) to make sure it is not sticking (if it is, loosen it and sprinkle a little more flour under the area where it stuck). Slide the pizza onto the hot stone, making sure to start at the stone\u2019s back end so that the entire pizza will fit on it.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Cook the pizza for 3 minutes. Turn on the broiler. Broil the pizza until golden, crisp, and a bit blistery and charred in places, 2 to 4 minutes (watch it carefully to see that it does not burn). If you don\u2019t have a peel, use tongs to slide the pizza onto a large platter. Drizzle with oil and scatter with one-fourth of the parsley.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Andrew\u2019s Note: Finish this pizza with a squeeze of lemon juice.

Evenly insert the peanut butter cups into the batter, pushing them down so the top is almost flush with the surface of the dough. Evenly insert the M&Ms into the batter, pushing them down to anchor. Bake for about 28 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. \u00a0If your pie has risen in the center, it will deflate as it cools. Allow pie to cool in pan for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving; however, for optimal results, cool overnight because it gives the flavors a chance to marry and the pie to really set up fully. Pie will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months (color may leech from the M&Ms if you freeze it).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/triple-peanut-butter-cookie-pie-520643", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/red-white-and-blue-fruit-salad-751130.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 751130, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Red, White and Blue Fruit Salad", "preparationMinutes": 70, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9050, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup sliced fresh ginger (from one 4-inch piece)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh ginger", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "sliced", "(from one 4-inch piece)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19296, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "Zest of 1 lime plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime zest", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lime.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1009159, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup shredded and sweetened coconut", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sweetened shredded coconut", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "sweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 12179, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "8 cups 1-inch watermelon cubes (about 1/2 small seedless watermelon)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "watermelon cubes", "metaInformation": ["seedless", "small", "( 1/2 watermelon)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/watermelon.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 8.0, "id": 9326, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 43.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/red-white-and-blue-fruit-salad.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 17, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Combine the ginger, honey and 1 cup water in a small saucepan.

                                            Make the fruit layer: In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, melt the butter until just bubbling. Add the brown sugar and any other ingredients except the fruit and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely melted and the mixture begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Arrange two layers of the fruit in a decorative pattern to cover the brown sugar mixture in the bottom of the skillet. Set aside while you make the cake batter.                                                                                     2                                              Make the cake batter: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Set aside.                                                                                     3                                              In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla paste and beat to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. With the mixer on low speed, beat in half of the flour mixture, then add the milk and mix to combine, then add the last of the flour mixture. Mix only until the flour mixture is just incorporated. Spread the batter over the fruit, being careful not to move the fruit around too much. You may smooth the top, but don\u2019t worry too much because everything will settle as it bakes.                                                                                     4                                              Bake for 45 minutes, until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the skillet and you can see the syrup bubbling around the sides. The center should feel set to the touch. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes.                                                                                     5                                              Run a knife around the edge of the skillet, then very carefully place a plate (much larger than the diameter of the skillet) over the top of the skillet and flip the skillet over to turn the cake out onto the plate. There will be wonderful, oozing syrup escaping around the sides.

the vanilla until smooth in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the whipping cream and whip to soft peaks. Set aside while you make the French toast.For the syrup: Combine syrup and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, and remove from the heat.Let syrup sit for 10 minutes to cool. Remove the cinnamon stick and return to heat. Bring the syrup to simmer again, and whisk in the guava. Serve warm.For the toast: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Whisk together the  milk, sugar, cinnamon and eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Place the bread slices in a shallow dish and pour the egg mixture on top.While the bread soaks, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan or  nonstick griddle over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers. Fry the bread in batches until golden brown on the bottom. Lower the heat slightly, flip the bread and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and the bread is cooked through as well. Keep warm in the oven while you make the remaining breadTo serve, smear some cream cheese whipped cream on each piece of warm bread. Top with some of the guava maple syrup and a mint sprig.

"instructions": "<p>Remove the butter, eggs, and milk from the fridge 20-30 minutes before you begin mixing the batter to give them a chance to warm up slightly.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Prepare a 10 cup Bundt pan by greasing it, and sprinkling it with white rice flour, turning and tapping the pan until the inside is completely covered. Tap out the excess flour.Whisk together the first 9 ingredients until they are thoroughly combined. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy and light in colour, this takes about 4-6 minutes. Scrape down the bowl.Whisk the eggs to break them apart. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the whisked eggs into the butter/sugar mixture. This should take about 40-60 seconds. Scrape the bowl down again, and add the vanilla extract. Increase the speed to medium, and beat until the batter looks nice and smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary.With the mixer on low, add in half of the dry ingredients. Mix until nearly blended, then slowly add the milk. Add the remaining dry ingredients, scrape the sides of the bowl, then beat for 30 seconds on medium speed.Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan, spreading the batter even in the pan. Give the pan a few good taps on the counter to ensure there are no air bubbles trapped at the bottom of the batter.Bake in the preheated oven for 60-65 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean and the top bounces back when gently pressed.Move Bundt pan to a wire rack, and let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Place a cooling rack on top of the pan, and carefully turn over, giving the pan a little shake if necessary to release it from the pan.Let the cake cool completely before serving. The cooled cake can be stored on the counter for up to 3 days if it has been wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gluten-free-vanilla-bundt-cake-540022",

Make a well in the center of the sugar. Set aside.Place water in a small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water (dont dump the gelatin in as this may create lumps.) Let the gelatin sit in the water for 5 minutes, without stirring, to soften.Turn the stovetop heat on low to medium-low, heat and stir the gelatin until dissolved, do not let the mixture boil. Add the glucose or corn syrup, glycerin, and shortening; heat and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in flavoring.Pour the gelatin mixture into the well of powdered sugar. Mix together with a wooden spoon to incorporate as much of the powdered sugar as possible.Turn the fondant mixture out onto a pastry mat or pastry board, or clean counter-top greased with vegetable shortening. Lightly grease your hands with vegetable shortening and knead the fondant until it is smooth and pliable, 5 to 8 minutes. You may need to add additional shortening to the work surface and your hands if they start getting sticky. Tip: If the fondant feels sticky, knead in additional powdered sugar using about 1 tablespoon at a time. If the fondant feels too dry knead in a bit of shortening. Kneading fondant is like kneading bread dough; however fondant is much stiffer and heavier than dough.Shape the fondant into a thick disk and rub a thin coating of shortening over the entire surface to keep the fondant from drying out. Wrap the fondant disc tightly in at least two layers of plastic wrap and then place in a resealable plastic bag or airtight container and store at room temperature to rest and cure for at least 8 to 12 hours or overnight. Tip: The fondant can be used immediately but it is easier to use if left to cure for at least 8 to 12 hours. Fondant can be stored up to 2 months at room temperature if it is wrapped tightly.When ready to use, remove the cured fondant from the plastic and knead for several minutes to warm the fondant until it is smooth and pliable. You probably wont need any vegetable shortening on the rolling surface for this kneading, however if it starts to stick use a little shortening on the rolling surface and your hands.If the fondant is stiff and difficult to knead, microwave for about 15 seconds to warm it up. If the fondant seems too dry you can knead a small amount of vegetable shortening in, or if it seems too sticky knead a small amount of powdered sugar or cornstarch in. After kneading, the fondant temperature should be between 75 to 80 degrees using an instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature.Roll the fondant with a rolling pin on a clean and smooth countertop, marble board, pastry board, or non-stick pastry mat. Lightly dust the work surface with powdered sugar or cornstarch or a mixture of both. When rolling the fondant, be sure to lift and turn the fondant frequently to make sure the fondant is not sticking to the rolling surface. As you lift and move the fondant you will want to frequently redust the work surface with more powdered sugar or cornstarch to ensure the fondant doesnt stick. Once you start rolling dont flip the fondant over.Roll the fondant in a circle, or the desired shape that is large enough to cover the cake and sides along with a little excess that will be trimmed off at the end. Roll the fondant  inch thick for covering cakes as it will be easiest to handle.Fondant dries out quickly. Once the fondant is rolled, dont let it sit, immediately place and smooth on the cake before it has a chance to dry out and harden.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/classic-rolled-fondant-672091", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 720, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Sumptuous Spoonfuls", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Double-Dark-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Swirl-Muffins-553079.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 553079, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Double Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl Muffins", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Sumptuous Spoonfuls", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, melted", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "creamy peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10116098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup good quality dark chocolate chips, chopped", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dark chocolate chips", "metaInformation": ["dark", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10019071, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 egg (or 2 egg whites)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["(or 2 egg whites)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "nonfat greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["plain"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19165, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup whole-wheat flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "whole-wheat flour", "metaInformation": ["whole-wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20080, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 44.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.sumptuousspoonfuls.com/double-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-swirl-muffins/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 176, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add butter; cover and process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the brown sugar, molasses and egg; cover and process until blended. Wrap dough in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until firm.                                                                                            Unwrap dough; knead until smooth, about 8 times. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut out eight trees with a floured 5-in. tree-shaped cookie cutter.

Place 2 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400\u00b0 for 6 minutes. Using a plastic straw, cut out circles in a random pattern on the trees (so candlelight can shine through). Bake 6-7 minutes longer or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.                                                                                            For icing, in a large bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, meringue powder and cream of tartar. Add water; beat on low speed for 1 minute or until very stiff.                                                                                             Cut a small hole in the corner of a pastry or plastic bag; insert a #5 round pastry tip. Outline trees and decorate trees with garland and ornaments as desired. Pipe icing onto the bottom edge of each tree; set tree on a round base about 1/2 in. from edge. For additional support, pipe another line of icing along the back of tree where it joins the base. Prop trees with small glasses until icing has set. Let stand overnight to dry completely. Store in an airtight container.                                                                                            Place a votive candle or tea light on the base of holder behind the tree, or attach a birthday candle with a dab of icing on the base. Be aware that the heat will eventually soften the icing.

Using a double layer of foil, make a barrier down the center of a 20cm square tin (or use a Battenberg tin), then line each compartment with 2 pieces of baking parchment. Put all the cake ingredients except the food colouring in a large mixing bowl and blend with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Tip half the cake mixture into one side of the tin. Quickly mix the food colouring into the remaining cake mixture. When you have a smooth and vivid pink colour, scrape this mixture into the other side of the tin, then spread both mixtures to the edges of their sections. Bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Place the cakes on a chopping board and trim the sides of each one to give you a straight edge. Cut each one in half lengthways to give you 2 pink and 2 plain rectangular sponges, using a ruler if you want to be really exact. If the sponges are a little taller than they are wide, trim some sponge from the tops as well \u2013 this will ensure you have a perfect square when you come to assemble the cake.Heat the apricot jam in a small pan or the microwave, then sieve it. Lightly dust a work surface with a little icing sugar, then roll out a quarter of the marzipan to a rectangle roughly 20 x 10cm. Brush the surface with the warm apricot jam, then place 1 plain sponge and 1 pink sponge side by side on top, brushing the middle of the cakes with a little jam to stick them together. Brush the top of the cakes with more jam, then place the remaining sponges on top, with more jam in between, in a chequerboard pattern.Roll out the remaining marzipan to a rectangle roughly 20 x 25cm. Brush any remaining jam over the outside of the assembled cake. Using a rolling pin to help, lift the marzipan over the cake. Smooth it over the top and sides, and press gently into the corners so it wraps the cake tightly. Trim any excess marzipan about 1cm from the sides of the cake, and trim a thin slice off either end to neaten. To finish, crimp the marzipan around the base by pinching with your finger and thumb.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/easiest-ever-battenberg-213191", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/chocolate-ice-cream-310752.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 310752, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chocolate Ice Cream", "preparationMinutes": 488, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 large egg yolks", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolks", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 cups half-and-half", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "half n half", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1049, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "9 ounces sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 9.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 ounces unsweetened cocoa powder, approximately 1/2 cup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19165, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 66.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/chocolate-ice-cream-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 53, "aggregateLikes": 33, "instructions": "Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Place the cocoa powder along with 1 cup of the half-and-half into a medium saucepan over medium heat and whisk to combine. Add the remaining half-and-half and the heavy cream. Bring the mixture just to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and remove from the heat.In a medium mixing bowl whisk the egg yolks until they lighten in color. Gradually add the sugar and whisk to combine. Temper the cream mixture into the eggs and sugar by gradually adding small amounts, until about 1/3 of the cream mixture has been added. Pour in the remainder and return the entire mixture to the saucepan and place over low heat. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon and reaches 170 to 175 degrees F. Pour the mixture into a container and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stir in the vanilla extract. Place the mixture into the refrigerator and once it is cool enough not to form condensation on the lid, cover and store for 4 to 8 hours or until the temperature reaches 40 degrees F or below.Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's directions. This should take approximately 25 to 35 minutes. Serve as is for soft serve or freeze for another 3 to 4 hours to allow the ice cream to harden.

Put the whole cumin seeds in a small skillet and set over medium heat. Toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant and browned. The seeds will start to pop. Remove from the heat, cool completely, and grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.2.  Put the cilantro leaves and chile in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the yogurt, lemon juice, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the finely ground cumin.3. Stir well, season with salt, pepper, and more sugar to taste, and set aside.Make the samosas4. Put the oil in a large deep skillet and set over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent and softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute, then add the coriander, turmeric, cayenne, and remaining ground cumin and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to break down, 5 minutes, and stir in the tamarind paste. Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until the meat is completely cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, remove from the heat, and cool to room temperature.5. Put one of the spring roll wrapper rectangles on your work surface so that the short side is facing you.6. Put 2 tablespoons of the filling 1/4 inch from the bottom of the rectangle, then fold the bottom left corner over the filling so that the bottom edge meets the right edge to form a triangle. Press the edges to seal, then fold the triangle over the top edge and continue to fold along the edges to create a triangle. Seal the end of the spring roll wrapper with a little water. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.7. Pour oil to a depth of 3 inches in a heavy, deep saucepan and heat to 350F (175C). Carefully add the samosas and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp. Do not overcrowd; work in batches if necessary. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.8.

Arrange the Nilla wafers over the top of the rack and set aside.Prepare the marshmallow. Fit a large pastry bag with a 1/2 inch round tip.Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.Put 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl and sprinkle the packet of gelatin over it. Stir.In a small saucepan, combine the remaining 8 teaspoons of water, sugar, corn syrup and salt. Using medium heat, heat without stirring until a candy thermometer (I use a deep fry) registers 240 degrees (soft ball stage).While the syrup heats, beat the eggs with the whisk attachment until stiff peaks form. If eggs form peaks before syrup reaches 240, stop the mixer. When the syrup hits 240 degrees, turn the mixer back on and pour it into the egg whites in a thin stream down the side of the bowl starting with a few tablespoons and increasing the flow. Use a rubber scraper to make sure you get it all.Quickly scrape the gelatin into the still-hot saucepan and stir it so that it thins and dissolves from the residual heat. Add it to the mixer while it is still going. Add the vanilla and the coffee powder and keep on beating for 5 minutes or until bowl feels cool and mixture is thick enough to pipe. Pipe mounds of marshmallow on top of the cookies and let the marshmallow topped cookies sit on a rack for at least two hours. After the two hours have passed, you can move on to dipping OR you can freeze the cookies and dip them when convenient.For dipping, use your favorite method. I recommend tempering the chocolate, but that takes practice. So temper the chocolate if you know how, or just melt the chocolate and fat in a double boiler. Dunk each cookie one by one in chocolate and lift with two forks, letting chocolate run down the sides.

Add the swiss chard and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Drain into a large colander and allow to cool completely.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Saute the onions until soft and translucent. Add the green onions and garlic and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat.Once the swiss chard has cooled, place in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out an excess moisture over a sink. Once squeezed dry, chop finely.Combine chopped swiss chard, cooked onion mixture, and crumbled feta in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Set rack in center of oven. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper--prepare a clean work surface and set the melted butter and pastry brush within easy reach before you start assembling the purses.Remove the thawed phyllo dough from the fridge. Stack the phyllo sheets on top of each other.Using a sharp knife, cut the sheets lengthwise in half and cut each length crosswise into thirds, making 6 sections per sheet of phyllo.Cover phyllo with a barely damp kitchen towel to prevent from drying.Place one square of phyllo on a work surface. Brush lightly with melted butter. Top with a second square of phyllo, off-setting the corners. Brush lightly with melted butter. Top with a third square of phyllo, off-setting the corners again to form a rough star shape.Place two tablespoons of filling in the center of the phyllo. Enclose filling by bringing together two opposite sides. Continue to gather the edges while twisting and pleating them slightly to form a purse. Brush the top and sides lightly with clarified butter.Place the purses on the baking sheet (leaving an inch or two of space around each one) and bake at 375 degrees until tops are golden brown, roughly 18-25 minutes--if baking in batches, allow baking sheet to cool completely between each one.Remove from oven and place baking sheet on rack to cool for 5-10 minutes.
