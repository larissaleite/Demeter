Poke a few holes in the top of the squash and roast until its soft and a fork easily slides in and out. About 45 minutes. Let squash cool then scoop the flesh out from the skin and discard the skin.Mash together 1 cup of the soft squash with the butter, maple syrup, cinnamon and salt. Stir until smooth. (Taste and add more maple and/or spices to your liking - it should taste pumpkin pie-like). Store puree in the fridge until ready to use.For the bars:: Line an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish with parchment paper. In a food processor pulse together the flour, walnuts, brown sugar, butter and salt until it becomes crumbly. (Similar to the texture of wet sand). If the crumble is too dry, add a few drops of water and pulse again.Scoop  cup of the crumble mixture and set it aside to use later for the topping.Press the rest of the crumble firmly and evenly into the baking dish. Bake the crust for about 20 minutes or until its lightly golden brown around the edges and dry to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. (note: the crust can be made and baked a day in advance)Spread the squash puree evenly over the pre-baked crust. Top with chocolate chips, shredded coconut and the remainder of the crumble mixture. (Optional: bake a few minutes more to toast the topping and melt the chocolate).Chill bars in the fridge for at least a few hours to set before slicing. To slice, use a knife to gently loosen the edges, then (very) carefully lift the parchment paper out of the pan. Use a sharp knife to slice bars into 1x2 inch rectangles. Enjoy, then store remaining bars in the fridge.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/buttercup-squash-crumble-bars-624761", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,
