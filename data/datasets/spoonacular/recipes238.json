(Although, if we're being honest, he's come to the dark side...he just doesn't like admitting it!) The way to his heart is egg casserole. Nate claims he had never had egg casserole until he met our family. For us, it's a common breakfast...both on holidays, and whenever all of us are together, since it serves so many.When I saw that Alexia sold hashed browns, I knew I wanted to use them in an egg dish...and I also knew I'd better share with Nate! Not only does Nate love egg casserole, but he also loves potatoes. Being married to a potato-hater means he doesn't get them all that often, so we try to hook him up when we can!I adapted a Cooking Light recipe, which took the best parts of breakfast--eggs, hashed browns, and bacon, and mixed them all up along with cheese, spinach, and mushrooms in a baked egg dish. Like most egg dishes, the majority of the work is done the night before, and you can easily swap in your favorite vegetables or sausage in place of bacon. I loved that the Alexia hashed browns come pre-seasoned with salt, pepper, onion, and garlic, boosting the overall flavor of the dish with no extra work on your part!Needless to say, this got rave reviews from Nate (and Ryan and I!).

Sprinkle with cornstarch, and mix until evenly combined. Set aside to marinate for 25 minutes.                            Heat half of the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in the chicken and shrimp, and cook until the chicken has turned white on the outside and is still a bit pink in the center; about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken and wipe the wok clean.                            Heat the remaining vegetable oil over high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn brown. Stir in the dried chiles and Szechwan peppercorns; cook and stir a few seconds until the peppers begin to darken. Add the red and green bell peppers, dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of rice wine, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a boil, stir in the chicken, and cook until the peppers are nearly tender, and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the peanuts and green onion until the green onion becomes limp. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil to serve.
