pan to medium-high heat.After the time is up, remove the steak from the freezer. Slice the steak across the grain and at slight angle into quarter inch thick pieces, give or take.Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil to the hot griddle and add the peppers, onions and a couple pinches of kosher salt. Let those sizzle, stirring occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes until soft. With your garlic press, squeeze in two cloves of garlic and stir it all around for a minute before removing the peppers and onions to a bowl or plate.Add another couple of tablespoons of oil to the griddle and then evenly distribute the sliced skirt steak onto the hot griddle. Let the steak form a dark sear for a few minutes before flipping and continuing to cook.Add a half tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and the half teaspoon of coarse cracked black pepper and stir. Add the peppers and onions to the cooked steak and cover with slices of pepper jack. Cover with a domed lid so the steam can help melt the cheese. Once melted stir it all together so the cheese is throughout the steak and peppers. Slice the French loaf in half, then horizontally stopping before going all the way through. Divide the cheesy-steak and peppers into each of the French loaves and serve hot. For four servings, cut the loaf into fourths before slicing horizontally and stuffing with the steak and peppers.

Add  tablespoon of butter and  tablespoon of the olive oil until the butter is melted then add 3 of the chicken breasts to the pan. Cook undisturbed until you can see that the chicken is cooking through on the one side, about 3-4 minutes. Use tongs to flip the chicken over once it is nicely browned and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes or until the thickest part of the chicken reaches 160 degrees F. Transfer to a plate and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm and rest. Wipe out the pan with paper towels and add  tablespoon of butter and the remaining olive oil. Repeat with the remaining three chicken breasts. Transfer to the plate with the other cooked chicken.Wipe out the pan again and over medium heat, and melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the mushrooms and leeks to the pan with a pinch of kosher salt. Cook while stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are softened and the leeks are becoming limp. Add the wine and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the cream or half and half, raise the heat to medium high and cook for 5 minutes or until the cream coats the back of a spoon and has slightly reduced. Stir in the last tablespoon of butter to add a bit of gloss and adjust the seasoning to taste.Add the chicken breasts back to the pan and top with the sauce, or transfer to serving plates and spoon sauce over them then.

Make the Crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss together the Oreo crumbs, melted butter and salt until all of the crumbs are moistened. Press into the bottom and two inches up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan in the freezer for 10 minutes. Bake for 7 minutes, or until crust is firm. Remove from oven and cool completely.2. Make the Caramel-Pecan Layer: In a small bowl, stir together the caramel sauce and pecans. Pour onto the cooled crust and gently spread into an even layer. Refrigerate while the cheesecake is prepared.3. Make the Cheesecake: Beat together the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until smooth and creamy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well until fully incorporated and scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition. Add the heavy cream and vanilla and beat until well combined, about 1 minute. Pour the batter on top of the caramel-pecan layer and bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until the edges are set, but the middle still jiggles a little.4. Keeping the oven door closed, turn off the oven and let the cheesecake rest in the oven for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven, and place the pan on a wire rack to cool completely, about an additional 2 hours. Once completely cool, refrigerate for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight).5. Make the Chocolate Ganache: Combine the heavy cream, corn syrup, chocolate and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. Set the glaze aside to cool and thicken at room temperature for 30 minutes.6. Pour the ganache over the top of the cheesecake, gently spreading it to the edges.

Allow it to cool for about 30 minutes in the pot.  Remove about 2 cups of the soup to a blender container and puree it smooth.  Stir the pureed mixture into the soup, and add more stock if necessary.  The soup should not be thick or gloppy, but loose and liquid.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Return the soup to the heat before serving; garnish with parsley, a dribble of olive oil and a grating of cheese.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Leftovers advice: Store extra soup for up to three days.

Add this to the butter mixture and beat until completely mixed.Scrape the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Flatten it out into a thick cake and wrap it in the plastic wrap. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.To make the fig filling, in a small heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the figs, brown sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, water and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 10 minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool completely before using it.When you are ready to make your cookies, position an oven rack in the center and heat your oven to 375 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.If the dough has been chilled for longer than 2 hours, leave it out at room temperature, until it becomes malleable. This dough is not the easiest to roll out because it crumbles, so pat and patch it with your fingers as necessary.On a well-floured surface, roll out the dough into a 15-inch long by 7-inch wide rectangle that is about \u00bc-inch thick.Cut the dough in half lengthwise and crosswise.Spoon \u00bcth of the fig filling evenly down each strip to one side of the center, stopping about \u00bd inch from the narrow ends and leaving a 1-inch margin on the filled side.Using a long metal spatula, carefully flip the long side of the dough over the filling to the other side. Seal the edges by pressing lightly all around with your fingertips.Using a spatula or spatulas, lift the rolls and transfer them to the parchment lined cookie sheets, seam side down. Press down to flatten. They should be about 1-1/2 inches wide.Repeat with the other 3 strips of cookie dough.Bake the fig bar strips for 15 minutes, or until delicately golden brown.

Stir until just melted, about 6 minutes; remove from the heat and whisk until smooth and shiny.Fill a large bowl halfway with ice water. Combine 2 egg yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, the cognac, vanilla and 2 tablespoons hot water in a separate heatproof bowl. Beat with a mixer until thick and pale yellow, about 7 minutes. Place the bowl over the pan of simmering water and continue beating until warm and tripled in volume, about 8 more minutes. Carefully rest the bowl in the ice water and beat until the mixture is cool and thick, about 2 more minutes. Gradually beat in the melted chocolate mixture until incorporated.Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate large bowl, beat 2 egg whites, the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and the salt until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Stir one-quarter of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture, then gently fold in the rest until incorporated. Transfer to four 8-ounce ramekins. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or overnight.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter or small knife, cut out 4 hearts (or circles) from the pastry. Brush with the beaten egg, transfer to the prepared baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 5 minutes. Bake until puffed and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely. Top each ramekin with whipped cream and a puff pastry heart.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

Dry fish with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Pour crumbs onto plate or wax paper and coat fish on both sides.

Lay sprayed side down into skillet. Spray other side. Make sprays quick but be sure to cover entire surface of fish and crumbs.Saute until brown (2-3 minutes) and flip to brown other side. (You could stop here and serve the fish with no sauce. It's delicious!) At this point, spoon light coating of pizza sauce over fish. Then sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of cheese over sauce. Continue to saute until bottom of fish is also brown and cheese is melted. Serve immediately.Optional:Layer fresh basil on top of fish and make a sandwich. I like the new thin buns at 100 calories a piece. Toast buns by spritzing with a little spray butter and saute in the same nonstick skillet or toast in toaster if you prefer a crunchier sandwich.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pizza-fish-622832", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Vegetarian Times", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/fines-herbes-potato-rosti-758223.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 758223, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Fines Herbes Potato Rosti", "creditText": "Vegetarian Times", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 tsp. fresh chervil, coarsely chopped", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chervil", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "coarsely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chervil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2008, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "4 tsp. fresh chives, coarsely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh chives", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "coarsely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11156, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "4 tsp. fresh parsley, coarsely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh parsley", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "coarsely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11297, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "4 tsp. fresh tarragon, coarsely chopped", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "fresh tarragon", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "coarsely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tarragon-dried.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2041, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbs. olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbs", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "2 large russet potatoes, peeled and grated (1 \u00bd lb.)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "russet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["grated", "large", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 11353, "unit": "lb"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 96.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/fines-herbes-potato-rosti/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 1111, "instructions": "1.

Add an additional 1 tablespoon water of water at a time until it does. Form the dough into a disk,; wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. In a food processor, process the sugars, the cinnamon, salt and flour for about 1 minute. Add butter; pulse 10 to 15 times, until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the pecans. Refrigerate the topping, covered, in a a medium bowl until ready to use. Peel, core and cut the apples into 1/4-inch-thick slices.    Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter starts to foam, allow it to cook until it starts to turn a warm brown color; watch very carefully!    Add the apples and saut\u00e9 for 5  minutes.    Combine the cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle it on the apples, and reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-low. Simmer the apples for about 1 minute.    Using a slotted spoon, transfer the apples from the skillet to a large baking sheet and arrange them in a single layer. This will keep them from getting soggy.    Pour the bourbon into the butter-sugar mixture in the skillet. Simmer the mixture over medium heat at least 5 minutes, until the alcohol burns off. Add the cream, and continue cooking about 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture is thick as pourable caramel. Allow to cool while preparing crust. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    Transfer the pie dough to a lightly sugared flat surface (I use powdered sugar in lieu of flour when making pie crusts for a sweet dish).    Roll it into a 1/8-inch-thick circle large enough to cover the bottom and sides of a 10-inch deep-dish pie plate. (To keep the dough from sticking, gently pick it up every once in a while and rotate it in place, adding more powdered sugar underneath if necessary.)    Wrap the dough lightly over the rolling pin, and set it in the un-greased pie plate. Press it into place, and crimp the outside edges with your finger or a fork.    Spread the apples evenly onto the crust; pour the filling over the apples and then sprinkle the topping evenly over the top. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the topping is brown.

Beat in the eggs and egg whites.  I did this in a stand mixer.Fold in the nuts and cranberries, and then slowly fold in the flour.The dough will be tacky, but divide it in half, and place each half on the baking sheet, and form two loaves, each about about 8x4.  It helps to lightly butter your hands.  Make sure the loaves are at 3\" apart so they won't merge when they bake.Bake for 24-28 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.  (don't overbake)Cool the pan on a rack for 15 minutes.Now move the loaves to a cutting board and cut each loaf into 1/4 inch slices.  Use a sharp serrated bread knife.  Lay out the slices on 2 baking sheets.  Bake on separate oven racks for 12 minutes, then flip the cookies over and switch the cookie sheets.   Bake another 5-7 minutes.  Turn off the oven and leave the cookies inside with the door closed, for about 10 minutes.  Let the cookies cool on a rack before dipping in chocolate.For the coating, make sure you have chopped your bark coating into small pieces, and then put it in a microwave safe bowl.  Microwave for 60 seconds, then stir.  If you need more time, microwave in super short bursts of 15 seconds, until is is melted smooth and glossy.  Stir it in between to help it melt.  Dip each biscotti halfway into the chocolate, let the excess drip off, and then lay it down on waxed or parchment paper to firm up.  Note:  I find it easiest to have the chocolate in a 2-cup glass measuring cup, that way the chocolate is deep enough for easy dipping.  As the chocolate level goes down, just tip the cup as you dip the last cookies, so that they get a good coating.When completely hardened, wrap the biscotti in cellophane to give or store.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cranberry-pistachio-biscotti-621638", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 31, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Averie Cooks", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Skinny-Oatmeal-Brown-Sugar-Muffins-626151.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 626151, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Skinny Oatmeal Brown Sugar Muffins", "preparationMinutes": 3, "creditText": "Averie Cooks", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup Silk Vanilla Dairy-Free Yogurt (Greek yogurt, sour cream, or lite sour cream may be substituted)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "fat free vanilla yogurt", "metaInformation": ["sour", "(Greek yogurt, cream, or lite cream may be substituted)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-vanilla-pudding.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 43261, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed (strongly recommend dark, although light brown may be substituted)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["dark", "light", "packed", "(strongly recommend , although brown may be substituted)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup old-fashioned whole-rolled oats (don't use quick cook or instant; they're finer and act more like flour and batter will be too dry)", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "old fashioned rolled oats", "metaInformation": ["dry", "quick", "(don't use cook or instant; they're finer and act more like flour and batter will be too )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 8120, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sugar-free pancake syrup (lite syrup or real maple syrup may be substituted)", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "pancake syrup", "metaInformation": ["sugar-free", "(lite syrup or real maple syrup may be substituted)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19113, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup Silk Unsweetened Vanilla Almondmilk (Silk Unsweetened Cashewmilk or another milk may be substituted)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened", "(Silk Cashewmilk or another milk may be substituted)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 23.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.averiecooks.com/2015/01/skinny-oatmeal-brown-sugar-muffins.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 11, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350F.

Around the center strip, overlap vegetables in a close spiral that lets slices mound slightly toward center. Repeat until dish is filled; all vegetables may not be needed.  Mix garlic, oil, and thyme leaves in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle over vegetables. Cover pan with foil and crimp edges to seal well. Bake until vegetables are tender when tested with a paring knife, about 2 hours. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes more. (Lightly cover with foil if it starts to brown.) If there is excess liquid in pan, place over medium heat on stove until reduced. (At this point it may be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Serve cold or reheat in 350-degree oven until warm.)  For vinaigrette, take a tablespoon of piperade from the baking dish, combine with oil, vinegar, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl.To serve, heat broiler and place byaldi underneath until lightly browned.

Bring the water, butter, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.3. Dump the flour into the boiling butter mixture all at once and, using a wooden spoon and good old elbow grease, mix until the flour clumps into a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Continue stirring over medium-high heat until the dough leaves an even, dry film on the bottom of the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. (Don\u2019t you dare skimp on this step.)4. Drop the dough into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the dough is just barely warm to the touch, about 5 minutes.5. Plop in an egg, increase the speed to medium, and beat until incorporated. The dough may look hopelessly soupy and broken at first, but fear not and continue mixing until the blob turns smooth and slick. Repeat with the rest of the eggs, adding them 1 at a time. Using a spoon, stir in the prosciutto, cheese, rosemary, thyme, and pepper.6. Drop rounded tablespoons of the dough, or use a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop to make plump mounds, on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Have a glass of cold water handy and dip the spoon in it every so often to help make the dough easier to scoop.7. Bake the puffs until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, reversing and rotating the sheets once halfway through baking. 8. Transfer the sheets to a wire rack to cool slightly. Then whip off your apron, pop as many puffs as can fit into your mouth, place the rest of the puffs on a platter, and offer them to your guests post haste. (You can bake these up to 2 hours in advance, then reheat them in a 350\u00b0F [176\u00b0C] oven for 5 to 7 minutes.

pineapple juice, mustard, sesame and olive oil, ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes if desired. Place salmon in large ziploc bag and add marinade. Place in refrigerator for up to 8 hours but at least 1 hour. You can also marinade it in a baking pan.Preheat oven to 400 degree F. Spray baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Remove salmon from ziploc bag and place skin side down on large baking pan lined with foil. Line pineapple next to salmon and brush leftover marinade on salmon and pineapple. Sprinkle with a little bit of extra brown sugar for extra caramelization. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until salmon easily flakes with fork. I usually broil my salmon for a min or two at the end to get an additional caramelization on top. Just be sure not to dry out your fish! 18 minutes is usually perfect timing for me! **See notes for additional information on cooking times.While salmon is cooking, prepare quinoa. Bring water and coconut milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low; add quinoa and cover; simmering until all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand another 5-10 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and set aside. Add in red onion and cilantro to quinoa. Once salmon is finished cooking, remove pineapple from baking sheet and fold into quinoa. Season with salt and lime juice to taste.Spoon pineapple quinoa evenly into 4 bowls or plates. Cut salmon into desired serving sizes and serve with quinoa. Garnish with a tablespoon or two of toasted almonds.
