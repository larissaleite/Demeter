Stir well until all of the granola is moistened (no there is not a better word to use). Spread the granola on the baking sheet in an even layer. Bake for 10 minutes, then flip. Bake for 10 minutes more, flipping again. Continue to bake for 15 more minutes, tossing the granola every 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the sea salt and let cool COMPLETELY. I find that granola clumps together best when it's still wet and air drys until cool. Once cool, break into clumps and pieces with your hands. Increase the oven heat to 400 degrees. Place the figs on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with salt. Roast the figs until caramely, about 20 minutes. Remove the figs and let cool slightly.Must I really tell you how to layer a parfait? Add some figs and granola to the bottom of the glass - cover with yogurt. I used a few extra drizzles of honey too since my yogurt was plain. Repeat the process two more times - or as many times as it takes to full up your parfait glass!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/salted-bourbon-vanilla-granola-and-caramelized-fig-parfaits-605019", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Vegetarian Times", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/red-cabbage-slaw-with-baked-tofu-and-peanut-dressing-760355.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 760355, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Red Cabbage Slaw with Baked Tofu and Peanut Dressing", "pricePerServing": 65.27, "creditText": "Vegetarian Times", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp. apple cider vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "apple cider vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 medium-sized carrot, peeled and grated", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrot", "metaInformation": ["grated", "medium-sized", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2-inch piece fresh ginger, cut into eight pieces (peeling unnecessary)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh ginger", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "cut into eight pieces (peeling unnecessary)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "inches", "unitShort": "inch", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "inch"}, {"originalString": "1 small clove garlic, peeled", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["small", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup thinly sliced green onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green onions", "metaInformation": ["green", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11291, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tsp. packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup unsalted, nonhydrogenated peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 16098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "6 cups shredded red cabbage", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red cabbage", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-cabbage.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 11112, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd Tbs. low-sodium tamari", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "tamari", "metaInformation": ["low-sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbs", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10116124, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "1 8-oz. pkg.
