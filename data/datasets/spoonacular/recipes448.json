Cut rectangles out in the same size of the top of your pastries.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Roll out small leaf shapes to add to the top of the rectangle for ears, and a small log in the center of the rectangle for the nose. With a knife or with your fingers, smooth these pieces down so that they adhere to the rectangle of fondant and have a seamless appearance. Add small ovals with pointed ends on to either side of the nose for the eyes. Add small pieces of pink icing on top of the ears, and yellow circles on top of the white yes. Finish the eyes with a dot of black gel writing icing.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            To finish, use a toothpick to draw on lips and freckles on the cheeks; if desired, add a small amount of yellow sprinkles to the temple area of the character.

In separate bowl or bag, thoroughly combine the panko, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, dried herbs and salt.Dip the frozen sticks in the flour, shaking off the excess. Then dip them in the egg, followed by the crumb mixture. Be sure to coat the ends, too. This coating will form a thin crust that will give structure to the cheese as it begins to soften.
