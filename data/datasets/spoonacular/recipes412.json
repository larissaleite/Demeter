Put the semisweet and white chocolates into 2 separate heatproof medium bowls. Fill 2 medium saucepans with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat; set the bowls of chocolate over the water to melt. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, melt the chocolates in a microwave at half power, for 1 minute, stir and then heat for another minute or until melted.)Once the chocolates are melted and smooth, remove from the heat. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Holding the strawberry by the stem, dip the fruit into the dark chocolate, lift and twist slightly, letting any excess chocolate fall back into the bowl. Set strawberries on the parchment paper. Repeat with the rest of the strawberries. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and drizzle the white chocolate over the dipped strawberries.Set the strawberries aside until the chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.Copyright 2003 Television Food Network, G.P.

Two Days Before: Make a double batch of the cookies and cream ice cream base and chill.2. One Day Before: Make the Cake. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, both flours, the cocoa, baking soda and salt. Gradually whisk the boiling water into the flour, adding about \u00bd cup of the water at a time, until all the water is added and you have a smooth, thick batter. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, blending well after each addition, then whisk in the oil. You should have a very thin but smooth batter.4. Pour the batter into the cake pan. Bake until the cake springs back to a light touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 30 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack. Remove the parchment and let cool completely.5. Prepare the Cake Pan: Spray an 8x3-inch round cake pan (or springform/cheesecake pan) with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment. Then cut two strips of parchment that are 3 inches wide by 14 inches long. Line the sides of the pan with the parchment strips, overlapping them slightly. spray a bit of nonstick spray where the ends overlap to help them adhere.6. Prepare the Cake Base: If your cooled cake has a domed top, trim off the domed portion with a long serrated knife to achieve a level surface.
