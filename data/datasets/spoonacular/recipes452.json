If you don't have enough brine to cover the whole turkey breast, just make sure the actual breast meat is submerged in the brine.4) Stick this in the fridge overnight to brine.5) When ready to cook, preheat oven to 475 degrees. Rinse off turkey breasts with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Discard brine.6) Slice apples into 1/4 inch slices. Add two slices of apple and the lemon (cut into eighths) into the cavity of the turkey.7) Set turkey, breast side up, in a roasting pan on a bed of the sliced apples.8) Cook turkey breast at 475 for 30 minutes. Then remove and insert digital thermometer.9) Turn oven heat down to 350 degrees and cook turkey until it registered 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast, probably about another 75-90 minutes. If you don't have a probe thermometer, I would check the temperature after 60 minutes and go from there. 10) Once the turkey is done, wrap it in foil and let it rest for 30 minutes.11) Slice off each breast and slice them across the grain into 1/8-1/4 inch slices.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/apple-cider-brined-turkey-breast-536739", "dishTypes": ["beverage", "drink"],

Add yolks; puree 15 seconds longer. Strain through sieve set over large metal bowl, pressing on solids with back of spatula to release as much puree as possible. Discard solids in sieve. Set metal bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk puree until thickened and thermometer registers 170\u00b0F., about 10 minutes. Remove from over water.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In 3 parts, alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the batter, beginning and ending with the dry. Mix until just combined. Fold in half of the coconut.Line a muffin pan with paper liners. Fill each liner 2/3 of the way with batter. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the tops are brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove to a baking rack and cool completely.Preheat oven to 300. Put the remaining coconut on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and toast for 10/15 minutes stirring every 5 minutes to prevent burning. Bake until coconut is golden brown.Meanwhile, combine cream cheese, butter, 1/4 c. mango puree and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat until fully incorporated. Add powdered sugar until desired consistency and taste is achieved.To Assemble: When cupcakes have cooled, cut a cone out of the top using a paring knife. remove the cut-out cake and spoon a tablespoon of mango curd into each cupcake. Replace the top part of the cone, cutting the tip to leave room for the filling. Frost cupcakes and sprinkle a little toasted coconut on each one.

Chop with 8 to 10 short pulses and add to barley mix.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Using bare hands or a spatula, stir together mixture until completely homogenous. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mixture can be refrigerated and stored for up to 5 days at this point or frozen in an airtight freezer bag for up to 3 months.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            When Ready To Serve: Add breadcrumbs to mixture and work them in with your hands. Make a sample patty. It should have the texture of ground beef and hold together easily. If not, add water a tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Divide mixture into eight patties about 4-inches across and 1/2 an inch thick. Patties must be cooked within 30 minutes of adding breadcrumbs (see note above).                                                                                                                            8                                                                            To Finish on a Griddle or in a Skillet: Heat three tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add four patties and cook without moving until first side is well-browned, about 3 minutes. I like to press a disk of sliced onion into the top side while it cooks. Flip burgers and top with cheese (if desired) and cook until second side is browned and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a toasted bun and serve with condiments as desired.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            To Finish on the Grill: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill with a medium-high fire. Rub the grill grates with an oil-soaked paper towel and add the burgers. Cook without moving until well-browned, about four minutes. Flip burgers, top with cheese if desired, and cook on second side until well browned, about 4 minutes longer.
