Break the graham crackers into small pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor along with the sugar and salt.  Pulse 8 times, until the cracker crumbs are semi-fine (they shouldn't be powdery but not in large shards either) and the crackers and sugar are combined.  Pour in the butter and pulse until the butter is blended in and the mixture isn't crumbly and holds its shape when you squeeze it, about twelve 1-second pulses.  Transfer the crust to a 9-inch springform pan and push and press the crumb mixture into the bottom and two-thirds of the way up the sides of the pan.  Use the bottom of a measuring cup to press the crust into place.  Set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                             To make the filling:  Whisk the condensed milk with the lemon juice and set aside.  Whisk the zest with the egg yolks in a medium bowl until pale, 30 to 60 seconds, and then whisk in the lemon juice-condensed milk mixture.                                                                                                                            3                                                                             To make the pie: Place the springform pan on a rimmed baking sheet, pour the mixture into the crust, and carefully transfer the baking sheet to the oven.

Add the vanilla and sift in the confectioners' sugar.  Whip on low speed to combine and then increase the speed to medium-high and whip until medium-stiff peaks form, about 1 1/2 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                             For serving: Before serving, wrap a warm, wet kitchen towel around the edges of the springform pan to release the pie from the pan's sides.

In the bowl of a standing mixer, whisk the flour, yeast, and salt to combine. Attach the bowl and dough hook to the mixer and, with the mixer running on medium-low speed, add first the olive oil, then gradually add the water in a slow steady stream, continuing to mix until the mixture comes together and a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes.2. Lightly spray a large bowl with the nonstick spray oil. Form the dough into a ball, transfer it to the bowl seam-side down, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with the spray and let rise in a warm spot until double in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Make the filling3. Meanwhile, while the dough rises, combine the cheeses, egg yolk, oregano, salt, and black pepper in a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.4. Remove the casing from the sausage. Wash and dry the broccoli rabe and trim the stalks about 1 inch below the leaves, discarding the ends. Cut the broccoli rabe crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Cook the sausage in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and breaking the sausage into 1/2 inch crumbles, until it\u2019s no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds.5. Stir in the broccoli rabe, water, and 1/8 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring constantly, until the broccoli rabe is still slightly crisp but almost tender and the water has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool to room temperature. Once cool, pat dry with paper towels to absorb any excess moisture. (This prevents the calzone from becoming soggy.)6. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position, place a pizza stone on the oven rack, and preheat the oven to 500 \u00b0F (260\u00b0C) for at least 30 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray the parchment lightly with nonstick cooking spray.7. Turn the risen dough out onto an unfloured work surface. Divide the dough in half, and then cut each half into thirds. Gently reshape each piece of dough into a ball. Transfer to the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Let the dough rest at least 15 minutes but no more than 30 minutes. Cut eight 9-inch squares of parchment paper. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time and keeping the other pieces covered, roll the dough into a 9-inch round. Set the dough round onto a parchment square and cover it with another parchment square. Roll out another dough ball, set it on top of first dough round, and cover it with a parchment square. Repeat to form a stack of 3 dough rounds, covering the top round with a parchment square. Form a second stack of 3 rounds with the remaining dough balls and parchment squares.Assemble the calzones8. Remove the top parchment square from the first stack of dough rounds and place the rounds with parchment beneath on the work surface. (If the dough rounds have shrunk, gently roll them out again to 9-inch rounds.)

Then pour everything slowly back into the pot, whisking vigorously as you pour.Bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking all the time, and cook for 5 minutes until the mixture begins to bubble and boil. Boil for two minutes. Do not leave the stove; keep whisking!Remove pot from the heat. Pour in 1 teaspoon vanilla and sprinkle the chopped chocolate on top. With a spatula, gently fold the chocolate into the hot pudding until it is dissolved and the pudding is smooth.Let the pudding cool to lukewarm, whisking it occasionally, then pour it into the pre-baked pie shell. Cover the top with plastic wrap and press down so the wrap is touching the surface of the pudding. Chill for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.In a chilled bowl, combine the remaining 2 cups whole cream, 1 tablespoon espresso powder and 2 tablespoons cocoa. Beat until cream is stiff. Fold in 1 teaspoon vanilla and the maple syrup. Mix well to combine.Remove the plastic wrap from the pudding and heap the espresso whipped cream onto the pie. Mound it up tall. Garnish with espresso beans or chocolate shavings.

Place the first portion on a lightly flour-dusted work surface and return the other to the refrigerator.\u00a0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Use your hands to knead the dough until pliable and form into a small disc. Roll the dough into a \u00bc -inch-thick round. It will be slightly sticky, so you may have to flip and lightly flour it a few times while you work. Use a 2-inch round cookie cutter to create your sandwich tops and bottoms, and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch of space around each cookie. Continue the process with the remaining dough. Extra dough scraps can be refrigerated and rerolled, if desired.\u00a0                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with a little fleur de sel, then bake them for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through the baking time. The tops of the cookies should look a bit dry and possibly cracked. Place the baking sheets on wire racks to cool for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the racks to cool completely before filling them. \u00a0                                                                                                                            8                                                                            To make the vanilla filling: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the shortening and butter until lump free and smooth. Add the sugar in three parts, mixing each part until just combined. Add the salt, vanilla, and rum and beat again for 10 seconds. The filling should be thick but spreadable (like the inside of an Oreo). If it is too thick, add a drop or two of water as needed. Keep adding water to reach the desired consistency, but do not add too much water or the filling will be too thin.\u00a0Alternatively if the mixture is too thin, add a few tablespoons of confectioners\u2019 sugar.\u00a0                                                                                                                            9                                                                            To assemble the Salt-N-Pepper Sandwich Cookies: Use a pastry bag or a small spoon to apply about 2 tablespoons of filling to the flat side of a cookie. Place another cookie, flat side down, on top. Press down slightly so that the filling spreads to the edges of the cookie. Repeat until all the sandwich cookies are made. Let them set up for about 15 minutes before serving.
