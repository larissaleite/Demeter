Add flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse several times to mix. Add butter pieces and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, 6 to 8 one-second pulses.

Add liquid to flour mixture. Stir with a spoon until well incorporated and a sticky dough begins to form. Turn dough out on a very well floured surface, sprinkle the top with flour, and knead lightly until you have a soft, workable dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Butter a 9- by 13-inch glass or metal baking dish and set aside. Cut off 2/3 of the dough and return remaining dough to refrigerator. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with flour then cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out into a rectangle that overlaps the edges of the baking dish by about 2 inches. Lay rolled out dough into the dish, press into the bottom and along the sides.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Add sliced peaches to a large bowl. Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Pour mixture over peaches and toss to coat. Transfer peaches to dough-lined pan. In a small bowl mix together light brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg then sprinkle mixture over peaches. Dot with butter pieces.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Divide remaining dough in half, turn it out on a very well floured surface, sprinkle top lightly with flour then cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out to a large sheet approximately 13 inches long and approximately 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into 4 long strips and arrange evenly across the length of the dish (do not press into the sides yet).  Repeat rolling out process with remaining dough, this time rolling out a wider sheet that's approximately 9 inches long. Cut the dough into 5 strips. Weave the lattice crust together (for a visual guide, check out this Sweet Technique slideshow). Sprinkle crust with remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bake until crust is golden brown and peaches are bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes.

Pat it down with paper towel and season it generously with kosher salt and black pepper.Heat a large 12-inch skillet over medium high heat. Measure and add in a heaping tablespoon of lard {bacon fat or olive oil}. Once the lard is hot sear each side {even the ends} of the pork shoulder for 5-6 minutes or until a nice, dark golden brown crust forms. Remove the seared pork to a nearby cutting board or plate.Reduce the temperature under the pan to medium and add in the diced onions. Stir, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan and cook the onions until they start to turn translucent and golden around the edges. Add in the minced garlic and cook for one minute before transferring the onion/garlic mixture to a clean plate.Measure out the cup of chicken broth and to it add the minced chipotles, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, two tablespoons of honey and the cooked onions and garlic. Stir to combine.Place the pork shoulder in your slow cooker and pour the chipotle/honey broth over top. Cover and set it to high and let it go undisturbed for 4 hours.Using tongs, remove the pork shoulder to a large cutting board. Pour the remaining liquids from the slow cooker into a large bowl. Once the fat has risen to the top, use a large spoon and skim it off the top and discard.Use forks to shred the pork and place it into a bowl and add spoonfuls of the chipotle/ honey broth over top if desired.FOR THE QUESADILLAS:Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Lay down the tortillas and sprinkle evenly with grated Muenster cheese. Top one half of the tortilla with shredded chipotle honey pork and fold the other half over top.

Take moong dal in a pan on low-medium heat.Dry roast it with stirring constantly till it changes the color slightly. As you stir, you will feel the dal gets more crunchy. It will take good 8-10 minutes.Remove it to the plate and let it cool completely.while the roasted dal is cooling, make this yogurt mixture. Take chilled yogurt in a bowl, add red chili powder, cumin powder, black salt and salt.Beat it till yogurt gets smooth and everything gets incorporated well.Also make two chutneys. I have made them a day before and kept in the fridge. You can do the same or make in the morning if serving in the evening.Now dal is cooled to room temperature. grind into the powder using grinder or blender.Add all the spices (red chili, coriander, cumin, amchur, garam masala, fennel powder, salt and sugar). Mix well.Add 1  tablespoons of oil.Mix well so everything is coated with oil. Keep it aside.Now make the dough for the outer layer. Take all purpose flour, whole wheat flour and salt in a bowl. Mix well.Add ghee. Mix it by rubbing the flour and ghee using your fingertips.It should be breadcrumb like texture.Now start adding little water at a time. And make tight and stiff yet smooth dough.Cover it with plastic wrap or cover with another bowl upside down. Let it rest for 15 minutes.After 15 minutes knead the dough one more time and make it smooth.Divide it into 20 equal portions. Roll it into smooth balls and flatten it between your plam.Work with one ball at a time.Roll it into 2 inch diameter circle.Place couple of teaspoons of stuffing mixture in the center.Gather the edges and pinch it. Now press it by your hand gently.It should be sealed properly.Now using the rolling pin again roll it very gently into 2-3 inch diameter kachori. Giver very gentle pressure while rolling. So outer layer does not break. If it breaks and stuffing comes out then it will make mess in the oil while frying.Keep the rolled kachori on the plate on single layer. Keep it covered with kitchen towel. So it does not dry out. Roll all the kachoris similar way.When you are about to done the rolling part. Heat the oil on medium-low heat for frying. Once hot slide the kachori carefully into hot oil. Slightly and gently press into circular motion using spatula.It will puff up. Fry till the bottom is golden brown. There will be no more bubbles. Then flip it.Again fry the other side till crispy and golden brown. Always fry the kachori on medium-low heat to make it crispy. If fried on medium high heat then it will get soft after it cools down.Once fried from both the sides, remove it using the slotted spatula.And put them on paper towel lined plate. Repeat the same for all the kachori. Fry few kachoris at a time, do not overcrowd the pan.Prep all the elements (chopped onion, tomato, two chutneys, yogurt, sev) on the counter or work surface.Take two three kachoris in a plate.Break the top center part only, we will fill the kachori.Add chopped onions.
