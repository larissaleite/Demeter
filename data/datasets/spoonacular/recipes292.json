Keep warm.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Heat remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add onions and bay leaf and cook, stirring often, until onions are brown, about 15 minutes.                                                                                                                              3                                                                            Sprinkle with flour and mix until flour is evenly incorporated with onions. Stirring constantly, slowly pour stock over onion mixture. Bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring often, then lower heat to medium and cook until thickened, about 6 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and keep warm.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Heat vegetable oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium high heat until shimmering.  Reduce heat to medium-low. Place bangers in the skillet and cook until browned on one side, about 5 minutes; flip bangers and cover.  Cook until bangers are fully cooked, about 6 minutes longer.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Divide mash between 4 plates, place 2 bangers on each pile of mash, and top with onion gravy.

Drop the pan from about 4\" above the counter to knock out any bubbles.Bake on the middle oven rack for 50-60 minutes (about 20 minutes for small tins), or until a toothpick comes out clean near the center. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then loosen the cake by knocking it against the counter. Invert the cake onto a serving platter.Stir together lemon glaze ingredients (if needed, heat them briefly to help dissolve the sugar). Brush on the hot cake until all of the glaze is absorbed. After it has cooled, if serving within a day or two continue to final step, or if serving later in the week, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve (keeps 4-5 days wrapped in the fridge).On the day you are ready to serve (or the night before), take the bundt out of the fridge to come up to room temperature. In a bowl, whisk together the icing ingredients, adjusting the cream or confectioners sugar amount to make the icing fairly thick but pourable, not too runny. If the icing is close to the thickness you want, but still a touch too thick to pour, warm it slightly and it will become more fluid until it cools off  (perfect for icing the bundt cake).  Drizzle the icing over the top of the bundt cake and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/happy-birthday-lemon-bundt-cake-for-bountiful-cookbook-589942", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 90, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cookie Monster Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Stir-Fried-Cashew-Pork-490560.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 490560, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Stir-Fried Cashew Pork", "pricePerServing": 274.21, "creditText": "Cookie Monster Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 boneless pork chops (1 pound), trimmed and cut into \u00bd inch strips", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "boneless pork chops", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "trimmed", "cut into \u00bd inch strips"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-chops.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10010062, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 cup cashew halves (unsalted or lightly salted)", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "cashew halves", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "salted", "( or lightly )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cashews.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12087, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh ginger", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "3 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "low sodium soy sauce", "metaInformation": ["low sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 16424, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.5, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "red pepper flakes", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1032009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "rice, for serving", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "rice", "metaInformation": ["for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-uncooked.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20444, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 94.0, "sourceUrl": "http://cookiemonstercooking.com/2013/04/10/stir-fried-cashew-pork/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 15, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, water, soy sauce, red pepper flakes and cornstarch.

With a slotted spoon, transfer the pieces to a paper towel-lined plate.Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet. Increase the heat to medium high, then add the onion, celery, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and soft, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Once the stock is hot, pour the skillet contents over the bread cubes.Let the bread mixture cool for a few minutes until it is no longer hot, then add the mushrooms, prunes, beaten eggs, parsley, and rosemary. The mixture should be very wet, so add additional chicken stock as needed.Transfer the stuffing to a prepared baking dish. Coat a large piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray, then use it to cover the stuffing, spray side down. Bake the stuffing for 20 minutes, remove the foil, then bake for an additional 30-40 minutes, until the top is golden brown and fairly dry. Let cool 10 minutes, then enjoy.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/rosemary-bacon-mushroom-stuffing-688152", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 15, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Baked-Sticky-Orange-Chicken-Drumsticks-535981.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 35, "id": 535981, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Baked Sticky Orange Chicken Drumsticks", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 89.02, "creditText": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 lbs chicken drumsticks (5-6)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken drumsticks", "metaInformation": ["(5-6)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-drumsticks.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 5066, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "kosher salt and ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "low sodium soy sauce", "metaInformation": ["low-sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16424, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup orange marmalade", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "orange marmalade", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-marmalade.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 19303, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "seasoned rice vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1032053, "unit": "tbsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 54.0, "sourceUrl": "http://sarahscucinabella.com/2011/10/12/baked-sticky-orange-chicken-drumsticks/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png", "id": 404765, "name": "aluminum foil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
