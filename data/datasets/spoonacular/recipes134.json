While the mixer is running, add the salt and butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, kneading until the butter is incorporated each time. The dough will be sticky until the butter is fully incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size- about an hour in a warm room. Meanwhile, spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with baking spray. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a rough 8-inch square. Fold the top half to about the middle of the dough and press the edge down to secure it. Fold the top over again, this time to within about an inch or so of the bottom. Press the edge to seal. Now pull the bottom of the dough up to meet the dough roll you've created and seal the seam. Pinch the ends closed and place the dough, seam-side-down, in the prepared loaf pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours before baking.

Mix until just combined.  Don\u2019t over mix.  It\u2019s OK to have some lumps. Pour the batter in the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.  Mine was done by 27 minutes.  If baking cupcakes, check around 13-15th minute. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let it cool for 15 minutes.  Remove the parchment paper on the sides of the pan and slowly invert the pan on a plate and the cake comes out perfect without sticking to the pan. Cool completely before frosting.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/vegan-barley-flour-chocolate-cake-246706", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Laa Loosh", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chicken--Roasted-Red-Pepper--and-Goat-Cheese-Sandwich--8-Points-548590.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 548590, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chicken, Roasted Red Pepper, and Goat Cheese Sandwich \u2013 8 Points", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 276.52, "creditText": "Laa Loosh", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 oz goat cheese, at room temp", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "goat cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/goat-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1159, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 red bell pepper, roasted, de-skinned and sliced into 4 equal parts", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["red", "sliced into 4 equal parts"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11821, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 small red onion, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["red", "small", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 low calorie/high fiber sandwich rolls (I used Trader Joe's Mini Ciabatta Rolls)", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "sandwich rolls", "metaInformation": ["mini", "(I used Trader Joe's Ciabatta Rolls)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/kaiser-roll.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 18353, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1lb cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast, sliced into 4 fillets", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breast", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless", "cooked", "sliced into 4 fillets"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1055062, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1 cup fresh spinach leaves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "spinach leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spinach.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011457, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 96.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.laaloosh.com/2013/03/07/chicken-red-pepper-and-goat-cheese-sandwich/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/toaster.jpg", "id": 404674, "name": "toaster"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Toast rolls in oven or toaster oven until crisp and until edges begin to brown.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Spread 1oz goat cheese onto each roll.
