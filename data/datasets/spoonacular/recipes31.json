Mix thoroughly with a whisk and set aside.In a large skillet set over medium heat, cook the bacon until nice and crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.  Transfer the bacon fat into a small bowl and set aside (leave about a tablespoon in the pan)  Add the onions to the hot bacon fat and cook until soft and caramelized, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic, apricots, mushrooms, salt, black pepper and oregano and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft and tender, about 5 minutes.  Add that to the reserved bacon. Place your skillet back over the heat source, crank the heat to medium-high, add the reserved bacon fat and heat it well. Dredge the liver slices in the arrowroot mixture and shake to remove the excess. Sear the slices on each side for about 30 second per side, just to give them a beautiful dark brown crispy exterior. You might have to work in batches, depending on the size of your skillet. Once the meat is seared on both sides, put it all back in the skillet (if you had to work in batches) add the onions, mushrooms, apricots and bacon plus one cup of water and the vinegar and give everything a quick stir. Bring to a simmer then slowly stir in the other cup of water, then turn the heat down to medium low and let the meat finish cooking, which will take about 5 minutes.Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and mixed greens.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/beef-liver-thatll-make-you-a-believer-its-got-bacon-in-it-551253", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45,

Immediately spray hands with cooking spray, pick up rice krispies mixture and press into one corner of pan.Repeat with remaining marshmallows, butter and rice krispies, alternating colors on second layer. Brush melted chocolate between each section and layer to ensure that cake holds together well (and it tastes great, too)!Place coconut in large resealable plastic bag. Add 8 drops green food coloring, shake bag until color is evenly distributed.Once cake is completely cooled, pull cake out of pan with waxed paper and flip onto a serving plate. Top with second melted chocolate bar, then sprinkle grass over the top of chocolate. Sprinkle desired amount of grass around the sides of cake.Top grass with four chick peeps then add bunny peep (peeps will harden if not covered so you may want to cover the cake with just the four chicks then add the bunny just before serving). Place chocolate malted eggs over grass around side of cake.Cut into pieces when ready to serve and enjoy! Happy Easter!FOR NESTS:For each nest, use 1/2 cup mini-marshmallows, 1 teaspoon butter and 3/4 cup rice krispies and follow step 3 above (leaving out the food coloring unless you want to color your nests). As soon as rice krispies are stirred into marshmallow mixture, press into a lightly greased small bowl (about 3 inches across), preferably with straight sides.

When you are baking pasta in the oven you want to give yourself some cooking leeway, otherwise they will end up a mushy mess. A tasty one, but texture wise it won\u2019t be that appetizing. Once the shells are cooked, drain the water and place the pasta into the baking dish.Chop your bacon up into small pieces and fry up quickly to your desired texture. I prefer my bacon about half-cooked when it\u2019s going into another dish, nothing is worse than chewy raw-hide textured bacon in a smooth, creamy pasta dish. I cook it until most of the fat is gone but it\u2019s still soft. Once that is done, drain the fat and set it aside.Take your chanterelle mushrooms, chop them up coarsely and fry them in a small amount of butter over medium-low heat in a frying pan until most of their water content has been shed. Set aside.Time to make your cheese sauce, which is the base of any white sauce out there, your basic roux. Start with your butter in a pot, and heat it till its melted. Mix in the flour until it\u2019s a gluey mixture. Doesn\u2019t that sound yummy!The secret to a white sauce is patience. Star by adding in a tiny amount of the milk. Mix it in thoroughly. Add in the rest of the milk, little by little, stirring to avoid lumps from forming. Once you have the milk all added, with no flour lumps we hope, add in the cream.Heat the mixture, stirring to avoid scorching the milk and add in your cheese. Let the mixture thicken up and the cheese melt. Add in your salt and pepper.Toss the bacon and chanterelles into the cheese sauce, combine then pour over the pasta shells in your baking dish. Stir to cover the pasta completely then place the lid on top.Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, until the pasta is heated all the way through and the cheese sauce baked.Garnish with your freshly grated Parmesan cheese and chives.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baked-cheesy-bacon-chanterelle-pasta-570464", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 20, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Winter-Apple-and-Dried-Fruit-Pie-195623.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 195623, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Winter Apple and Dried Fruit Pie", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 ounce cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20027, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "8 medium Golden Delicious, Braeburn, or other baking apples peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "golden delicious apple", "metaInformation": ["cored", "medium", "peeled", "sliced into 1/4-inch slices"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-golden-delicious.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 9501, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 ounces granulated sugar (adjust to taste, depending on sweetness of apples and dried fruits)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": ["dried", "to taste", "(adjust , depending on sweetness of apples and fruits)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "10 ounces dried fruits (a combination of dried cherries, chopped dried figs, dried cranberries, currants, raisins)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "neem fruits", "metaInformation": ["dried", "chopped", "(a combination of cherries, figs, cranberries, currants, raisins)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/neem-fruits.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 99145, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon zest from one lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pinch grated nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2025, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 whole egg, lightly beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whole egg", "metaInformation": ["whole", "lightly beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 16.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/winter-apple-pie-dried-fruit-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 52, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.

Reduce the mixer speed and add the flour mixture in 3 parts, slowly blending and scraping the sides of the bowl to include all the dough. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.Roll, bake and top: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Pour enough sugar into a small bowl to dust the cookies (about 1/3 cup).Using a small melon baller or ice scream scoop, make 24 balls of cookie dough and roll each in the sugar to coat on all sides. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart and gently press each down.Bake until the bottoms and edges are browned slightly, about 12 minutes; remove from the oven and immediately push a ginger candy in the center of each cookie so that it cools with it locked in place. Slide the cookies off the sheet by pulling the parchment paper off the sheet and onto a cooling rack. Cool before serving.
