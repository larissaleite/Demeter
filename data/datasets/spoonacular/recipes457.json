Add butter and cut into flour using a pastry cutter or a long pronged for until mixture resembles coarse meal with small visible chunks of butter. Add 1 Tbsp of water at a time and fold with a rubber spatula, while adding just enough water until mixture has almost fully come together and is in moist clumps. Gently press dough together and shape into a 6-inch round disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill 45 - 60 minutes until nearly firm.Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll crust out into a 12-inch round. Fold dough in half then fold in half once more, transfer to a 9-inch pie dish with the folded corner of the dough in the center of the pie pan. Carefully unfold dough and fit into dish. Trim excess crust coming within about 3/4-inch of the pie dish. Tuck that excess under crust and flute or decorate as desired. Pierce bottom and sides of the crust all over with a fork. Transfer to freezer and chill 15 - 20 minutes until firm**. Meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees.Place pie on a baking sheet. Fit two layered sheet of foil snugly against the pie crust (but being careful not to smash decorative edge but still covering loosely), fill with 2 lbs of dry beans (or pie weights, I've also seen granulated sugar used just fill nearly full).
