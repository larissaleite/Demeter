Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet and cool completely, about 20 minutes.Add half of the mushrooms to a food processor and pulse until they are very finely chopped. Remove the finely chopped mushrooms to a bowl and continue with the other half of the mushrooms. Reserve.Heat the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once melted and foaming, add the shallots and sweat until fully softened, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan and saute until they release all their moisture and then dry, about 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until thick, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and parsley. Remove the mushrooms to a small bowl, cool completely and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. The mushrooms should now look like a paste.Combine the Dijon and horseradish in a small bowl. Once the meat is cool to the touch, snip off the butcher's twine and discard, and then spread the mustard and horseradish mixture all over the beef. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.Adjust a rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat until smooth. Dust the work area lightly with flour. Roll out the puff pastry with a rolling pin so it's 4 inches longer than the tenderloin and 6 to 7 inches wider. Brush a 3-inch edge of the pastry with the beaten egg. Spread and pat the mushroom mixture all over the top and sides of the beef. Lay the beef mushroom-side down in the center of the pastry and pat the remaining mushrooms onto the exposed side. Tuck the 2 ends of the pastry into the beef and then fold up the other sides. Place the beef seam-side down on the baking sheet. Brush all over with the egg wash. Cut 3 slits on the top of the roast and sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt.Roast until a thermometer inserted into the beef reads 120 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest for 20 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick pieces. The temperature will rise to 125 degrees F, leaving you with a nice ruby red medium rare.

Using fingertips, rub lard or butter into flour mixture until mixture is crumbly. Work eggs in with fingertips until incorporated, then, gradually add the warm sugar water, adding enough to make a cohesive dough.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Knead the dough on a clean, dry work surface until smooth, 10 to 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Cover dough and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Meanwhile, cover a clean, dry work surface with several clean kitchen towels.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Divide the dough into approximately 1-inch pieces and roll each one into a ball. Using a rolling pin (dough should be smooth but not sticky\u2014flouring the work surface is not necessary), roll each ball into a 6- to 7-inch diameter circle\u2014each bu\u00f1uelo should be thin enough to be translucent.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Arrange the dough circles on the towel-lined surface and let rest 45 minutes. Turn the circles and allow to dry an additional 45 minutes. Dough will feel papery to the touch after the drying period.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Line 2 baking sheets with 2 layers paper towels.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet with high sides over medium-high heat until temperature registers 350\u00b0F. (Oil should be 1- to 1 1/2 inches deep). Fry bu\u00f1uelos 1 to 2 at a time until golden one side, 30 to 60 seconds. Turn over with tongs, and fry until opposite side is golden, 30 to 45 seconds.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Transfer to prepared trays and repeat with remaining dough.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            For the Syrup: Combine piloncillo, brown sugar, or sugar, water, cinnamon, and aniseeds to boil over medium-high heat in medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture is syrupy, 5 to 7 minutes. Strain syrup, discard solids, and drizzle over bu\u00f1uelos or serve alongside.
