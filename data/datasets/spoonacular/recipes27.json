Add 1 cup of the flour and the salt and mix to combine. Gradually add the remaining flour until a soft, smooth dough is formed. Knead for 2-3 minutes. Keep in mind you may not use the full 3 1/2 cups flour (conversely, you may need a bit more). Judge the dough by the texture instead of by an exact amount of flour. It should pull away form the sides of the bowl and form a soft, smooth ball of dough without leaving an overly sticky residue on your fingers. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Lightly grease a large 12X18-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Lightly grease a clean countertop with cooking spray and press the dough into about an 8X18-inch rectangle. Spread the melted butter evenly across the dough. In a small bowl, combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture across the dough and lightly press into the top of the dough. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough into about 1-inch or so widths. As you pick up each breadstick, twist it a few times and place them on the prepared baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. They should all be able to fit on one large 12X18-inch rimmed baking sheet (see image below).Cover the breadsticks lightly with plastic wrap and let them rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes until they are slightly puffy.Bake the breadstick twists for 15 minutes until lightly golden on top. Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until a pourable mixture forms, adding more or milk if needed. Let the breadsticks rest out of the oven for about five minutes before drizzling with the glaze. Serve warm.

"aggregateLikes": 75, "instructions": "Make the vanilla custard1. Pour the milk and cream into a medium saucepan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, then scrape the seeds with the blunt side of a small knife and add them to the pan along with the bean and vanilla extract. Add a 1/2 cup of the sugar and place the pan over medium heat.2. Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon sugar, followed by the salt and cornstarch. When the milk mixture comes to a boil, remove the pan from the heat. Slowly pour some of the mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Add the rest of the hot liquid to the eggs, whisking constantly, then transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and place it over low heat. Keep whisking it to prevent the custard from scorching or overcooking.3. When the custard has thickened somewhat, remove it from the heat and strain it through a chinois or fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water to chill it, whisking occasionally as the custard cools. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the custard in an airtight container until ready to serve.Make the bomboloni4. Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of the granulated sugar and stir to dissolve the yeast. Set the bowl aside and allow the yeast to proof until foamy, about 4 minutes.5. Place the milk in a small saucepan or a microwaveable container and heat until warm to the touch.6. Place the all-purpose flour, cake flour, remaining 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, the salt, and spices in the bowl of an electric mixer and use the paddle attachment to combine them thoroughly. Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the yeast mixture, warm milk, and eggs. Beat on medium until a smooth dough forms. Beat in the butter, then remove the paddle and replace with the dough hook, and beat in enough additional flour on low speed to make a smooth, soft, somewhat elastic dough. Switch to medium speed and mix for 2 to 3 minutes.7. Turn the dough into a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free spot and allow the dough to rise until doubled, about 2 hours.8. Gently deflate the dough by pulling it from the sides of the bowl and turn it onto a floured surface. Pat or roll the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Using a fluted or plain-edged round cutter 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter, cut the doughnuts. Place them on a baking sheet dusted with flour and cover them with plastic wrap. Allow them to proof while you heat the oil.9. Heat 6 inches (4 to 6 cups) olive oil to 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C) in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Fry the doughnuts in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, in the hot oil, gently turning them until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked in the center.10. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels. While they are still warm, sprinkle them generously with confectioners\u2019 sugar on both sides. The bomboloni are best served warm, with Vanilla Custard alongside for dipping.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

tomatoes and their oil in a food processor along with the basil, Parmesan and salt. Process to combine.For the chicken Parmesan: Season the chicken cutlets on both sides with the salt and pepper. Cut them in half crosswise. Using 3 wide, shallow bowls, place the flour in the first bowl, beaten eggs in the second, and combine the panko, Parmesan and oregano in the third.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour to coat lightly, shaking off the excess. Dip the chicken into the egg and then into the panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere the crust to the chicken. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until golden brown on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip all of the chicken over and layer 1 mozzarella slice on top. Cook until the second side is golden brown and the mozzarella has melted, about 4 more minutes.Transfer the chicken to a serving platter, mozzarella-sides up. Spread about 1 tablespoon of Sundried Tomato Pesto on top. Put a tomato slice on 8 of the pieces, and then top them with the remaining 8 pieces, mozzarella sides down, to make little sandwiches.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda onto a piece of parchment or into a large bowl.Beat the butter, brown sugar, peanut butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until the mixture is light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, and add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until just combined.Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely. Invert each onto a cooling rack, and remove the parchment. (The cakes can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 day.)For the filling: Spread the coconut out on a baking sheet, and bake at 350 degrees F until golden and toasted, about 8 minutes.Put the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl, microwave for 1 minute, stir until smooth and pour into a large bowl. Add the cocoa powder, vanilla and salt, and mix with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Continue to mix on low speed, adding the sugar a cup at a time and alternating with additions of the milk. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and mix until smooth. (If not being used immediately, the filling can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days; let it come to room temperature and mix on medium-high until smooth.)To assemble: Slice each cake in half, for a total of 4 rounds. Spread the peanut butter on 3 of the rounds, dividing evenly. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of toasted coconut on each of the 3 rounds. Put 1 round, peanut butter-and-coconut-side up, on a cake stand or serving platter, and spread about 1/2 cup of the chocolate filling on top, leaving about a 1/2-inch border all around. Repeat with 2 more layers of cake and filling. Place the last cake round (without the peanut butter and coconut) on top.For the frosting: Put the remaining 1 1/2 cups of the filling in a large bowl, add the cream and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until medium peaks form. Frost the cake and sprinkle the top with the remaining toasted coconut. Refrigerate the cake until it sets up (this makes it possible to cut neat slices), at least 4 hours up to overnight. Serve chilled or at room temperature.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

By the way if your phyllo pastry was in the freezer, take it out in time for it to defrost. In a large skillet heat the olive oil on medium heat. Add the onions and saute until soft. Add the spinach and salt and pepper and saute until the spinach is limp. Add the lemon juice, and remove off the heat. Let cool.If there is excess liquid, place the mixture in a colander and squeeze out the excess liquid. So make sure the mixture is completely cooled, otherwise it's going to make the phyllo dough soggy, and you don't want soggy spanakopita. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with feta and nutmeg then add this to the spinach mixture and mix until it's all incorporated well together.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and brush 2 baking sheets with some melted butter. Now for handling the phyllo dough, unroll it and lay one sheet flat on your work surface. For the remaining phyllo dough, cover it with a damp towel, so it won't dry out. Brush the sheet with melted butter, then sprinkle some oregano. Now here you can repeat with 2 more sheets or 1 more sheet. I have tried with both and find that if I use 3 sheets, it gets to be too much phyllo for me, so I only repeat with one more sheet, so I have two sheets one on top of the other with melted butter and oregano on both.Using a pizza cutter, cut the sheets lengthwise into 4 long pieces, about 2 inch strips. Place a heaping tsp of the spinach and cheese filling near 1 corner of the phyllo strip. Fold the end at an angle over the filling to form a triangle. Continue to fold the triangle along the strip until you reach the end, like folding a flag. Repeat this with the remaining phyllo and filling. Like I said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty easy to make, just a bit time consuming.Place your spanakopita triangles on your baking sheets and brush with butter, and now you can sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over them if you wish.

Pastry:                                        In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Pulse for a few seconds and then pour into a large mixing bowl.Add the shortening and knead it into the flour with your hands until it is crumbly. Add the milk all at once and mix in with a spatula until it begins to come together. Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop. Knead the dough ball, folding over 10 to 20 times. Using a rolling pin roll the dough to 1/3 to 1/2-inch thickness, then cut into rounds using a 2 1/4-inch ring. Roll each round as thinly as possible or to 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto the dough, brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash, fold over and seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping it into flour as needed. Gently press down to flatten and evenly distribute the filling and snip or cut 3 slits in the top of the pie. Dock pies that are going to be deep-fried, instead of snipping or cutting slits.To pan-fry pies, place a medium saute pan over medium low heat along with 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable, canola oil or butter. Once heated, place 2 to 3 pies at a time into pan and saute until golden on both sides, approximately 3 to 4 minutes per side. Allow to cool 4 to 5 minutes before serving.To deep-fry pies, heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or a large heavy pot to 375 degrees F. Once hot, add 1 to 2 pies at a time and fry until golden brown, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.To bake pies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place finished pies onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.To make toaster pastries:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Divide dough in half and roll out to less than 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 4 inch by 5 inch rectangles. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto center of one piece of dough. Brush the edges with egg wash and top with second piece of dough. Seal edges by pressing together with tine of fork. Gently press down to flatten and evenly distribute the filling and dock the top of the pie. Repeat with second half of dough.Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to cool completely and place into zip-top bags until ready to toast. The pies will not be brown until toasted.                                                Curried Mango Filling:                                        Place all of the ingredients into a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a bowl and place in refrigerator to cool completely before using as filling. For each pie place 1 to 2 tablespoons onto the center of the dough. Follow directions above.Yield: enough for 10 to 15 pies                                                Chocolate Filling:                                        Place the sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and butter into a large zip-top bag and squish to combine. Cut a whole in 1 corner of the bag.For each pie, pipe 1 to 2 tablespoons of mixture onto the center of the dough. Follow directions above.Yield: enough for 10 to 15 pies                                                    Recipe courtesy of Alton Brown, 2005                         CATEGORIES:

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour a standard Bundt pan (12-cup capacity). Sprinkle the chopped walnuts around the bottom; set aside.2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt; set aside.3. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture and the 3 tablespoons of canola oil, and mix on medium-low speed for a minute or two - the mixture should look like wet sand. Add the pudding mix and mix again on medium-low speed until combined.4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, rum, remaining \u00bd cup canola oil, and vanilla extract. Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and beat on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 2 to 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. (The batter will be quite thin - this is good! It will be nice and moist!)5. Pour the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.6. When the cake has about 10 minutes left to bake, start the rum syrup. Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once it is melted, add the sugar and the water. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn off the heat and stir in the rum. Once it is mixed in, return it to medium heat for about 30 seconds.7. When the cake comes out of the oven, immediately pour about one-third of the rum syrup over the bottom of the cake. Pour slowly so it has time to seep into the cake. Let it sit for 5 minutes.8. Invert the cake onto a serving platter. Using a fork or a skewer, poke holes all over the cake - the top, sides, and around the inside. Don't be shy - all of the holes ensure that the rum syrup seeps into the cake evenly. Sloooooowly pour the remaining rum syrup over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. You want to do this step very slowly (it took me almost 15 minutes)  so that the syrup actually seeps into the cake and doesn't just pool on the bottom of the serving dish.9. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature before serving. Leftovers can be kept, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-rum-cake-508097", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Panning The Globe", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/a-trio-of-flourless-almond-cookies-728649.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 16, "id": 728649, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "A Trio of Flourless Almond Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Panning The Globe", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2\u00bd cups almond flour (I used Bob's Red Mill)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond flour", "metaInformation": ["red", "(I used Bob's Mill)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-meal-or-almond-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 93740, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 cups almond meal/flour (I used Bob's Red Mill almond meal/flour)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond meal flour", "metaInformation": ["red", "(I used Bob's Mill almond meal/flour)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-meal-or-almond-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93740, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup bitter sweet mini chocolate chips (I used 365 brand from Whole Foods)", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "bitter sweet chocolate", "metaInformation": ["whole", "mini", "(I used 365 brand from Foods)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19903, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 large egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 egg white", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon ground cardamom", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cardamom", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cardamom.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2006, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be teaspoon ground cinnamon (I use Vietnamese Cinnamon)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": ["(I use Vietnamese Cinnamon)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be teaspoon finely-grated orange zest from one orange -

Once the vegetables have softened and start to brown a little add the tomato paste and mix evenly. Add the ground beef and cook until beef is no longer pink about 10 minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef stock. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook and simmer for another 10 minutes. Mix in peas. Transfer mixture to an oven-proof baking dish and spread evenly. Place potato on top of ground beef mixture and spread out evenly, once the top surface has been covered, rake through with a fork so that there are peaks that will brown nicely. Place the dish into the preheated oven and cook until browned about 20 minutes. Spoon out the shepherd's pie and serve.                                                            Fill a large saucepan with cold water and a tablespoon of salt. Add potatoes to the water and bring to a boil. Let potatoes cook until soft about 20 minutes. Once the potatoes are at a desired density, drain the potatoes and place them back into the saucepan for mashing. Add butter and cream and begin to mash potatoes into a semi smooth consistency. Once at desired texture add cheese and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.

Generously coat the mini muffin pan with cooking spray.Place chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. (Alternatively, see No Microwave? below.) Microwave on High for 1 minute. Stir well, then continue microwaving on Medium, stirring every 20 seconds, until the remaining chocolate melts completely.To prepare filling: Stir together granulated sugar, cream and half the espresso mixture in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High just to steaming, 20 to 40 seconds. (Alternatively, combine in a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just steaming.) Stir until the sugar dissolves. Add corn syrup and half the melted chocolate (reserve the other half for the batter); stir until completely smooth. Cover and transfer to the freezer until cold and firm, about 30 minutes.To prepare batter: When the filling has been chilling for 20 minutes, whisk egg, oil, vanilla, salt and the remaining espresso mixture in a medium bowl until very smooth. Return the remaining chocolate mixture to the microwave. Microwave on Medium, stirring every 20 seconds, until just warm again (do not overheat). In two batches, whisk the egg mixture into the warm chocolate until well blended. Sift confectioners' sugar, flour and cocoa over the batter and whisk in just until smoothly incorporated.To assemble cakes: Remove the filling from the freezer. Spoon half the batter into the mini muffin cups, about 1 rounded teaspoon per cup. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon filling onto the center of each (reserve the rest for the sauce). Divide the remaining batter evenly among the muffin cups, about 1 rounded teaspoon per cake. Smooth out the batter to cover the filling.Bake the cakes on the middle rack until the edges look dry and puffed but the centers still look very underdone and puddinglike, 6 to 9 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack until firm, about 2 minutes. Place a cutting board on top of the pan and invert the mini cakes out onto it. If the cakes are stuck to the pan, run a knife around and under them to loosen.To prepare sauce &amp; serve: Thoroughly stir very hot water into the reserved filling, 1 teaspoon at a time, until very smooth and slightly fluid.

Drain and set aside to cool.Process the oats in the small bowl of a food processor until they're finely chopped\u2014they should be almost the consistency of flour, but not quite. Transfer to a small bowl.Slice 4 ounces of the mushrooms and set them aside. You'll use those later for the gravy. Quarter the remaining mushrooms and pulse them in the food processor until finely chopped.Preheat oven to 375\u00baF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Once the lentils have cooled a bit, put them in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mash them a little bit. You don't want them to be completely mashed; about half of the lentils should still be intact. But mashing them a little bit helps your steaks stick together. Stir in the chopped mushrooms, oats, 1 tablespoon of tamari, ketchup, 1 teaspoon of thyme, Worcestershire sauce, sage, and garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then fold in the egg.Form the steak mixture into 8 small patties, about the size of your palm. Place them on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Once you've shaped all the patties, put them in the oven and bake them for about 25 minutes, until they're browned on the outside and hold together.While the steaks are cooking, start the gravy. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 3 minutes, until just beginning to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook about 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and have released their juices. Pour in the wine and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook until the wine has just about evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of tamari, the remaining teaspoon of thyme, and the mushroom or vegetable stock. Once the stock comes to a boil, let the gravy cook down for about 8 minutes, until it's reduced and thickened slightly, stirring occasionally.Whisk the flour and 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Pour this mixture into the gravy and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, until the gravy has thickened. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. The gravy will thicken as it cools.

In a glass liquid measure or a microwave-safe bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk and the chocolate. Microwave for one minute and stir. If not completely melted and smooth, microwave for an additional 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Whisk in the evaporated milk and heavy cream (or half-and-half). The mixture will start out very, very thick. Don't worry! It will thin out as you whisk in the other milks.Slowly pour or ladle spoonfuls of the chocolate mixture over the top of the cake. Let the liquid absorb before adding more. Ladle the liquid onto the cake until all the chocolate mixture has been used. It's ok if there is excess liquid pooled on top of the cake, it should absorb into the cake while it is refrigerated.Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Stir together the soy sauce and mushroom powder in a small bowl and set aside.Add the cream, garlic and thyme sprigs to a medium pot and set over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, cover and remove from the heat. Let stand 15 to 30 minutes.Remove the garlic and thyme from the cream, then whisk in the creme fraiche, nutmeg and soy-mushroom mixture until well incorporated; season with salt and pepper.Assemble the gratin by putting half of the potatoes in a single overlapping layer in the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Coat with half of the cream mixture and sprinkle on 1 cup of the Gruyere. Repeat with the remaining potato slices, cream mixture and 1 cup Gruyere. Cover with foil and transfer the dish to a baking sheet.Bake until the potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the top is golden brown and bubbling, 30 minutes. Let sit 30 minutes before serving.                                                            If you can't find porcini powder, you can pulverize dried porcini mushrooms in your food processor or spice grinder; or try other dried mushrooms here.

Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Sometimes I work in a few more sprinkles of flour if the dough is sticky. This amount of dough yielded 2 pizza crusts for my 12-inch cast iron skillet. If you're using an 8-inch, you may get 3 doughs, but you also may just want to stick with 2 thicker doughs. Divide the dough evenly in half (or thirds). Place one dough on a well-floured pizza peel and roll into a round about the size of your skillet.pizza + the skillet methodHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the beef with the salt, pepper and onion powder, then add to the skillet and cook until browned, using a wooden spoon to bread the beef into small crumbles, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain any liquid from the skillet. Combine the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl and mix until combined. Note that this sauce makes enough for two pizzas, so use half on each. Remember, the dough MUST be on a well-floured pizza peel (or surface) so you can simply slide the entire thing into the skillet. Spread half of the sauce onto the dough and cover it with a sprinkling of cheddar. Add half of the beef on top, then add another handful of cheese and the bacon. The bacon should only be slightly cooked so it doesn't burn in the oven. Place an oven rack directly under your broiler and preheat your broiler to the highest setting. Additionally, place your cast iron skillet on the stovetop burner, turning the heat on high. You want to heat the skillet for 10 minutes. If it begins to smoke a lot, you can reduce the heat a bit. But you want it HOT.Place a potholder or thick towel on the handle of the skillet (it will be sooo hot). Carefully slide the pizza into the skillet, dough side down. Don't worry if a few toppings or pieces of cheese slice onto the surface - it will be totally fine. After about 30 seconds, turn off the burner, grab the skillet and pop it in the oven, right under the broiler. Broil for 1 minute, then using the potholder, grab the handle and rotate 180 degrees, broiling for only 1 more minute. Remove immediately and place on the stovetop. Let cool slightly for about 5 minutes, then use a large spatula to remove the pizza.
