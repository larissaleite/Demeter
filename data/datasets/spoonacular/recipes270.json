Fit the mixer with the dough hook, add the remaining flour, and knead at medium speed until the dough is smooth and doesn\u2019t stick to the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. Lightly grease a large bowl. Shape the dough into a round and place in the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.For the icing:While the dough rises, place the cream cheese, corn syrup, cream, sugar, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed until combined. Increase speed to high and beat until the icing is smooth with no lumps, about 2 minutes. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until ready to use. Make ahead: icing can be made up to 5 days ahead of time and kept in an airtight container in the fridge.To shape and fill the dough:Once risen, press down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to shape into a 16x2-inch rectangle, long side facing you. Brush all over with melted butter.Combine all the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the far edge. Roll the dough up, pinching with your fingers to keep it tightly rolled. Arrange on the work surface so the seam side is down. Lightly flour the roll. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish or two 9-inch cake pans. Cut the roll into 12 equal pieces using a sharp knife (see video for how to do this). Place the rolls cut side up in the prepared baking dish(s). Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Make ahead: place the shaped but unrisen rolls in the prepared baking dishes, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove from fridge at least one hour before baking and place in a warm spot to let the dough come to room temperature and get puffy. Bake as directed. You can also FREEZE the covered unrisen shaped rolls for up to 3 months. Thaw them to room temperature either overnight in the fridge or for several hours on the counter then allow the rolls to double in size before baking as directed.Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake the rolls until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Make ahead: At this point you can allow the rolls to cool to room temperature then store, covered, in the freezer until ready to eat. Thaw them overnight in the refrigerator then reheat in a 350\u00b0F oven for about 10 minutes, or until hot.Use a spatula to spread the icing all over.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the half-and-half and 6 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once up to a boil, stir in the grits. Bring it back up to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture has slightly thickened (it should resemble cooked oatmeal in thickness), 10 to 15 minutes. Use a whisk to break up any lumps that have formed.Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until just turning crispy, about 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel, patting it to remove any excess fat. Using the same saucepan, add the onions to the leftover bacon drippings and saute until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the collard greens and the remaining 2 cups chicken stock and cook until tender, another 10 minutes. Drain the collards and onions in a colander.Once the grits are done, add the Parmesan, butter, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup of the Monterey jack. Stir until the butter has melted and all the ingredients are well combined. Then add the drained collards mixture and stir.Transfer the grits mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with the crumbled bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup Monterey jack. Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

In your mixer with whisk attachment,whisk yolks and sugar on high for 5 minutes. It should be creamy and light yellow. Lower speed to medium. Add the cooled espresso, rum and marscapone.2. In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients of the Espresso Syrup together. Set up your assembly line - from left to right:Ladyfingers - Espresso Syrup - Pan/Indiv Cups - mascarpone CremeQuickly dip the ladyfinger in the Espresso Syrup - a 2-second dip is all that you need. If you dip too long, too much of the syrup gets absorbed and the ladyfinger will get too soggy to lift out of the bowl. The ladyfinger should still be a little hard - don't worry, they will all soften up in the refrigerator. Line the dipped ladyfingers on the bottom of the pan/cups). Follow this with another layer of dipped ladyfingers. Finish with remaining mascarpone Cream. Sprinkle chocolate shavings on top.
