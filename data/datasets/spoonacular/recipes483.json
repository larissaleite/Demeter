Then in an additional separate bowl, stir together buttermilk and coffee. Add dry ingredients to creamed butter mixture alternately with buttermilk and coffee, beating well after each addition.Line baking pans with about 24 paper baking cups, and fill each two-thirds full with batter. (Here is my tutorial for filling cupcake liners.) Bake at 375\u00b0 for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.Once the cupcakes have reached room temperature, use a melon baller (or a small spoon) to scoop out a small portion from the middle of the cupcake (about 1 teaspoon). Fill the empty space with a teaspoon or so of Nutella. Then top the cupcakes with the Nutella frosting (recipe instructions below.)Using an electric mixer, cream butter and Nutella together on medium-speed until smooth. Add in vanilla and beat until smooth. Reduce speed to low and gradually add powdered sugar until incorporated.

In a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight fitting lid, combine 2 cups of water with the rice over high heat. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Let the rice cook for about 12 to 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit with the lid on for 5 minutes and for as long as 30 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff it with a fork.To steam the broccolini fill a pot with a few inches of water then insert a steamer basket over the top. Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the steamer basket. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the broccolini and cover. steam for 5 minutes or until tender.Remove the plastic wrap from the casserole dish and place in the oven. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes. Chicken thighs are quick to cook, but if after 20 minutes they are not crispy on the outside and you prefer them crispier, turn the broiler on and broil for about 2 to 3 minutes, keeping an eye on them to not burn.Serve the chicken thighs over the cooked rice and with broccolini on the side. There will be drippings left over from cooking the thighs, so just spoon that over the chicken and rice.

Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).                                                                                            Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.                                                                                           Sprinkle cornmeal over two 12-in. pizza pans coated with cooking spray. Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to prepared pans. Build up edges slightly. Prick dough thoroughly with a fork; brush with oil. Bake at 425\u00b0 for 5-8 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.                                                                                           In a small saucepan, saute garlic in butter until tender. Stir in the parsley, pepper and remaining salt. Combine flour and milk until smooth. Stir into pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.                                                                                           Spread over crusts; top with chicken, tomatoes, spinach, cheeses and Italian seasoning. Bake 10-12 minutes longer or until crusts are lightly browned and cheeses are melted.                                        Yield: 2 pizzas (6 slices each).

Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the pureed sweet potatoes, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and sweet potatoes, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners. Fill about  full, using about  cup of batter per cup. Tip: Avoid over-filling the liners which may cause the batter to run-over the sides when baking.

Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the granulated sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 5 minutes to add all of the sugar, then add the brown sugar, taking an additional 3 to 4 minutes, beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugars, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Add the vanilla along with the last egg. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the pureed sweet potatoes, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and sweet potatoes, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners.
