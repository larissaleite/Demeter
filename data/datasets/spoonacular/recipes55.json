powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 to 6 times to combine. Add the butter and pulse another 4 to 5 times until the mixture starts to look like sandy, pea-sized gravel. Add the egg and egg yolk, then sprinkle 3 tablespoons water evenly over the top of the dough. Pulse a few times until the mixture just starts to clump together and form a ball.2 Chill the crust: Turn the pastry dough out onto a cutting board and use your hands to shape it into a chubby disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to three days.3 Roll out the crust: When ready to bake the tart, lay a sheet of parchment on your counter or other flat surface and sprinkle with arrowroot or tapioca starch. Place the chilled pie dough in the center of the parchment and roll into a circle about 12 inches in diameter.4 Transfer the crust to the tart pan: Flip your tart pan upside down and place it in the center of the rolled out pastry dough. There should be at least 1 1/2 inches of pie dough showing around the edge. Carefully, slide one hand palm side up under the parchment and place the other hand on the tart pan. Quickly, and with great confidence, flip the whole thing over.Gently ease the crust into the tart dish and press it into the corners. Peel back the parchment and discard. Your pastry dough may break, but just press the cracks back together if it does. Use a paring knife to trim away the excess dough and then prick the bottom of the tart all over with the tines of a fork.  5 Place the tart shell in the freezer to chill while you prepare the apples.6 Preheat oven to 350F.7 Prepare the apples. Peel the apples and halve them lengthwise. Use a melon baller, paring knife, or small spoon to remove the core, seeds, and stem. Slice the apples very thinly (ideally 1/8-inch thick) using a chef's knife or mandoline.  8 Prepare the glaze: In a small saucepan, melt butter (or other fat) with the sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla over medium heat. Whisk to combine while bringing to a simmer. Keep whisking until all sugar is dissolved.9 Assemble the tart: Find a few of your thinnest apple slices and set them aside. Remove the tart shell from the freezer and begin laying the apple slices in concentric circles, starting from the outer edge of the crust and spiraling inward.When you get to the center, take your thinnest apple slices and fold them gently to form the center of the pattern. (You might have some apple slices leftover.)Sprinkle the lemon zest evenly over the tart. Drizzle about half of the glaze evenly over the tart. (I dipped a pastry brush in the glaze and let it drip onto onto the apples.)   10 Bake the tart for 40 minutes, turning the pan halfway through baking.11 Brush the rest of the glaze over the apple slices. Return to the oven and bake for 5 more minutes.12 Serve warm or at room temperature.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/apple-tart-paleo-gluten-free-828637", "vegetarian": true,

Place jalapeno on a baking sheet under the broiler and continue to turn while cooking until blackened completely.  Remove and place in a zippered plastic bag.  Set aside for 15 minutes.  {Start the rest of the recipe}.  After 15 minutes remove the chile, wipe off the blackened skin.  Remove stem and seeds, and dice the chile.  Wash hands thoroughly!Pour frying oil into a pot for a depth of 2 inches.  Using a candy thermometer to measure the oil temperature, bring oil to 375 degrees.  {While oil heats batter can be constructed}.In a large bowl combine all the dry ingredients:  corn flour (masa harina), flour, baking powder, salt, sugar.  Mix until fully combine.Add egg, jalapeno, Tabasco and \u00bd cup of buttermilk to the dry mixture.  Stir by hand to combine.  The batter should resemble pancake batter.  If it is too thick, it is hard to coat the hotdogs; too thin and it won\u2019t easily cover the hot dogs fully.  If the batter is too thick with only \u00bd cup buttermilk, add more, small amounts at a time stirring fully to reach desired consistency.  Note: I noticed as the batter sat while I dipped and cooked the corn dogs, it became thicker so I added more buttermilk through the process to ensure a good consistency of batter to work with.Dab any excess moisture from the hot dogs with a paper towel.  Lightly dust with cornstarch which assists the batter to stick to the hot dog.Place a hot dog on a bamboo skewer, only inserting the skewer enough to dip the hot dog; it will be removed when frying to if it is inserted too deeply removal is difficult.  Place the hot dog in the batter and roll it to cover all sides.  An alternative method is to pour the batter in a small drinking glass (larger than the hot dog) and dip the hot dog into the batter.Place a cooling rack over a baking sheet or paper towels.  Place the hot dog into the heated oil, remove the skewer and allow to cook until golden brown about 1 \u00bd-2 minutes.  Remove with a heat-proof slotted spoon and place on the cooling rack.

Add the bananas, pecans and cinnamon, turning them gently until the liquid coats the bananas and pecans. Carefully pour the rum into the pan, let it heat slightly and then ignite. If you are using a gas stove, simply tilting the pan so that the rum is at the edge without spilling should ignite the rum. On an electric stove, you will need to use matches. Fireplace matches are best since they are long and reduce the chance of burning your hand. Once the flames have died, remove the pan from the heat.3.

high, heat 1 teaspoon of butter and the one tablespoon of olive oil to hot.Add mushrooms and saut on high for two minutes. Reduce to medium high and add whole fresh thyme and whole fresh rosemary and push them to the bottom. Add salt and pepper. Continue to cook until mushrooms are browned, about three more minutes.Add wine to deglaze and cook until no liquid is left.Add stock and cook to reduce to less than half. (Should only be a few tablespoons of liquid left).Remove from heat and stir in remaining butter to thicken sauce. If the sauce is too loose, mix a tiny bit of corn starch with a few drops of water and add to the sauce over heat. Set sauce aside off heat.Heat a ribbed pan over high heat.While pan is heating, dry steaks again and brush on olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat for the other side.Once pan is smoking hot, add steaks and do not touch for two minutes. Turn steaks 180 degrees on same side so that cross marks will appear on steaks. Cook for 1  more minutes (total 3  minutes on one side).Flip and cook for one minute, then turn the heat to low, Keep steaks on that side and loosely tent pan with foil and cook on low for about 5 minutes or until a probe thermometer inserted into center returns a temperature of 125 degrees for medium rare. Or cook longer for your preference of doneness.If the steaks are not exactly the same thickness, pull the thinner steak off sooner than the other. Our steaks were slightly different in thickness. One was done in nine minutes and one in ten minutes.Let them rest on a plate tented for a few minutes.Heat the already prepared Parsnip and Celery Root Pure either on the stove or in the microwave.Add  cup water to the steak pan and deglaze to a single tablespoon and add that to the wine sauce along with any juice in the dish with the steaks.

For the cookies, in a large bowl sift together the flour, salt, fleur de sel, white pepper and cocoa powder. Set aside.2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla and melted chocolate and beat until well-combined. Scrape down the bowl and beat again for 10 seconds.3. Add half of the dry ingredients and beat for 15 seconds. Scrape down the bowl and add the remaining dry ingredients. Beat until just incorporated.4. Loosely shape the dough into two balls. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and then refrigerate them for at least 3 hours.5. Preheat the oven to 350. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.6. Unwrap one ball of dough and divide it into two equal portions. Place the first portion on a lightly floured work surface and return the other to the fridge.7. Use your hands to knead the dough until it is pliable and form it into a small disc. Roll the dough so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Add flour as necessary to prevent it from sticking. Use a 2-inch round cookie cutter to create the sandwich tops and bottoms. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch of space between them. Continue with the remaining dough, rerolling dough as necessary until it is all used up.8. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with a little fleur de sel and then bake them for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through. Place the baking sheets on wire racks to cool for 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies to the racks to cool completely before filling them.9. For the vanilla filling, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the shortening and butter until smooth. Add the sugar in three parts, mixing each until just combined. Add the salt, vanilla, and rum. Beat again for 10 seconds.10. To assemble the sandwich cookies, use a pastry bag to apply about 2 tablespoons of filling to the flat side of a cookie. Place another cookie, flat side down, on top. Press down slightly so that the filling spreads to the edges of the cookie. Repeat until all the sandwich cookies are made. Let set up for about 15 minutes before serving.

Add the cranberries and let them cook until they just start to burst. Remove them from the heat and let them cool in the syrup in the refrigerator until ready to use. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0    Tear croissants into 1 inch pieces and place them on a sheet pan; put them in the oven for 8-10 minutes until golden brown and dry.    Scrap the seeds from the vanilla bean and mix with 2 cups heavy cream, 6 eggs yolks and brown sugar. Whisk until thoroughly combined.    Butter a round souffle or rectangular casserole dish and scatter the bread cubes over the bottom; sprinkle with the dried cranberries.    Pour the vanilla bean custard evenly over the croissants and berries and place the dish in a deep pan. I used my turkey roaster for this. Fill the pan with warm water halfway up the sides of the souffle dish.    Cover the large pan with aluminum foil and bake in the oven at 350\u00b0 for 40-60 minutes depending on the size of your dish.About 10 minutes before the bread pudding is finished, make the zabaglione.    Using a double boiler fill with water but do not let the water touch the bottom of the insert and heat on high.    Whisk 3 egg yolks, 1/3 cup sugar & champagne in the pan.

servingsIngredients2 tablespoons of olive oil1/2 of a large onion, chopped2 tablespoons of chopped jalapeno1 pound of ground beef1 teaspoon of kosher salt8 turns of the pepper grinder1 tablespoon of chili powder1/2 teaspoon of cumin1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder1/4 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning (like Slap Ya Mama), optional1/2 teaspoon oregano1 packet of Sazon seasoning, optional1 cup of beef stock1 cup of red salsa1 (4 ounce) can of green chilies, undrained1 can pinto beans4 small flour tortillas, cut into small squares1 cup of shredded cheddar or Mexican style cheeseSour cream1 green onion, slicedOptional garnishes: Shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped avocados, or other toppings as desiredInstructionsHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium skillet; add the onion and jalapeno; cook until onion is soft but not browned. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up with a potato masher, until browned. Drain if needed.Add the salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, oregano, and Sazon. Stir together and continue cooking for about 1 minute. Add the beef stock and stir. Add the salsa, green chilies and pinto beans; stir and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes.Stir in the pieces of tortillas and sprinkle cheese on top. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle top with sliced green onion. Garnish individual servings with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, avocado, sour cream or other burrito toppings as desired.~Cook's Notes~I used a Sam's brand of lime and garlic salsa from Walmart, but any salsa will do, so just use whatever you usually buy. If you don't use Sazon seasoning for anything else, don't buy it, just substitute a general seasoning salt, like Lawrys.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/beef-and-bean-burrito-skillet-dinner-244312", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Brown-butter-sole-with-peas---mussels-225812.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 225812, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Brown butter sole with peas & mussels", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "50g butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "small 1 tablespoon dry cider (about 2 tbsp)", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry cider", "metaInformation": ["dry", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93807, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "200g fresh podded peas (or frozen)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh peas", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "frozen", "podded", "(or )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 200.0, "id": 11304, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "juice \u00bd lemon, plus wedges to serve", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 lemon sole fillets", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "lemon sole", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sole.jpg", "unitLong": "fillets", "unitShort": "fillet", "amount": 4.0, "id": 10015028, "unit": "fillet"}, {"originalString": "100g mussels, washed and de-bearded", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "mussels", "metaInformation": ["washed and de-bearded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mussels.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 15164, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "large handful pea shoots, to serve", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "pea shoots", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/snow-pea-sprouts-or-pea-shoots.png", "unitLong": "handful", "unitShort": "handful", "amount": 1.0, "id": 98945, "unit": "handful"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp sunflower oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "sunflower oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4584, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 90.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3077684/brown-butter-sole-with-peas-and-mussels", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "aggregateLikes": 197, "instructions": "Heat the oil and butter in a deep fryingpan until foaming.

                                                          For the Roasted Mushrooms: Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Toss mushrooms with olive oil, garlic, lime juice, and salt in medium-sized bowl. Dump into 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil. Place in oven and cook for 10 minutes.

Add garlic and cook until it just begins to brown, about one minute. Dump in beans and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, and then mash beans with potato masher or back of a large spoon. Keep mashing until they look like mashed potatoes, about 10 minutes.

Spread one ounce of goat cheese on cut side of each top half. Spread two tablespoons of refried beans on cut side of each bottom half.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Divide mushrooms between each bottom half. Place bottom halves on baking sheet and place in oven. Warm them for five minutes. Remove from oven, top each with a handful of arugula, a drizzle of salsa, and top half of roll. Return to baking sheet, and again transfer to oven. Warm for just two minutes.

Heat for 10 minutes, making sure you stir ingredients every few minutes.In a large, heavy pot, heat 2-inches of the peanut oil to 325 degrees F.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the water and whisk until smooth. Let the batter stand for 15 minutes.In a wide, shallow bowl, toss the coconut and bread crumbs together.Put the shrimp into the batter. Remove the shrimp, 1 at a time, and dredge in the coconut mixture, pressing to help the coconut adhere. Fry the shrimp in batches in the hot oil for 1 to 2 minutes or until brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.  Serve the shrimp with the dipping sauce.

   For the Cake: Move the oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. Grease and flour a 9-by 9-inch baking dish and set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter on medium speed until light and soft, about 3 minutes. Add sugar gradually, then add the egg, mixing until just combined, about 15 seconds. Reduce speed to low, then with machine running, alternately add milk and flour mixture, in three batches, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary, until fully incorporated. Stir in vanilla and pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake until the top of the cake is a light golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool at least 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the Sauce: Wipe out stand mixer bowl. Cream the butter on medium speed until light and soft, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add sugar gradually. Slowly stir in the brandy. Add the yolks and cream, beating until just combined. Transfer mixture to a double boiler and cook over hot water whisking constantly until light and smooth, 7 to 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Remove brandy mixture from heat. Carefully clean stand mixer bowl and attach whisk head. Beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Pour brandy mixture over egg whites then quickly whisk together. Using a wooden skewer, poke 50 to 60 holes in the surface of the cake, then slice to serve. Pour the sauce over the cake and serve immediately.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cottage-pudding-with-brandy-caramel-sauce-202787", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,
