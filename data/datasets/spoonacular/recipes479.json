Be sure to rinse the blender soon afterwards, as the achiote stains.  Cut the pork into chunks of about 2 inches square. Don\u2019t trim the fat, as you will need it in the braising to come. You can always pick it out later.   Put the pork in a non-reactive (glass, stainless steel or plastic) container, then pour over the marinade mixture. Mix well, cover and keep in the fridge for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.2 Cooking this takes 3-4 hours, so plan ahead. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line a large casserole with a double layer of heavy-duty foil, or a triple layer of regular foil \u2013 you want a good seal. (Traditionally, cochinita pibil is wrapped in banana leaves, which add a wonderful flavor to the pibil. So, if banana leaves are available\u2014you may be able to get them at the same store as the achiote paste, or at an Asian market\u2014consider using them. Just heat the leaves first to make them more pliable.)  Pour in the pork and the marinade and close the foil tightly. Put the casserole in the oven and bake for at least 3 hours.

Add the water, bay leaves, thyme, and salt.Raise the heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, cover, and let cook for 20 to 25 minutes, until the farro is cooked through.3 While the farro is cooking, prep the swiss chard and radicchio.4 Once the farro is done, remove the lid and check the moisture level. If there is still water in the pot, increase the heat to high to make it boil away. Then scoop out the farro onto a sheet pan to cool. At this point you can either remove the garlic cloves and discard, or keep them with the farro if you love garlic. Remove the bay leaves. 5 In the same pan that you've used to cook the farro, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the swiss chard to the pan and toss to coat with the olive oil. Cook for a minute or two until the chard just begins to wilt. Then add the radicchio to the pot, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and the rosemary leaves, and toss to combine. Cook for a few minutes until the radicchio is wilted.
