Just mince up what you have in the fridge!Preheat the grill or grill pan.Separate the meat into 4 \u2013 2 oz portions and form them into thin patties.In a small bowl add the cheese, pepper, onion, chives and zucchini.Mash everything together with the back of spoon.Smear half of the cheese and vegetable mixture on one of the patties.Top with another patty and seal the edges.Repeat for the other burger.Grill 4-5 minutes a side.Do NOT squish the burger while cooking. You shouldn\u2019t anyway but with cheese in the middle it\u2019s especially important. :)I served mine on an Whole Wheat English Muffin with a bed of spinach leaves.Looks like a regular burger until\u2026Ohh yea! vegetable cheesy goodness!!Note: Ketchup was NOT needed. That\u2019s how much flavor the cheese added. You guys know how much I love ketchup too. I forgot to add it for the photo and then took a bite, didn\u2019t even notice it wasn\u2019t on there!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cheesy-garden-vegetable-burger-506302", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Dinner-Tonight--Sauteed-Pork-Chops-with-Sauerkraut-206899.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 206899, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Dinner Tonight: Sauteed Pork Chops with Sauerkraut", "pricePerServing": 225.34, "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup apple juice", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "apple juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9016, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 slices of bacon, chopped", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10123, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "caraway seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/caraway-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2005, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh dill", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2045, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 onion, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 pork chops, about 1-inch-thick", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "pork chops", "metaInformation": ["1-inch-thick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-chops.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 10010062, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Salt and pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "3 cups sauerkraut, rinsed and drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "sauerkraut", "metaInformation": ["rinsed", "drained"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sauerkraut.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11439, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 72.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/sauteed-pork-chops-with-sauerkraut-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "1", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}], "step": "Add the chopped bacon to a heavy saucepan set over medium heat.

Chicken Pot Pie:                                        For the chicken: Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes, and then remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly.Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. For the stock, return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard.For the pot pie: When you're ready to use the Thyme Pastry, remove from the freezer and allow it to sit on the counter to thaw slightly, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Begin by finely dicing the vegetables. Slice the celery stalks into narrow strips, then slice in the other direction to create a fine dice. Repeat this process with the carrots, and the onion.Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery.

Sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables and chicken, and stir to combine. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring gently.Pour in the chicken broth, stirring constantly. Stir in the bouillon cube and wine if using. The flour will combine with the chicken to create a delicious gravy. Next, add the peas.Pour in the cream and stir.

Be sure it's adequately salted!Pour the chicken mixture into a deep pie pan or small casserole dish.Roll out the pastry so that it's 1 inch larger than the pan.

Cool for 10 minutes before serving.To freeze: Allow the filling to cool completely then top with the crust. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place in the freezer.To cook from frozen: Remove the pot pie from the freezer, brush with egg wash (1 egg mixed with 2 tablespoons water or cream) and place directly in a 375-degree F oven. Bake until lightly browned and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes.                                                Thyme Pastry:                                        For the thyme pastry: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
