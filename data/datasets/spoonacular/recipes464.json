Remove the sausage to a cutting board and slice into medallions. Return the sliced sausage to the skillet and continue cooking until the sausage is browned on all sides.Thinly slice the bell peppers and cut the mozzarella into small cubes.Add the cooled and drained pasta to a large bowl along with the arugula, sliced peppers, cheese cubes, and cooked sausage.
