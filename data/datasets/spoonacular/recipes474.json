To char your corn place the ears of corn directly on separate gas stovetop burners or if you do not have a gas stove top char the corn under the broiler. Char the corn for about 1 minute \"per side\". The corn in going to pop and crackle, trust me it is going to to be loud. Once the corn is lightly charred all over, remove from the burner (or broiler) and set aside to cool.In the bowl of a food processor or blender. Add the flour, milk, water, eggs and a pinch if salt and pepper. Now go and scrape the kernels off both ears of corn using a sharp knife. Add half of the kernels to the food processor and reserve the remaining kernels for the enchilada filling. Process until almost completely smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours. I made the filling for the crepechiladas during this time.Heat a 12 inch non-stick pan. Add butter or cooking spray (I like to use cooking spray) to coat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. Makes about 12 crepes.To make the crepechiladas, heat a medium size skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion and saut about five minutes or until soft. Add the jalapeo and garlic and saut another 5 to 10 minutes or until they are soft and caramelized.Meanwhile add the hatch chili enchilada sauce and avocado to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Add the cilantro, adobo sauce, chili powder, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper. Process again until the cilantro is throughly chopped. Once the onions, jalapeos and garlic are done add them to the food processor and process 30 seconds or until everything is evenly distributed.Add the chicken to a large bowl and pour about 1/3 of the sauce into the bowl. Add the remaining charred corn from earlier, half the pepper jack cheese and half the cheddar cheese. Mix to combine.Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and then spread about 1/3 of the hatch chili enchilada sauce in bottom of the dish.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Working with one crepe at a time spoon about 1/4 cup filling onto 1/3 of the crepe and then roll the crepe up and place seam side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining crepes until all the filling has been used. I made 9 crepechiladas.Spoon the remaining hatch chile sauce over the middle of the crepes and then top with the remaining cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 15-20 minutes, then remove the foil and bake 10 more minutes.Serve with fresh slices of avocado, cilantro and chopped tomatoes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creamy-avocado-+-hatch-chile-chicken-charrd-corn-crepechiladas-549696", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Recipe Girl", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grilled-Swordfish-w--Rosemary-517040.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 517040, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Grilled Swordfish w/ Rosemary", "preparationMinutes": 20, "pricePerServing": 311.36, "creditText": "Recipe Girl", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup dry white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14106, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary, divided", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh rosemary", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "divided", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2063, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "5 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "Tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 Tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoon", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "rosemary", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg", "unitLong": "sprig", "unitShort": "sprigs", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2036, "unit": "sprigs"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 (4-ounce) swordfish steaks", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "swordfish steaks", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/swordfish.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 15110, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 70.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.recipegirl.com/2008/10/04/grilled-swordfish-with-rosemary/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg", "id": 404646, "name": "baking pan"}], "step": "Combine wine, garlic, and 1 teaspoon rosemary in an 8-inch square baking dish.

Season the lamb with salt and pepper, add to the pot, and cook until deeply browned, about 5 minutes on each side.  Stir in the onions and garlic, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.                            Pour the wine into the pot, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, lamb stock, lemon zest and juice, oregano, cinnamon, and bay leaf.  Bring back to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lamb is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Stir in the green beans and cook until they are tender, about 20 additional minutes.                            Remove the bay leaf and any bones from the stew.  Garnish stew with chopped fresh parsley.
