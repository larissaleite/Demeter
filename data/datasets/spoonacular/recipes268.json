Add the eggs, cornichons, pickle juice, and the plumped dried fruits along with any liquid with them; mix very well.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Pack the terrine mixture into a deep 9 by 5-inch (23 by 13cm) loaf pan (see Note below). Cut a piece of parchment paper large enough to fit over the top, then seal the top of the pan with aluminum foil. Set the loaf pan in a larger baking dish and add enough very hot water to reach a little over halfway up the outside of the loaf pan.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Bake for about 11/2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer stuck in the center registers 160\u00baF (71\u00baC). Remove from the oven. Lift the terrine out of the water bath and carefully pour out the hot water. Place the terrine back in the larger dish and put a brick (or another flat, heavy object) on the foil on top of the terrine and let cool to room temperature. During the cooling, any juice that overflows should be collected and chilled; a dab of the jelly makes an excellent accompaniment when serving.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Once cool, refrigerate the terrine for 2 days before serving, to allow the terrine to season. Slice it directly from the pan. It may crumble a bit, as it\u2019s a country-style (chunky) terrine. It can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. I don\u2019t recommend freezing because it changes the texture of the terrine.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Note: This terrine mixture will fit into a loaf pan that has a 2 1/2-quart (2.5l) capacity, or you can bake it in any kind of deep mold that you wish; those made of metal, glass, earthenware, or ceramic will work well.

Spray a pie plate with cooking spray. Make the batter; pour into the pie plate until three-quarters full. Bake until set around the edges but slightly wobbly in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.Meanwhile, make the strawberry filling: Toss the strawberries, granulated sugar and salt in a bowl. Let sit 20 minutes.Unroll 1 piece of pie dough on a lightly floured cutting board. Cut into 1- to 1 1/4-inch-wide strips with a knife. Set aside.Unroll the remaining piece of pie dough. Cut three 1-inch-wide strips from the middle of the round and press the strips together, end to end, to form one long strip. (This will be used for the piecrust rim.)Transfer the partially baked cake to a rack; cool slightly. Drain the strawberry mixture and spoon it onto the cake, pressing the berries into the top to hold them in place. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F.Arrange half of the pie dough strips in parallel rows over the strawberries, about 1 inch apart, using the shorter strips on the ends.Fold back every other strip halfway. Lay one of the remaining strips across the center of the pie, perpendicular to the others. Unfold the strips over the perpendicular one.
