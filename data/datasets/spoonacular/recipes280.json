Place pan on baking sheet and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes.Turn oven off but leave cheesecake in oven for another 1 hours to 2 hours. Cheesecake should still have some jiggle in the middle when you shake the pan.Place on counter and let cool to room temperature.To make topping, melt butter in a small skillet. Add almonds and sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until almonds are light brown. Let cool partially (you don't want to put it on the cheesecake while it is hot, but if they cool too much the almonds will all stick together.) and sprinkle on top of cheesecake.Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.For Amaretto Cream Sauce, heat heavy cream in a small saucepan until simmering. In a small bowl, whisk together amaretto and cornstarch. Add to cream and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in sugar and let cool.
