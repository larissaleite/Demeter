In a large bowl, combine the soup, mayonnaise, lemon juice, curry powder, green beans and mushrooms. Drain and stir in the rigatoni. Cube the cooked chicken breasts and stir this in as well. Transfer this mixture to a large casserole dish.                            Sprinkle the cheese on top over all. In a medium bowl, combine the butter and the corn flakes and spread this mixture over the cheese. Finally, top off by sprinkling with the parsley.                            Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly.
