Blend until smooth and season to taste with salt.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Adjust top oven rack to 6 inches below the broiler. Preheat broiler to high. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Using your hands or a pair of tongs, toss asparagus with one tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt, then arrange the asparagus stalks on one side of the baking sheet. Drizzle another tablespoon of oil on the other side, add the salmon fillets, and coat them in the oil. Set the fillets skin-side down and sprinkle with salt.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Set the baking sheet underneath the broiler, with the asparagus directly underneath the flame. Cook until the asparagus stalks are bright green and tender, flipping after a couple minutes, about five minutes total. Rotate baking sheet so that the salmon fillets are directly underneath the flame and continue to cook until they have browned on top and an instant read thermometer inserted into the deepest part registers about 130\u00b0F, about 5 minutes longer. (Note: If your broiler is large enough for both to cook at the same time, cook for five minutes, then transfer baking sheet to a lower rack to continue cooking for another five minutes.)                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Divide the asparagus between four plates. Spoon some of the sauce on each plate, and then set a salmon fillet on top.

Remove the roast from the oven and tent loosely with aluminum foil; allow it to rest at least 20 minutes before slicing.Serve with applesauce or a good chutney, if desired.Nutrition (per serving): 551 calories, 44.8g total fat, 133.8mg cholesterol, 707.3mg sodium, 606.1mg potassium, <1g carbohydrates, 0g fiber, 0g sugar, 33.8g protein", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/stuffed-pork-loin-roast-476846", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Courgette---ricotta-pasta-217198.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 217198, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Courgette & ricotta pasta", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 231.73, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "small bunch basil, most chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "basil", "metaInformation": ["small", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "bunch", "unitShort": "bunch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "bunch"}, {"originalString": "4 courgettes, halved and thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "courgettes", "metaInformation": ["halved", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11477, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "zest 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated, plus extra to serve (optional)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan", "metaInformation": ["grated", "(or vegetarian alternative)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "300g pasta shapes", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "pasta", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 300.0, "id": 20420, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "50g pine nuts, toasted", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "pine nuts", "metaInformation": ["toasted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pine-nuts.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 12147, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "250g tub ricotta", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "ricotta", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 1036, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 shallot, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shallot", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11677, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 97.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2195649/courgette-and-ricotta-pasta", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Heat the oil in a large frying pan.Cook the shallot and courgettes for8 mins until softened.

Add to the marinade and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons oil and toss well to coat. Whisk egg whites and mustard in a second large shallow dish. Season both mixtures with pepper.Preheat oven to 350F.

Gently shake off any excess crumbs and place the skewers on the prepared rack.Bake the chicken, turning halfway through, until golden brown and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the dipping sauce: Place onion in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper; process until smooth. With the motor running, add oil through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream until the mixture is thick and well combined.

Microwave for 30 seconds and allow to cool to room temperature, 5 to 10 minutes.                                                                                                                               10                                                                            Break gingersnaps into pieces and place in large zipper-lock bag. Place bag on kitchen towel and beat with mallet until gingersnaps are broken into medium and small pieces (cookies shouldn\u2019t be pulverized).                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Pulse peaches, ginger, 1/4 cup sugar, and vanilla in blender or food processor until completely pur\u00e9ed. Strain into large bowl. Stir in gingersnap pieces.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Stir remaining 1 cup sugar, water, and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil syrup until it registers 238\u00b0F on candy thermometer, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            13                                                                            While syrup boils, with electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium speed soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.                                                                                                                            14                                                                            When syrup reaches temperature, with mixer running on medium-high speed, slowly and carefully pour into egg whites. Beat until outside of bowl is cool to the touch and whites are thick and glossy, about 7 minutes. Add gelatin and beat just to combine.                                                                                                                            15                                                                            Mix 1/3 of meringue into peach mixture. With rubber spatula, fold in remaining meringue.                                                                                                                            16                                                                            Scrape meringue over cake in springform and smooth out top. Arrange top of cake over meringue. Freeze until set, at least 6 hours.                                                                                                                            17                                                                            For the Chocolate Glaze and Assembly: Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.                                                                                                                               18                                                                            Arrange cake on cooling rack set inside rimmed baking sheet.                                                                                                                            19                                                                            Spread 1 cup glaze over top and sides of cake with offset spatula. Freeze until glaze is almost set, about 5 minutes. Pour remaining glaze over cake, and working quickly, smooth sides and top. Press gingersnaps into perimeter of cake. Freeze until set, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                             20                                                                            Run a large knife under hot water until blade is warm.
