Cook (without moving) the noodle bun for about 3-4 minutes and then flip over and cook an additional 2-3 minutes or until all noodles are compact. There will be a slight char on both sides.While the bun is cooking, place your tomato on a skillet with cooking spray and sear it for about 1 minute and flip over and cook for another 30 seconds. Set aside.Place one bun on the bottom and smear with avo-goat cheese spread. On top, place the kale, then onions, then tomato. Smear more of the spread on the bottom of the other bun and place on top.Use a toothpick to secure the sandwich and enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/spiralized-sandwich-bun-563771", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cookin Canuck", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grilled-Pineapple-Chili-Pork-Chops-609029.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 609029, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Grilled Pineapple Chili Pork Chops", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 492.87, "creditText": "Cookin Canuck", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 (1/2-inch thick) bone-in pork chops", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bone-in pork chops", "metaInformation": ["bone-in", "(1/)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-chop-bone-in.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 16.0, "id": 10036, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd tsp chili powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2009, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp ground cumin", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cumin", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002014, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002030, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd tsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 4053, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup frozen pineapple concentrate, thawed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "pineapple", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "thawed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 9266, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.cookincanuck.com/2014/08/grilled-pineapple-chili-pork-chops-recipe/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg", "id": 404706, "name": "grill"}], "step": "Preheat the grill to medium.

Shrimp and GritsFrom the Kitchen of Deep South DishPrep time: 20 min |Cook time: 30 min |Yield: About 4 to 6 servingsIngredientsFor the Grits:4 cups of water2 tablespoons of unsalted butter6 small cloves of garlic, finely minced1/2 cup of heavy cream1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup of uncooked quick grits2 cups of shredded cheddar cheeseFor the Shrimp:1 tablespoon of canola oil1 cup of mild andouille or other spicy smoked sausage2 pounds of small to medium shrimp, peeled and deveined2 tablespoons of canola oil1 tablespoon of butter1 tablespoon of all purpose flour1/2 cup of chopped onion1/4 cup of chopped green bell pepper1/8 cup of chopped celery1 can of Rotel or diced tomatoes, well drained3 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning (like Slap Ya Mama)1-1/2 cups of shrimp stock or chicken broth1 tablespoon of unsalted butterKosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to tasteRed pepper flakes, optionalSliced green onion, for garnishInstructionsMise en place is a good practice here, so gather all of the ingredients for the grits and set aside. Chop up the vegetables and get everything ready for the shrimp before you start.Fill a saucepan with four cups of water and place on a back burner over medium for the grits. You want to keep the water warmed so that you can start the grits quickly. Peel and devein shrimp and lay the shrimp out in an even layer on a baking pan covered with paper towels. Reserve heads and shells to make stock, if desired. Cover shrimp with paper towels and pat to remove as much moisture as possible; change paper towels if needed and set aside. Saute the garlic in a large skillet with the butter just until tender. Scrape out and set the butter and garlic aside in a small bowl - you'll need this for the grits later.In the same skillet, add the tablespoon of canola oil, and over medium heat, saute the andouille sausage. Remove sausage and set aside. To the same skillet, add half of the shrimp and cook just until barely pink. Remove and set aside with the sausage; add remaining shrimp and repeat.Sometimes water will accumulate from cooking the shrimp. If so, pour off the residual water and wipe the skillet clean. Otherwise, use the pan drippings and add enough canola oil to equal about 2 tablespoons and add 1 tablespoon of butter. Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and cook and stir for about 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned. Add the onion, bell pepper and celery; cook and stir for about 3 minutes. Add the drained, diced tomatoes and Cajun seasoning, cook and stir about 3 minutes. Slowly add in the stock or broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. While the sauce is simmering, bring water to a boil for the grits and stir in the heavy cream. Slowly stir in the grits and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly.Add the shrimp and sausage back to the skillet and heat through. To thicken the sauce, stir in 1 tablespoon of butter, taste, add salt and pepper and adjust seasonings as needed. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes if desired. To the grits, add in the reserved cooked garlic and butter and the shredded cheese, just until the cheese is incorporated and fully melted. Spoon cheese grits into serving bowl, top with several spoons of the shrimp mixture and garnish bowls with sliced green onion.Cook's Notes: If you prefer, substitute stone-ground grits. Can also substitute chicken stock or broth if desired, however if you do use a commercial broth, you will likely want to increase seasonings - just taste, adjust and keep tasting. When tomatoes are at peak and in season, substitute four Romas, seeded, and chopped. Feel free to experiment with your favorite cheeses in the grits as well. For a different experience, serve these over triangles of friedgrit cakes, or cooked pasta or rice.Andouille sausage is a highly spiced smoked sausage that is blended with Cajun spices, adding a spicy kick and great flavor to these dishes. If you substitute kielbasa or other smoked sausages in recipes where it calls for Andouille, it will affect the outcome of your dish and youll need to make adjustments in the seasonings you use.Tip: For creamy grits, slowly stir in the grits to the boiling water/cream mixture, a little at a time - don't dump them in all at once. Then while they are cooking, continue to stir them often the entire time they are cooking, until creamy and thickened. If grits are kept holding and thicken too much, add additional cream and beat to loosen.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gulf-coast-shrimp-and-grits-244755", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sour-cream-mashed-potatoes-with-roasted-garlic-dijon-mustard-and-bacon-771319.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 771319, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes With Roasted Garlic, Dijon Mustard and Bacon", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 212.9, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": ["crumbled", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10123, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 stick softened butter or 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "stick", "unitShort": "stick", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "stick"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons dijon mustard", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "dijon mustard", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1002046, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 heads garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "heads", "unitShort": "heads", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "heads"}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Freshly ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1056, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 pounds whole russet or Yukon gold potatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "yukon gold potatoes", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10211362, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 72.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/sour-cream-mashed-potatoes-with-roasted-garlic-dijon-mustard-and-bacon-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 24, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}], "step": "Put the potatoes in a saucepan; cover with cold water and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt.

It\u2019s your choice really which way you want to do it.Note too that you can use your own combination of herbs, and even substitute olive oil for butter, or use a combination of olive oil and butter.For other variations of herbed rice, see herb-loaded rice versions one and two, and the garlic, basil and onion fried rice.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/braised-pork-tenderloin-with-herb-and-garlic-rice-520955", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Daydreamer Desserts", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Medias-de-Seda-555162.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 555162, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Medias de Seda", "preparationMinutes": 0, "pricePerServing": 197.53, "creditText": "Daydreamer Desserts", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 ounces evaporated milk", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "evaporated milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/evaporated-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1214, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup - 1 cup ice cubes", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "ice cubes", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crushed-ice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10014412, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 ounce kahlua", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "kahlua", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coffee-liqueur.jpg", "unitLong": "ounce", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93716, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "maraschino cherries, garnish", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "maraschino cherries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maraschino.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9328, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "2 ounces rum", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "rum", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rum-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 14037, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc-1/2 ounce granadine", "aisle": "?", "name": "granadine", "metaInformation": [], "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.25, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 19.0, "sourceUrl": "http://daydreamerdesserts.com/2013/05/medias-de-seda.html/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 12, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}], "step": "Combine all ingredients except maraschino cherries and ground cinnamon in a blender.
