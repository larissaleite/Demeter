Fill the cupcake liners about 2/3 full.  Bake for 9-10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Cool completely.To make the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in a double boiler over simmering water.  Whisk the mixture constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is warm, about 160F. Pour the mixture into a clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  Beat on high speed until it forms stiff peaks.  Continue beating until cool, about 6 minutes.  Switch to the paddle attachment.  With the mixer on medium-low, add the butter, several tablespoons at a time.  Beat well after each addition.  If the mixture separates after all the butter has been added, continue to beat on high speed until it is smooth, 3-5 minutes.  Beat in both extracts.  Reduce the speed to low and continue to beat for 2 minutes to remove any air bubbles.

Arrange the seasoned tomato halves, cut-side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven until the tomatoes are very soft, 2 hours. Let cool 15 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a work surface and coarsely chop.Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, the remaining 1 teaspoon basil and 1/4 teaspoon oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the roasted tomatoes, water and tomato paste, stirring until the tomato paste is incorporated. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in salt and pepper.To prepare lasagna: Meanwhile, combine ricotta, 3/4 cup mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan, salt, oregano and pepper in a bowl.Increase oven temperature to 350. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.Spread 2 cups of the tomato sauce in the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles. Top the noodles with half the spinach. Dollop half of the ricotta mixture over the spinach, then spread 1 cup of tomato sauce over the ricotta. Repeat the layers once more, pressing down on the filling as you layer; the pan will be very full. Place the remaining 3 noodles on top and spread with the remaining tomato sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Cover with foil that has been coated with cooking spray.Bake the lasagna for 50 minutes. Uncover and bake until the cheese browns slightly, about 10 minutes more.

Cover the bowl with a lid or a towel and let rise until the dough doubles in size, approximately 1 hour.    Spray cupcake tins with non-stick baking spray or coat with melted butter.    Break off pieces of dough and roll into balls that fill each cupcake slot. The balls should almost fill each depression. Both Hippo Flambe and Baking Bites go into detail about how to make sure that each roll is exactly the same size. I don't really care about homemade things all being the same size. I like that people can choose whether they want a bigger one or a smaller one.    Cover with a clean, damp dish towel and let rise for 25 minutes. After rising, mine looked like the photo above.    Bake at 375 F for about 20 minutes, until rolls are a deep golden brown on the top.
