cups water to a boil over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan. Add the millet and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the millet until it's tender and all the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove it from the heat and let sit, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the oil, and fluff the millet with a fork. Serve warm or at room temperature. (The millet can be made up to 2 days ahead and reheated in the microwave.)Make the yogurt-hummus sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, hummus, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and hot sauce in a small bowl.Make the tomato-pepper salad: Stir together the tomatoes, peppers, parsley and a pinch of salt in another small bowl.Assemble the salad: Using four 16-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids, evenly divide the beets among the jars, then add the following in separate layers: the millet (press it down a little to make room), grape leaves, tomato-pepper salad, cucumbers and yogurt-hummus sauce. Top each with a sprinkling of za'atar. Pack the french-fried onions (about 2 tablespoons per salad) and the lemon wedge in separate small containers for transporting.Just before serving, transfer the jarred ingredients to a large bowl, add the onions and a squeeze of lemon juice and toss.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

warm). Grate 3/4 teaspoon lemon zest and then squeeze 1 tablespoon of juice; reserve separately. Put one bag of the blueberries, the maple syrup, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon of the lemon zest into a small (8-inch) skillet with 1/3 cup water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, and continue to simmer until the mixture is syrupy and thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the blueberry sauce from the heat and set aside. (You should have about 3/4 cup.)Meanwhile, whisk the cake mix, sour cream, eggs, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and 1 cup water in a large bowl until smooth and thick.Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; lightly coat with cooking spray. Drop the batter by 1/4-cupfuls into the skillet, leaving 1 inch between each. Cook until bubbles rise to the top of the pancakes and they are set around the edges and lightly browned on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes. Add about 5 blueberries to the top of each pancake and then carefully flip (the tops of the pancakes will still be a little soft). Continue to cook until lightly browned and cooked through, 5 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining batter.Top the pancakes with the blueberry sauce and a dusting of confectioners' sugar. Serve with butter and maple syrup on the side.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

lard in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the masa harina and beat 2 minutes. Add the baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; continue beating until incorporated, about 5 minutes. Add the hot broth and continue beating until the dough is soft and fluffy (it should pull away from the side of the bowl easily). Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit about 10 minutes.Place the corn husks in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until softened, about 8 minutes. Drain.Make the filling: Roast the poblanos over the flame of a gas burner, turning, until charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool. Peel the poblanos with your fingers and discard the stems and seeds, then coarsely chop. Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, corn and poblanos and cook 2 more minutes. Add the crema; when it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and stir in the cheese until melted. Season with salt and set aside to cool.Tear 4 corn husks into 1/2-inch-thick strips to use as ties; set aside. Assemble the tamales: Hold an open corn husk in one hand; spread about 2 tablespoons dough on the husk, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border on all sides. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling down the center, then fold in the long sides of the husk to cover the filling and fold up the narrow short end (leave the wide end open). Tie a strip of corn husk around the tamale to hold the folded flaps in place. Repeat to make 12 tamales.Place the tamales, open-side up, in a steamer basket set in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot by several inches, but not enough to touch the tamales. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low; cover the pot with a kitchen towel and a lid and steam until firm, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, adding more water to the pot if needed. The tamales should pull away from the husks without sticking; if they're still sticky, continue cooking. Let stand at least 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen                                                    Recipe courtesy of Marcela Valladolid for Food Network Magazine

Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until blistered and slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the zucchini and lemon zest and cook, lightly crushing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon, until the zucchini is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Transfer the zucchini-tomato mixture to a large bowl. Add the pasta and cheese and toss. Stir in half of the chives and about 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking water, adding more to loosen, if needed. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Over an open flame, roast the hatch, poblano, serrano and Anaheim chile peppers. Roast until the skins are charred and black all over, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove chiles from the flame and immediately place in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside and allow to steam for 8 to 10 minutes. Once the peppers have cooled, scrape away and discard the charred skin, then remove the stems and seeds. Finely dice the flesh and set aside.In a small bowl, combine the milk and panko and set aside.  In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, cumin, salt, black pepper, cayenne, panko-milk mixture and diced peppers. Mix all the ingredients together. Using your hands, shape the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, about 3 ounces each.  Evenly space the meatballs on a baking sheet and place into the oven. Bake until firm and browned, 12 to 14 minutes.Place the meatballs on a large platter, garnish with cilantro and serve.

garam masala and paprika, stirring often, until fragrant (approximately 2-3 minutes). Let cool completely.2 Whisk in the cooled spice-oil mixture into the yogurt, then mix in the lemon juice, garlic, salt and ginger.3 Cut deep slashes (to the bone) in 3-4 places on the leg/thigh pieces. Just make 2-3 cuts if you are using separate drumsticks and thighs.  Coat the chicken in the marinade, cover and chill for at least an hour (preferably 6 hours), no more than 8 hours. 4 Prepare your grill so that one side is quite hot over direct heat, the other side cooler, not over direct heat. If using charcoal, leave one side of the grill without coals, so you have a hot side and a cooler side. If you are using a gas grill, just turn on one-half of the burners. Use tongs to wipe the grill grates with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil. Take the chicken out of the marinade and shake off the excess. You want the chicken coated, but not gloppy. Put the chicken pieces on the hot side of the grill and cover. Cook 2-3 minutes before checking. 5 Turn the chicken so it is brown (even a little bit charred) on all sides, then move it to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook for at least 20 minutes, up to 40 minutes (or longer) depending on the size of the chicken and the temperature of the grill. The chicken is done when its juices run clear.Let it rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. It\u2019s also great at room temperature or even cold the next day.Serve with naan, and Indian flatbread, or with Indian style rice, with yogurt-based raita on the side.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/tandoori-chicken-245974", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Crunchy Creamy Sweet", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pumpkin-Spice-Crumb-Bars-595868.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 595868, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Pumpkin Spice Crumb Bars", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Crunchy Creamy Sweet", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 tsp baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c canned pumpkin puree", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "canned pumpkin puree", "metaInformation": ["canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-puree.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11424, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 Tbsp all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3/4 c granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 c Greek yogurt or sour cream (I used 2% Plain Chobani Greek yogurt)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["plain", "sour", "2%", "(I used Chobani Greek yogurt)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1256, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp ground cloves", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cloves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2011, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c unsalted butter, melted, cooled to room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "cooled", "melted", "room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1145, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 13.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/2013/09/12/pumpkin-spice-crumb-bars-recipe/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 12998, "instructions": "Prepare the 8\" square pan by greasing the sides and the bottom.

"instructions": "For crepes:1. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk together milk, eggs, and vanilla. Gradually pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Whisk in the melted butter. Pour through a sieve into a large pitcher or measuring cup. Discard the lumps. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. (Alternatively, put all of the ingredients into a blender and puree until smooth.)2. Lightly coat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan with butter. Heat over medium heat until just starting to smoke. Remove from heat and pour 2 Tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Swirl and tilt pan to spread the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat and return pan to heat. Cook until edges are golden and center is dry, about 30 seconds per side.3. Slide the crepe onto an overturned plate. Repeat with remaining batter, coating the pan with butter as needed. Stack the crepes on the plate and let cool.For Meyer Lemon Mousse:1. Place the water in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Let stand for 5-10 minutes to soften the gelatin.2. In a non-reactive saucepan with a heavy bottom, whisk together eggs and yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and zest. Cook over medium heat, stirring or whisking constantly, until the curd is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat.3. Add gelatin to the curd. Stir until smooth and gelatin is dissolved. Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time.4. Pour through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any bits of egg or undissolved gelatin. Press a piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper directly onto the surface of the curd. Let cool slightly then place in fridge to chill for several hours or until very cold.5. Once curd is properly chilled, stir to loosen it and fold in the whipped cream. Refrigerate for one hour before assembling cake.For Candied Meyer Lemons:1. Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large saucepan, and heat until sugar dissolves. Add lemons, and cover surface with parchment. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until rinds are translucent, about 30 minutes. Let lemons cool in syrup.2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lemons to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Let stand for allow excess syrup to drip off.To assemble:1. Place one crepe on a flat serving dish. Spread about 1/4 cup of the mousse onto the crepe. Top with another crepe and another 1/4 cup of mousse. Repeat layering crepes and mousse. (Use 15 crepes, ending with a crepe on top.) Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.2. Top crepe cake with 1/4 cup whipped cream and 3 or 4 candied lemon slices.

Take another piece of parchment and lay it over the top and continue to smooth it out as evenly as possible.Refrigerate for at least an hour until fully set.  It will set up just like polenta.Meanwhile make the dipping sauce by whisking all the ingredients together in a small bowl.  Chill till needed.  If you like a thinner sauce you can whisk in a little water.When the dough is completely chilled, carefully lift it out of the pan and cut into 1/4 x 4 inch strips for matchstick style, and 1/2 x 4 inch for thicker style. Heat about 1/2 inch of oil in a large skillet till it reaches 350-360F. Be patient, this takes a few minutes, and you  want the oil to be hot enough to crisp the fries and not soak into them.

Add the chicken, season lightly with salt and pepper, and brown on both sides, about 7 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the onions, peppers, and celery, and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, Cajun seasoning, cayenne, salt and pepper, and give it a stir. Stir in the rice. Add the chicken back to the pot, along with the broth and tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. (Reserve 3 cups rice mixture for Round 2 Recipe Cajun Quesadillas and Online Round 2 Recipe Cajun Red Bean and Rice Soup.) Serve, garnished with parsley.

Sift all-purpose flour and cake flour into a mixing bowl. Add baking powder, baking soda and salt and whisk 20 seconds, set aside.In a food processor, pulse together 3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp granulated sugar with lime zest until finely ground, about 1 minute. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip together butter with lime sugar mixture until pale and fluffy (if you don't have the paddle attachment that constantly scrapes bowl, then occasionally throughout entire mixing process, stop mixer and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl). Mix in egg, then mix in egg whites one at a time, adding in vanilla with second egg white. In the liquid measuring cup used to measure buttermilk, whisk together buttermilk with lime juice. Working in three separate batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture, add 1/3 of the flour mixture alternating with 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture and mixing just until combined after each addition. Divide batter among 12 paper lined muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center of cupcake comes out clean, about 18 - 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool several minutes in muffin tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly while preparing simple syrup.For the simple syrup:In a small bowl, whisk together 1 Tbsp lime juice with 1 Tbsp granulated sugar until sugar has dissolved. Brush mixture over warm cupcakes (use all of it, I did about 2 light coats over each cupcake). Allow cupcakes to cool completely.For the frosting:In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip butter until pale and fluffy. Mix in 1/4 cup powdered sugar then mix in maraschino cherry juice and optional red food coloring. With mixer set on low speed, slowly add remaining 2 1/4 cups powdered sugar (add an additional 1/4 as needed to reach desired consistency), then increase mixer to medium and whip until light and fluffy. Pipe or spread over cooled cupcakes, top with each with a maraschino cherry and a lime slice and sprinkle edges with sprinkles if desired.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

With the mixer on low, slowly incorporate the salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and flour {in 1/2 cup increments, switching to 1/4 cup increments as the dough starts to form}. Once the dough has pulled away from the sides and is tacky but won't stick to your hands when pressed, turn the mixer on medium to high speed and knead for 6 minutes.After this, remove dough and place into a greased bowl. Turn dough around in bowl to lightly grease dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a draft free warm spot in your kitchen.Remove plastic wrap, punch down dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll into logs and place in greased mini loaf pans. I don't know the dimensions, but THIS is basically the pan I used. Lightly cover loaves with plastic wrap and let rise another hour.After this time, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake loaves for 20 minutes or until tops are lightly golden.

Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, optional salt; set aside. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the next 5 wet ingredients (through vanilla). Add the wet mixture to the dry, mixing lightly with a spoon or folding with a spatula until just combined. Lumps will be present and this is okay. Don't overmix or try to stir them smooth; set aside. In a small bowl, toss the fruit with 1 tablespoon flour. The flour helps to prevent the fruit from sinking while baking. Gently and briefly fold the fruit into batter. I used a frozen fruit blend with cherries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. If using frozen, add the fruit frozen and do not thaw because frozen fruit runs and bleeds less than if\u00a0 thawed. If using fresh fruit, baking time will be significantly (possibly drastically) less because the fruit is much warmer and won't chill down the batter overall, nor will it release any where near the water into the batter that frozen fruit does. Turn batter out into prepared pan; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the cream cheese with 1 tablespoon sugar until smooth. Dollop the cream cheese mixture haphazardly over the cake batter. With a toothpick, gently and lightly swirl the cream cheese. I don't do much swirling because I like to see bigger, noticeable patches of cream cheese rather than thin streaks in my cake; personal preference. Bake until done. I hesitate to give a baking range because you must watch your cake, not the clock. Bake until center is slightly domed and set, golden and rosy in color, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. I estimate 50 to 55 minutes is a good range if using frozen fruit. At any time your cake is beginning to look a bit too golden brown before you suspect the center will set up, tent it with a sheet of foil laid across the top. I baked for 52 minutes total, and at the 45 minute mark, I tented with foil. Baking times will range dramatically based on if baking with fresh or frozen berries; ranging from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the temperature of the berries going into the batter and how much water they release. Place pan on a wire rack and allow cake to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Optionally, dust with confectioners' sugar or a simple glaze. This\u00a0vanilla cream cheese glaze, this buttery vanilla glaze, this browned butter glaze, or this\u00a0lemon glaze are all excellent, quick, and easy options. Cake will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days.

heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saut for 5 to 6 minutes, until the onion is translucent.Stir in the curry paste. In a small bowl, whisk together some of the broth with the almond butter until smooth. Add the mixture to the pot, along with the carrots, sweet potatoes, salt, and remaining vegetable broth. Stir until combined.Bring the soup to a low boil over medium-high heat and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes and carrots are fork-tender.Ladle the soup carefully into a blender. You will likely have to do this in a couple of batches, depending on the size of your blender. With the lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape, blend on low and slowly increase the speed until the soup is completely smooth. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender and blend the soup directly in the pot.)Taste, and season with salt and black pepper. If you'd like more spice, add a pinch or full  teaspoon cayenne pepper, and blend again. Transfer the soup back to the pot and reheat if necessary. If desired, you can thin the soup out with a bit more broth if its too thick for your preference.Ladle the soup into bowls and top with minced cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, and optional tamari almonds. This soup will keep in the fridge for up to a week, and freezes well for 1 to 2 months.To make the roasted tamari almonds: Preheat the oven to 325F (160C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, toss the almonds with the tamari until the almond pieces are fully coated.
