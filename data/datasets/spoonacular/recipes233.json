Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 9-inch round, 3-inch deep cake pan with nonstick spray. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.2. Put carrots into a large mixing bowl.3. In the bowl of a food processor, process flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt for 5 seconds. If you don't have a processor, whisk these ingredients together very well instead. Add the flour mixture to the carrots and toss until they are well-coated with flour.4. In the bowl of the food processor, combine sugar, brown sugar, eggs and yogurt. While the processor is running, drizzle in the oil. (Again, if you don't have a food processor, use a hand mixer instead... adding oil slowly while mixing). Pour this mixture into the carrot mixture and stir just until combined. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 45 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and bake for another 20 minutes or until the cake reaches 205 to 210 degrees F. in the center. Remove the pan from the oven and allow cake to cool 15 minutes in the pan. After 15 minutes, turn the cake out onto a rack and allow cake to cool completely.Frost the cake:5. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese with butter and beat with a hand mixer on medium-speed just until blended. Add the vanilla and beat until combined. Add powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time, beating until smooth between each addition. Use your own judgment on whether or not you need the entire 2 1/2 cups (preference on consistency). If the frosting is too soft, refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes before frosting. Spread on a thick layer on top of the cake or frost top and the sides if you prefer.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/carrot-cake-518125", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Mother Thyme", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Homemade-Spaghetti-Os-515405.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 515405, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Homemade Spaghetti O\u2019s", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 70.75, "creditText": "Mother Thyme", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup 2% milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["2%"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "8 ounce pasta rings, cooked", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "pasta", "metaInformation": ["cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 20420, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "Pinch of salt to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "tomato paste", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11887, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "16 ounce tomato sauce", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "tomato sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 11549, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 91.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.motherthyme.com/2013/02/homemade-spaghetti-os.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}], "step": "Add tomato sauce and paste to a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until heated through.Reduce heat to a low simmer and slowly whisk in milk and cheese.
