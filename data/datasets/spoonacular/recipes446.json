Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.2. Prepare the cake: In a large bowl with an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, milk, and butter. Blend until the butter is evenly mixed. Add the vanilla. Beat at low speed for 1 minute, then increase the speed to high and beat for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl constantly, beating until the mixture is light and fluffy.3. In another bowl, beat egg whites until stiff. Gently but thoroughly fold the whites into the cake batter. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.4. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cakes are no longer jiggly in the center. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Split the cooled layers horizontally to make 4 layers in all. (I use a serrated knife\u2026 and gently saw around the center to cut even layers).5. Prepare the filling: In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in water until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and cook 2 minutes longer, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with a fork. Slowly stir about 1/4 cup of the hot mixture into the egg yolks, whisking quickly while adding the hot liquid. (You don\u2019t want to create scrambled eggs, so be sure to add the hot mixture slowly, whisking it into the eggs as quickly as possible). Continue adding 1/4 cups of the hot mixture to the eggs until you have warmed up the egg mixture. Whisk the egg yolk mixture back to the mixture in the saucepan. Cook over low heat until the mixture boils, whisking constantly, then continue to cook for 2 minutes, stirring.6. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and lemon juice and zest. Transfer half of the hot filling to a small bowl and set aside to cool. Add the white chocolate to the hot filling in the saucepan and stir until the chocolate is melted; set aside. In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until fluffy. Beat in the white chocolate mixture until light and smooth.

Cook pasta until al dente; drain and return to the pot.Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute.  Slowly whisk in the milk and cook, stirring, until thickened.  Add in the squash puree, nutmeg, cinnamon and sage leaves.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.Add the sauce into the pot with the pasta and stir to coat. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with both cheeses.  Bake until the cheese is browned and bubbly, about 10-15 minutes.-------------------------slightly adapted from The Rachael Ray Show", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/butternut-bowties-fridays-with-rachael-ray-476064", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 100, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lifes Ambrosia", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Robiola--Roasted-Garlic-and-Kale-Grilled-Cheese-567697.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 60, "id": 567697, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Robiola, Roasted Garlic and Kale Grilled Cheese", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 190.21, "creditText": "Lifes Ambrosia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 tablespoons butter, divided", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "5 crimini mushrooms, sliced thin", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "crimini mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["sliced", "thin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11266, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "8 slices french bread", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "french bread", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crusty-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 8.0, "id": 18029, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "1 head garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "5 cups chopped kale", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "kale", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/kale.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11233, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces robiola bosina cheese, sliced", "aisle": "?", "name": "robiola bosina cheese", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 92.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2013/04/robiola-roasted-garlic-and-kale-grilled-cheese-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 15, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png", "id": 404765, "name": "aluminum foil"}], "step": "Cut the top 1/4 inch off of the garlic head.

After 2 hours, return the saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil. Place a strainer over a large bowl and strain the mixture through, discarding the chestnuts. Return the chestnut-infused milk to the saucepan. Add the chestnut paste and use a whisk or an immersion blender to fully incorporate the paste. Add the chocolate and blend or whisk until the chocolate is melted and completely incorporated. The roasted chestnut hot chocolate can be made and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</p><p>9. To serve, rewarm the chestnut hot chocolate over medium-low heat and divide among 8 mugs.
