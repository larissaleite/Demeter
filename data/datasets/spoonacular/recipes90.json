Return the skillet to medium heat, add the fennel and season with salt and the red pepper flakes. Stir with a wooden spoon to coat the fennel with the oil and pancetta drippings and saute for just a minute or two, until the fennel begins to sizzle.Add 1/4 cup water and stir and scrape the bottom to dislodge and dissolve any tasty cooked-on pancetta bits. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and braise, stirring a few times, until the fennel is tender with just a little resistance, about 7 minutes.Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan, along with the tomatoes and garlic.Increase the heat to medium and saute, uncovered, shaking and stirring frequently, until the tomatoes begin to burst, about 10 minutes. Stir often and scrape up the lovely caramelized crust that will develop on the bottom of the skillet. When about half the tomatoes have burst, about 12 minutes, add another 2 to 3 tablespoons of water and the pancetta, cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer, stirring occassionally, while you prepare the fish.3. Inspect the monkfish. Most monkfish comes from the market with a thin grayish, rather slimy membrane covering the fish. This is a natural layer that exists between the skin and the pure white fillet and it should be removed for aesthetic and textural reasons. Some markets trim this for you, but most do not. using a sharp paring knife or fillet knife, trim away the membrane without cutting into the fish. Trim off any dark patches on the monkfish as well.[I actually found it quite difficult to cut away all the dark bits. I did the best I could but, retrospectively, I shouldn't have stressed so much; the dark bits that remained were fine and mostly obscured by the sauce.]Cut the monkfish fillet into 4 equal portions.4. Pat the monkfish fillets dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium nonstick skillet (9 to 10-inch) over medium high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the fish and saute until it has lost its raw appearance and the outside is pale golden, 4 minutes per side.5. Transfer the fillets to the simmering tomato-fennel sauce. With a rubber spatula, scrape any oil or juices from the nonstick skillet onto the fillets. Cover and simmer gently over low heat, turning the fillets after 4 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through, about 8 minutes total.6. Transfer the monkfish to warm plates. Stir the basil into the sauce, taste for salt and pepper and spoon it around the fish on each plate.Serve and enjoy!Tags: braising, fish, Molly StevensCategories: Recipes, Seafood", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/molly-stevens-braised-monkfish-with-cherry-tomatoes-basil-4116", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Blueberry-Lime-Rickey-202428.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 202428, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Blueberry Lime Rickey", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 ounces (a scant 2 cups) frozen blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "(a scant 2 cups)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 9050, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup blueberry syrup", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberry", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 9050, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Ice", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "ice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crushed-ice.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10014412, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "3/4 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9152, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon lime juice from 1 lime", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9160, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 47.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/02/homemade-blueberry-lime-rickey-drink-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 35, "aggregateLikes": 197, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            For the Blueberry Syrup: Combine the blueberries and water in a small saucepan over low heat until soft enough to smash easily with the back of a spatula, about 5 minutes.

Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, carrots and onions; cook until tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the turkey and thyme, and continue to cook, breaking the turkey up with a spoon, until the turkey is cooked through and lightly browned. Stir in the ketchup and cook until lightly caramelized. Stir the broth and flour together in a small bowl until smooth, and then pour into the skillet. Cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peas and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt.Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a medium pot and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until tender when pierced with a knife. Drain the potatoes and return to the pot over low heat. Stir the potatoes for a couple of minutes to dry them out. Add the milk, cheese and scallions, and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Swirl the mashed potatoes over the filling. Lightly mist with nonstick cooking spray and bake until the potatoes are lightly browned and the turkey filling is bubbly around the edges, 10 to 15 minutes.

xanthan gum and salt.For the crust: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. In a small bowl, combine the cookie crumbs, brown sugar, salt, pumpkin pie spice and butter. Reserve about 1/4 cup for topping the finished cheesecakes, then press about 1 heaping tablespoon of the crumb mixture onto the bottom of each cup. Bake until golden, 3 to 4 minutes; let cool completely. Leave the oven on.For the filling: In a medium bowl and using an electric mixer, combine the cream cheese, granulated sugar, eggnog, eggs, vanilla, salt and nutmeg with 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour blend and beat until smooth. Top each crust until each cup is about 3/4 full with filling. Bake until set around the edges but still jiggly in the center, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack, then remove from the tin.For the whipped cream: Using an electric mixer with cleaned beaters, beat together the whipping cream and eggnog on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the confectioners' sugar and pumpkin pie spice; beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Top the cooled cheesecakes with the whipped cream and sprinkle over the reserved cookie crumbs.

the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, celery and peppers. Season with salt and black pepper. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds.Add the beans and water to the pot. Add the cayenne, white pepper, smoked paprika, bay leaves and green onions. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.Discard the bay leaves. Use a potato masher to mash the beans in the pot until the mixture looks creamy. Season well with hot sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper. Ladle into warmed bowls with cooked rice and serve with additional hot sauce on the side.

line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.Place the onion in the bowl of a food processor and process to a smooth paste. Add the bulgur, lamb, 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, the cinnamon, allspice, and mint and process until mixture is smooth and thoroughly combined. Using damp hands, divide the meat mixture into about 24 evenly sized portions (about 2 tablespoons each) and shape into little torpedo shaped meatballs. Brush the top of each meatball with some of the olive oil, then place on the baking sheet and bake until just cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. While the meatballs are baking, make the caramelized onion topping. Heat a medium skillet until hot. Add the 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and, when hot, add the sliced onions, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add the pine nuts and continue cooking until onions are nicely caramelized and pine nuts are golden, about 10 minutes longer. Add the dried fruit and cook for 5 minutes. When the lamb meatballs come out of the oven, transfer to a serving platter and top with the caramelized onion mixture. Drizzle with the pomegranate molasses and serve hot.

Place it on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil that is about 18'' square and securely wrap foil up around the pan's sides. Set aside.Preheat oven to 325\u00b0.for the crust:In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, salt, and pecans. Cut in butter with a rigid pastry cutter or a fork until crumbly. Press evenly onto the bottom of prepared pan. Place pan on a baking sheet and bake for about 14 minutes, or until set. Cool on a wire rack.for the filling:In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugars until smooth. Beat in 1/4 cup flour, cream, and vanilla. Add eggs and beat on low speed just until blended. Remove 1 cup of batter to a small bowl and stir in the melted and cooled chocolate. Spread over cooled crust.In another bowl, mix caramel topping with remaining flour, and then stir in pecans. Drop by tablespoonfuls over the chocolate batter. Top with remaining vanilla batter. Place springform pan in a large baking pan with tall sides and add 1'' of hot water to the larger pan. Bake at 325\u00b0 for about 1 hour and 25 minutes, or just until center is set and top appears dull. Remove springform pan from water bath and remove the foil wrapping. Cool the cheesecake on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a thin knife around the perimeter of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan. Cool 1 hour longer on the wire rack. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight (preferred).for the ganache:Place chocolate chips in a small heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring cream just to a boil.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper/silpat. Pulse pistachio & almond flour + confectioners sugar in food processor till combined, stirring and scraping bottom (carefully) of processor to make sure everything's blended. Sift using a mesh strainer. set aside, covered. In an immaculately clean, large bowl, whisk egg whites on high till foamy. Use a spatula and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure you're not missing any of the whites. Add caster sugar in 3 parts with hand mixer on medium scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula between each addition. When all the sugar has been added turn mixer up to high (this is also when you add a couple of drops of food coloring gel or powder) and whisk till stiff peaks form. Check for stiffness early on because you don't want to overmix, this makes for macaron shells that may not rise, or if they do they'll have grease splotches on them.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, to keep things neat and easier to stir. Pour half the flour/sugar mix into the egg whites and gently stir in a circular motion. Then add the rest of the flour/sugar mix in and, being gentle, fold and stir the flour and egg whites to get your macaronage. Make sure you scrape the bottom of the bowl and the sides so you don't miss any of the dry ingredients. It shouldn't look completely smooth or glossy, but should also not have dry bits anymore, it's almost like wet cement before it's smoothed out. If you scoop some up and let it fall back onto itself, it should settle after several seconds. Pour batter into your piping bag and pipe 1-inch rounds onto your baking trays. After you're done piping, pick up your baking sheet and rap it firmly a couple of times on your counter. This is to get rid of air bubbles trapped at the bottom and to help the macarons form their pieds (feet). For good measure, I pick up the tray and use an open palm to firmly smack the bottom of the tray at all four corners and in the center. If you have little tips that won't settle into the rounds, wet your fingertip and gently flatten them.Let the piped macaronage sit for at least 15 minutes, or till they no longer stick to your dry finger when you touch the surface.

it begins to thicken and slowly comes to a boil. Cook for an additional minute or two or until cornstarch is cooked completely.Remove from the heat and slowly add the butter in several additions, whisking as you go until it has been incorporated completely and the curd is shiny and smooth.Strain curd through a fine-meshed sieve into a small butter, cover surface with plastic wrap, and allow to chill in the fridge.Can be made up to a day or two ahead of time.Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and line a 10 x 15 inch baking sheet (jelly-roll size) lengthwise with parchment paper, allowing it to overhang the shorter edges by 1-2 inches.Place chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and microwave at 20-second increments, stirring with a spatula each time, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Allow to cook on rack until barely lukewarm.Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and 1/3 cup granulated sugar in bowl of stand mixer. Using whisk attachment, mix over medium-high speed for five minutes or until it ribbons and is thick and pale in color.Place in separate bowl and gently fold in melted chocolate. Set aside.In a very clean stand mixer bowl, add egg whites. Turn over low speed using whisk attachment and allow to beat until foamy. Turn up speed slowly and continue to beat until egg whites hold soft peaks.Continue to beat and slowly add remaining granulated sugar and beat just until egg whites hold stiff peaks.Fold a third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten. Add remaining egg whites in two additions, folding gently until just incorporated.Add batter to baking sheet and spread evenly with a large offset spatula. Bake in the middle of the oven for 15-18 minutes or until cake is dry to touch. Remove and place baking sheet on cooling rack. Cover with a two layers of damp paper towels and allow to cool for five minutes.Remove towels and allow cake to cool completely. Loosen edges with knife.Sift cocoa powder evenly over the top of the cake. Invert onto a layer of wax paper--gently peeling off the first wax paper layer.Beat cream until holds soft peaks. Fold in a 1/4 cup of passion fruit curd.Spread a layer of passion fruit curd evenly over the cake. Top with the whipped cream mixture and spread evenly with an offset spatula--leaving a half-inch border along the edges.Using the wax paper as an aid, roll up the cake from short end to short end. (It will most likely crack lightly, but keep going). Carefully transfer the cake to a platter and place seam side down.

charcoal grill with a cover, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high.                                                For the patties:                                        Combine the chuck, sirloin, jerk seasoning, wine, and salt in a large bowl. Mix lightly and form into 6 patties. Refrigerate until ready to grill.                                                For the sauce:                                        Mash the avocado with the lime juice in a bowl.

Place on the grill rack and cook, stirring often, until the mixture is reduced by half.When the grill is ready, brush the grill rack with the oil. Place the patties on the rack over direct heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side, basting often with the glaze until the desired doneness is reached. Brush some of the glaze on the cut sides of the rolls. Place the rolls, cut side down, on the rack and grill until lightly toasted. Remove the rolls and place on a serving plate.To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on each roll bottom. Top with a tomato slice. Add a patty, a dollop of the sauce, and a roll top.

Line a baking pan with parchment and set aside.In a large saucepan placed over medium-high heat, boil the milk, oil, and salt, whisking occasionally. Remove when you start to see large bubbles forming. Working quickly, stir in the tapioca flour. The dough will become VERY tacky and gummy. It will almost become gelatinous.Transfer the dough to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn mixing speed on low and gradually increase to medium. Beat the mixture for 2-3 minutes until it begins to become smooth. Add the grated cheeses and incorporate. Turn the mixing speed down to low and add the eggs one at a time, beat on medium for 2-3 minutes until a sticky, stretchy dough forms.Using an ice cream scoop, create portions by dipping the scoop in water, scooping the batter and placing onto the prepared baking sheet.

Add butter & cut with a pastry blender or fork until pea size crumbs form.  Set aside.Prepare cream cheese: Place cream cheese, sugar, & vanilla in a bowl.  Cream together for 1 minute or until smooth.  Set aside.Prepare pie crust:  In a large bowl, combine flour & salt.  Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or fork until pea size crumbs form.  Whisk egg & add to flour mixture.  Add cold water & white vinegar.  Mix together with hands & form into a ball.  Lightly dust working surface with flour.  Roll out pie dough into a circle about 1/4\" thick.  Place crust into a 9\" standard pie dish.  Cut off excess dough with a knife against the edge of the pie dish.  Crimp edges.Spread cream cheese mixture on the bottom of the prepared pie crust & place in the freezer.For the blueberries: Place frozen berries in a large bowl.  Stir sugar & cornstarch together in a separate bowl & then pour over blueberries.  Using a spatula gently mix the berries.  Place the bowl in the microwave & heat for 60 seconds.  Stir.  Repeat 3 times making sure to gently fold the berries as they thaw slightly (won't be completely thawed, but starting to release juices & soften.)Remove pie crust with cream cheese from the freezer.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup plain panko crumbs over cream cheese (this helps the blueberry liquid from curdling the cream cheese.)  Pour blueberries over the panko.  Top with prepared streusel.Bake at 350*F for 60 minutes or until the blueberry filling starts to bubble.
