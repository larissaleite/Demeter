The batter will be thick.Spread into prepared baking pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top. (You may only need half or 3/4 of the mixture, depending on how cinnamon-y you like things. Save the rest for cinnamon toast!)Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Insert a toothpick to test for doneness. The bars should be set in the middle but still slightly gooey inside. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Lift the foil out of the pan and cut into squares.

Either way, consider it a contender for teatime comfort and supper-party celebration alike.                                                            For the cake: Line the base of your cake pan with parchment paper and grease its sides lightly with butter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Beat the butter and sugar till pale and whipped, either by hand in a bowl with a wooden spoon, or using a freestanding mixer.Mix together the almond meal, polenta and baking powder, and beat some of this into the butter-sugar mixture, followed by 1 egg, then alternate dry ingredients and eggs, beating all the while.Finally, beat in the lemon zest and pour, spoon or scrape the mixture into your prepared pan and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes. It may seem wibbly but, if the cake is cooked, a cake tester should come out cleanish and, most significantly, the edges of the cake will have begun to shrink away from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven to a wire cooling rack, but leave in its pan.For the syrup: Make the syrup by boiling together the lemon juice and confectioners' sugar in a smallish saucepan. Once the confectioners' sugar has dissolved into the juice, you're done. Prick the top of the cake all over with a cake tester (a skewer would be too destructive), pour the warm syrup over the cake, and leave to cool before taking it out of its pan.Make Ahead Note: The cake can be baked up to 3 days ahead and stored in airtight container in a cool place. Will keep for total of 5 to 6 days.Freeze Note: The cake can be frozen on its lining paper as soon as cooled, wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and a layer of foil, for up to 1 month. Thaw for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature.                                                    From Nigella Kitchen by Nigella Lawson. Copyright 2010 Nigella Lawson. Published by Hyperion.

Spread the tomatoes in an even layer on a small baking sheet.  Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Stir to evenly coat.  Roast in the oven for 15 minutes until the tomatoes begin to wilt.  Lay the tortillas out onto a large baking sheet.  Divide the olive oil evenly among the tortillas and spread evenly with a pastry brush.  Bake in the 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly browned and crisp.  Remove from the oven and set aside.  Meanwhile, heat a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and cook, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is crisp and the fat is rendered.  Remove the pancetta and set aside, reserving the drippings in the pan.To the pancetta drippings, add the onions and a pinch of salt.  Cook on medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes or until caramelized and very soft.  While the onions are cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add 1 teaspoon of olive oil, and the mushrooms.  Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes, until the mushrooms begin to soften.  Remove from heat and set aside.  To assemble the pizzas:Lay about 1/2 cup baby spinach leaves on top of the crisped tortillas.  Top with 1/4 of each:  cooked pancetta: cooked mushrooms: caramelized onions; roasted tomatoes; goat cheese; pecans.
