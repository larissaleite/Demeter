Brush olive oil on each circle and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture.Bake 13 minutes or until done.Using the 1-1/2 inch circle cutter cut cheese into rounds, slice beef and cut peppers into small pieces.  Once the biscuits are done and cooled stack your sandwiches.  Start with the top biscuit round.  Using the sharp end of the skewer poke through the round and bring it up to the top.  Now add an olive, cheese, pepper, meat, biscuit round, cheese, pepper, meat and the last biscuit round.  TIP:  Hold the skewer straight up, lay the biscuit on the counter and poke down the center NOT through but to the bottom.  Bring down the other ingredients and press together.  This will help it hold together.  This will make 18 appetizers WITHOUT using the scraps of biscuit dough.
