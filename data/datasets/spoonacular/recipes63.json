Lightly mist a 9- or 10-inch pie pan with spray oil.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, pecan flour, sweetener, and baking powder and whisk until well mixed. Add the butter, milk and vanilla and stir with a large spoon for 1 to 2 minutes. The dough will be stiff and playdough-like.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Put the dough in the prepared pan and lightly mist the top of the dough with spray oil. Spread the dough with your fingers, pressing it in an even layer to line the pan. Prick the bottom and sides with a fork to help prevent bubbles and air pockets.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Cover the edges with aluminum foil, then bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake for 7 minutes, then remove the foil and bake an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough is firm to the touch and just starting to brown.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            For the Filling: Have the piecrust ready. In a heavy sauce pan, combine the milk and half of the Splenda and cook over medium-high heat until almost simmering.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Meanwhile, combine the eggs, the remaining Splenda, and the almond flour and whisk until thoroughly blended. Ladle about one-fourth of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Then, ladle in another one-fourth of the hot milk and whisk to combine; this will gradually heat the eggs without curdling them.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Lower the heat to medium, pour in the egg mixture, and whisk until thoroughly blended. Switch to a wooden spoon and cook, stirring slowly and constantly to prevent burning and keep the eggs from curdling. As soon as the mixture is nearly simmering, with steady but gentle bubbling throughout, remove from the heat. The mixture will thicken slightly, but not as much as a traditional pastry cream; it will be more like gravy. Add the butter, vanilla, and liquid stevia and whisk gently until the butter melts and disappears into the mixture. If the mixture seems grainy or lumpy, whisk until smooth. If it curdles, don\u2019t worry, just whisk out the lumps as best you can.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Let the mixture cool until you can touch the outside of the pot for more than 5 seconds.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Sprinkle in the gelatin and whisk to distribute it evenly. It won\u2019t dissolve completely at first, but as the custard cools the gelatin will soften and begin to firm up the custard. Place a piece of plastic wrap tightly over the top of the saucepan to prevent the custard from forming a skin. After about 30 minutes, when the custard is just slightly warm to the touch, put it in the refrigerator until completely cooled. Remove it from the refrigerator and whisk or use an electric hand mixer to whip the filling until it becomes fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour it into the prebaked pie shell, spreading it in an even layer. Mist the surface with spray oil, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 2 hours.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Variation: Coconut Cream Pie Lightly toast 3/4 cup (2.25 oz / 64 g) of unsweetened shredded dried coconut (see Tip, page 150). Reserve 2 tablespoons of the coconut and whisk the rest into the custard after it cools; in addition to providing texture, flavor, and fiber, this will fluff up the custard nicely. Proceed as directed in the recipe. After you garnish the pie with whipped cream, sprinkle the reserved coconut evenly over the top.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/vanilla-cream-pie-205204", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 180, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simply Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pasta-with-Tuna-and-Capers-in-White-Wine-Sauce-247192.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 247192, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Pasta with Tuna and Capers in White Wine Sauce", "creditText": "Simply Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 (6-ounce) can tuna packed in olive oil, drained", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "canned tuna", "metaInformation": ["packed in olive oil, drained", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tuna-canned.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 15119, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp capers", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "capers", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/capers.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2054, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "Pinch chili pepper flakes", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili flakes", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1032009, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup dry white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 14106, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "flat leaf parsley", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11297, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbsp olive oil (plus more)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["plus more)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 medium onion, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["medium", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 ounces bow tie (farfalle), linguini, or spaghetti pasta", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "spaghetti pasta", "metaInformation": ["(farfalle)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11420420, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/pasta_with_tuna_and_capers_in_white_wine_sauce/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 14, "aggregateLikes": 627, "instructions": "1 Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 teaspoon for every quart of water), return to a boil.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, about 12 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely.Photograph by Kana Okada

Make the Dough: Place the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Stir on medium-low speed for a minute or so to combine. Add the egg, milk, vanilla and butter and mix on medium speed until a smooth dough forms, about 5 minutes. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a draft-free area until doubled in volume (about 1 hour). While the dough rests, make the fillings and streusel.2. Make the Apricot Filling: Combine the dried apricots, orange juice, lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the apricots soften and the liquid is reduced by half. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. Once cool, transfer the mixture to a food processor and process until a puree forms. Set aside at room temperature.3. Make the Cream Cheese Filling: In a medium bowl, stir the cream cheese and sugar with a wooden spoon until smooth and lump-free. Add the egg yolk, vanilla extract and salt, and stir to combine. Set aside at room temperature.4. Make the Streusel: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugars and salt. Add the butter and mix with a rubber spatula until the mixture comes together into large, coarse crumbs. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 5. Assemble the Babka: Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan; set aside.6. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 10x24-inch rectangle, with the long edge facing you. Spread the apricot filling evenly over the dough, leaving a \u00bd-inch border along all of the edges. Spread the cream cheese filling over the apricot filling. 7. Starting with the bottom edge, roll the dough into the middle of the rectangle, then do the same with the top edge so that the two rolls meet in the center. Visualize the long cylinder divided into three equal lengths. Fold the left third over onto the middle third. Then, fold the right third over the middle third. Pick up the dough and turn it over so the seam is on the bottom. Then, holding each end, gently twist it in the middle and place it in the prepared pan. 8. Whisk together the egg and salt for the egg wash and brush it over the babka. Lightly cover the pan with plastic wrap and place it in a draft-free area until it is doubled in size, 1\u00bd to 2 hours. 9. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the babka once again with the egg wash and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top, pressing lightly so the crumbs adhere to the babka. Bake until the top is a deep golden brown, about 50 minutes. Cool the bread in the pan set on a wire rack for 25 minutes, then unmold the bread from the pan (some of the streusel may fall off) and place on the wire rack to cool completely. The bread will keep, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/apricot-cream-cheese-babka-507752", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

When cool, use an apple corer to remove the center and prepare for filling (see how to do this [here|http://rosebakes.com/chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-cupcakes-oh-my-goodness/).To make the filling (if you're not using pre-made), add the butter, brown sugar and milk to a small saucepan.  Heat until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves, about 3-5 minutes over medium heat.  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.   Allow to cool slightly and it will start to thicken.  Spoon it into the cupcake holes.For the frosting, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and add in the brown sugar and cream.  Heat until it boils, then remove it from the heat and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Slowly add in the confectioners sugar while mixing.  Add the vanilla.

Whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook until the mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes.Remove the wings from the oven and brush with the sauce. Using a metal spatula, toss to coat well. Return the tray to the oven and cook an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until glazed and cooked through. Toss the cooked wings to coat well and serve.

You want to make sure your kernels have enough room and aren\u2019t sitting on top of each other. If you feel they will be too crowded, make it in batches. Pour in enough oil to fill the entire bottom. Add your kernels and shake until they are coated. If your kernels don\u2019t move easily when the pan is shaken, you may need to add a little more oil (don\u2019t use too much though!). Turn the heat on. Shake the pan every so often so the kernels move around a bit. After what seems like forever, a kernel should pop. Once that happens, add your lid because they will fly everywhere. Once the noise dies down, remove the pan from the heat. Pour into a giant bowl and let cool for a bit. Now sift through the kernels. I literally took a handful, took out any unpopped kernels, burnt pieces, etc. and placed the good stuff in a 13\u00d79 pan (which is what you bake the popcorn in). Although this may seem tedious, you will regret it later because the caramel popcorn clumps together. Imagine eating a nice chunk of popcorn, just to find an unpopped kernel mixed in.Preheat oven to 250F. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add sugar, corn syrup, and molasses; stir gently to mix. Stir occasionally until it starts to boil. Bring the mixture to 240F (if you don\u2019t have a thermometer, you can use the soft-ball stage test). Remove the pan from the heat and stir in salt, baking soda, and vanilla. Pour caramel over the popcorn and fold until all of the popcorn is coated.Bake for 15 minutes. Stir the popcorn then bake for another 20 minutes. Let cool then break into pieces.
