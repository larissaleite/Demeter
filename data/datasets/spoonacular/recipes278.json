Using a sharp knife (or a mandoline or food processor), slice the fennel crosswise as thinly as you can\u2014about 1/16 inch is ideal. (Too thick and it will dominate the salad; too thin and it wilt and lose its texture.) Transfer to a bowl and drizzle with half the dressing. Toss, taste, and add salt and pepper as needed. Divide the fennel among the 4 plates, mounding in the center of the orange slices.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Halve the avocado lengthwise, remove the pit, and cut 1/4-inch slices into the flesh. Using a large spoon, scoop the slices out and nestle them on and around the mounds of fennel. Sprinkle a little salt over the avocado and then drizzle the remaining vinaigrette all over the salad.

Once it reaches 200F, maintain the oven temperature for 10 minutes. Then, turn off the heat.Meanwhile, heat the milk and sugar together in a small bowl in the microwave until the mixture is lukewarm. Whisk in the yeast and egg and set aside.Combine 4 cups of the flour and the salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at the lowest speed to combine, about 15 seconds. With the mixer still on low, add the liquid in a steady stream and mix until the flour is moist, about 1 minute. With the mixer still running, slowly add the 8 tbsp of softened butter until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the dough is thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Replace the paddle with a dough hook and knead on medium speed until smooth, about 6 minutes. Add more flour in 1 tbsp increments until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl. Scrape the dough out of the mixing bowl and into a large oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the warmed oven to rise for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.Once the dough has doubled, punch in down and replace the plastic wrap. Let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 3 tbsp of butter. With a pastry brush, butter the bottom and sides of a large rimmed baking sheet. with half of the butter.Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape until each piece is 18 inches long and about 1 inches across. With a bench scraper, cut each dough log into 8 evenly sized pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a smooth, tight ball. Flatten the dough into a rough oval. Lightly brush with melted butter, then fold in half and gently seal the edges. Place the roll on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining balls of dough.Lightly brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining butter and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.When the rolls are almost fully risen, heat oven to 375F. Bake rolls until the tops are dark golden brown, about 20-22 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.
