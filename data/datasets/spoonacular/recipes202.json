Cover the entire cake with a thin layer of frosting (don't use all of it just yet), enough to capture possible crumbs (you should still see some of the cake peeking through). Refrigerate the cake 15 minutes.Finish frosting the whole cake with the remaining frosting. Pull out the parchment paper strips and discard. Refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.
