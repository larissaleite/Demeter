Remove from the heat and either transfer to a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low for a minute or so to allow to cool slightly. Add the first egg and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides and add the remaining eggs one at a time, stirring till each egg is incorporated.When dough is glossy and smooth, spoon rounded teaspoonfuls into 360F oil (in a deep fryer or at least 2-3\" in a pot over medium low heat).Balls will float to the surface and turn themselves over. Allow to fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. (Do not remove too soon as undercooked crullers will deflate and be very sad). Dip or brush on glaze while still warm.

You will know when they are done cooking when you can poke the outside skin and it \u2018gives\u2019 a bit.Now you can either cook your chicken at the same time or after the squash is done cooking. Whatever you\u2019d like. Just place chicken on a foil or parchment paper lined baking sheet, sprinkle some olive oil over the chicken (or other kind of fat), salt and pepper it, and sprinkle just a bit of basil on top. Easy peasy. I cooked my tenders for around 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. Keep that sh*t moist bro.Once your squash is done cooking, pull it out of the oven, dethread the spaghetti squash into a large bowl with a fork. Go against the grain, if spaghetti squash had grain.Now throw your diced bacon into a skillet and cook until done. Use a slotted spoon to pull out your cooked bacon, but leave behind the grease.Take your delicata squash and hollow it out. Unless you want to eat the skin, be my guest. If you\u2019re smart though, you\u2019ll just use the insides and dump them into your warm skillet filled with bacon grease. Then add your coconut milk. You may need to add a little bit more coconut milk depending on how runny you like your sauce. Mix thoroughly with a ladle to break up the squash a bit. I used a pink ladle. It works the best.Add seasonings to the mix and salt and pepper as needed. Mix thoroughly and cook on low for about 5 minutes to simmer.Now dice up your cooked chicken.Pour sauce over spaghetti squash and add your chicken to the mix.Mix well.Top with bacon.
