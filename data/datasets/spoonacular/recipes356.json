In a mixing bowl stir together, spinach, ricotta, egg, parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of the mozzarella, the asiago and Romano cheese. To assemble lasagna roll ups:Spread 1/4 cup (barely heaping) of the cheese mixture evenly along length of the noodles. Roll noodles up jelly roll style to opposite end. Pour about 1 cup of the marinara sauce into the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Place lasagna roll ups in baking dish then cover tops with remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Place the salmon on a sheet pan, skin side down. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until just cooked. Remove from the oven and cover tightly with aluminum foil.

Cool to room temperature.Break the bread slices in pieces and process the bread in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. You should have about 1 cup of bread crumbs. Place the bread crumbs on a sheet pan and toast in the oven for 5 minutes until lightly browned, tossing occasionally.Flake the chilled salmon into a large bowl. Add the bread crumbs, mayonnaise, mustard, and eggs. Add the vegetable mixture and mix well. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
