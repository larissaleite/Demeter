Halfway through, turn chicken over and re-coat the chicken with the liquid.5) Prep your orange and ginger. Add into the cavity of the chicken. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. 6) Once your oven is hot, stick in your bird and set your timer for 20 minutes. If the bottom of your pan is dry, meaning that all the glaze has cooked down, add about 1/3 Cup water to your pan andscrape up the glaze so it liquefies again. 7) Cooking until chicken reaches 165 degrees (remember the chicken will rise 5  10 degrees while resting outside your oven), about an hour. Baste chicken ever 20 minutes.8) Cover loosely with foil and let your meat rest about 10 minutes before you start slicing into it. That will give the juices some time to redistribute throughout the meat. If you dont do this, your meat will be alot dryer. And nobody likes dry meat people.9) Then you can slice up the pieces for serving! 10) Take your carcass from the bird and add it to a pot of cold water with a few ribs of celery, an onion cut into quarters, a few carrots, a bulb of garlic cut open horizontally, 20 or so black peppercorns,a few sprigs of thyme or rosemary or parsley (or all three) and a pinch of salt.11) Bring this to a boil and then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 2 hours covered. 12) Strain out the veggies and chicken and youll be left with enough delicious stock for many meals. You can keep it in the fridge for a week or freeze it for future use.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/five-spice-roasted-chicken-537779", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": true, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Rants from my Crazy Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chicken-Pot-Pie-512816.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 50, "id": 512816, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chicken Pot Pie", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Rants from my Crazy Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup sliced carrots", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11124, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup sliced celery", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "celery", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11143, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups chicken broth (I used home-made stock, you may want to add salt in with the pepper, the stock had enough flavor that it didn't need it.)", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": ["with the pepper, the stock had enough flavor that it didn't need it.)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1022020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup frozen green peas", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peas", "metaInformation": ["green", "frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11304, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups cooked and shredded chicken", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "shredded chicken", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rotisserie-chicken.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 5348, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 ( 9 inch) unbaked pie crusts", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "unbaked pie crusts", "metaInformation": ["( )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg", "unitLong": "9-inchs", "unitShort": "9-inch", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18334, "unit": "9-inch"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 88.0, "sourceUrl": "http://rantsfrommycrazykitchen.com/2012/05/15/chicken-pot-pie/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "aggregateLikes": 5153, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

While the dough rises roast the garlic and make the pesto.Preheat oven to 375. Chop off the top portion of the garlic head to reveal cloves. Peel any excess paper/skin off from the bulb of garlic. Pour about a teaspoon of olive oil on top the garlic cloves and cover with foil and roast in a baking dish for 45 minutes, or until golden brown and soft. Allow to cool and then squeeze garlic out of the paper skin into a small bowl, set aside.Place the cilantro, parsley, mint, jalapeo, garlic and cashews in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times until well chopped. Stream in the olive oil and pulse until combined. Add the feta and pulse a few more times or until combined.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.In a large bowl add the zucchini, pepper and drained artichokes. Add 1 teaspoon olive oil, the smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, turmeric, and a pinch of pepper. Toss really well making sure the spices are evenly coating the veggies and there are no clumps. Set aside.Once the pizza dough is ready to go, divide the dough in half. Place half the dough aside for another use (or make 2 pizzas) or freeze for later. With the remaining dough roll/press into one 10 to 12 inch round circle or rectangle (you may go smaller or larger depending on how thick you want your crust). Top with as much of the pesto as desired and then sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese. Add the veggies in an even layer. Then sprinkle on the olives and half the feta cheese.Bake at 375 degrees for 30 - 35 minutes or until your desired doneness.

Add the flour and cornstarch and beat for about a minute. The dough will be dry. I like to use my hands to press it all together.Press the dough into the prepared baking dish and bake for about 20 -25 minutes. The edges will be golden but the shortbread will be pale in color. Take it out and let it cool completely.While the shortbread bakes, pour the water into a 2 quart saucepan. Add the sugar (make a pile of sugar right in the center of the pan and keep it off the sids because it will crystallize and your caramel will have chunks in it). Cover it and bring it to a boil.Once it boils (will only take about 3 mins), remove the lid and drop the heat a little. Let it continue to simmer for awhile. You're looking for that pretty amber caramel color - I got the color I wanted at 23 minutes.Place the pan in the sink.Heat the cream just a little-- you don't wanna scald it. I do mine on the stove but you could microwave it for a few seconds. You want WARM cream. Think like hot dish water temperature (I touch it to test).Pour the cream into the pan you set in the sink. It will bubble and foam and go crazy. It's fine. Stir stir stir for a minute and it will settle down.Add the vanilla. Stir some more until the texture is smooth and the color is even. If you feel like your mixture is way too thick, you can heat just a tad more cream and add it. But this caramel WILL thicken upon cooling and you want it to set up so the less cream, the better.Pour the caramel over the cooled shortbread. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes.Place the Hershey slices on top of the caramel.To slice, lift the parchment from the pan, place the cookie bars on the counter, and cut into squares. *** I find these much easier to cut when frozen because the caramel isn't sticky. It might be helpful to freeze these bars for 30 minutes or so and then cut them.***These are best kept refrigerated-- it makes them a little less messy.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

                            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans.Using an electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy. Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6 to 8 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour and coconut milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Add vanilla and continue to beat until just mixed. Divide batter equally among prepared pans. Level batter in each pan by holding pan 3 or 4-inches above counter, then dropping it flat onto counter. Do this several times to release air bubbles and assure you of a more level cake. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cool in pans 5 to 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto cooling racks.                                                Filling:                                        Stir together sugar, sour cream, milk, and coconut in a bowl until well blended. Add first cake layer onto pedestal. Using the wrong end of a wooden spoon, poke holes approximately 1-inch apart until entire cake has been poked. Spread a third of filling mixture on cake layer. Top with second layer, repeat process. Top with last layer and repeat process again.Cook's Note: As each layer is stacked, stick them with toothpicks to prevent cake from shifting.                                                Frosting:                                        Place sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, salt, water, and egg whites in the top of a double boiler. Beat with a handheld electric mixer for 1 minute. Place pan over boiling water, being sure that boiling water does not touch the bottom of the top pan. Beat constantly on high speed with electric mixer for 7 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Sprinkle top and sides of cake with coconut. Garnish with artificial holly, if desired.

Cover and refrigerate while you make shortcakes.  Preheat oven to 350.  In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt. Cut cold butter into pieces and, using a pastry blender or a fork, cut the butter into the flour mixture until crumbly.  Whisk together cream and egg. Pour into flour/butter bowl and stir. Put the dough onto a work surface and lightly knead until it comes together enough to work with, but don't overwork it or shortcakes will become tough.  Roll or pat the dough into 1/2-3/4 inch thickness. Cut with biscuit cutters, cookie cutters, or a knife into the shape you desire (circles and squares are the most common). You should be able to get 6 biscuit-sized shortcakes. Place shortcakes onto a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes or until bottoms are golden and biscuits are cooked through. Carefully remove to a cooling rack.  In the bowl of a stand mixer, with the whisk attachment, pour cream and whisk on medium-high speed until stiff peaks are just achieved.  Turn off mixer and add Nutella. Resume whisking on low speed until Nutella is just incorporated, scraping sides and bottom of bowl, being careful not to over whip.  With a straight-edged knife, slice shortcakes in half. Place bottom onto serving plate and top with a generous amount of the whipped cream and strawberries (don't forget a little of the juice). Top with the top of the cake and add a little more cream and strawberries.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/nutella-cream-strawberry-shortcake-519712", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lifes Ambrosia", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sweet-chili-popcorn-chicken-693207.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 693207, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sweet Chili Popcorn Chicken", "preparationMinutes": 375, "creditText": "Lifes Ambrosia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup all purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "all purpose flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "dry bread crumbs", "metaInformation": ["plain", "dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "granulated garlic", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "oil for frying (such as avocado or canola)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": ["for frying", "(such as avocado or canola)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "panko bread crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/panko.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10018079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "rice vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1022053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pound (about 2) boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into bite size pieces", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breasts", "metaInformation": ["diced", "boneless", "skinless", "( 2)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1055062, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "soy sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16124, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sweet chili sauce (or Sweet Thai Chili Sauce)", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sweet chili sauce", "metaInformation": ["(or Sweet Thai Chili Sauce)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fish-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 98962, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 74.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2015/12/sweet-chili-popcorn-chicken-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "aggregateLikes": 115, "instructions": "Whisk together sweet chili sauce, soy sauce and vinegar.

your fingers to spread the seeds throughout. Bring milk, cream, and half of the sugar to a boil. Whisk the rest of the sugar with the yolks. Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture. Whisk the tempered yolks back into the remaining cream and strain through a fine sieve or chinois. Chill. Process the ice cream in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. When done, fold the grape jelly into the ice cream. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.To make the cookies, first melt butter, add oats and cook over medium heat until toasted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Chill. Cream the butter, baking soda, salt, and sugars until fluffy. Add peanut butter. Add oats, then flour on low speed. Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out desired shapes and place on sheet pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.To make the filling, cream all the ingredients together and chill. Spread filling on 1 cooled cookie, and top with another cookie to sandwich together. Continue for the rest of the cookies. Serve with a scoop of grape jelly ice cream.

rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Brush an 8-inch springform pan with a light coating of canola oil.Puree the mango and passion fruit juice in a food processor until smooth. Add the cream cheese and continue to process until smooth. Then add the sugar, yogurt, and cornstarch, pulsing to combine. Then add the eggs, lime zest and juice and pulse to combine. Take care not to overmix the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake the cheesecake until the outside of the cake is set but the center is still a little loose, about 45 minutes. Turn the oven off and open the door to let out some heat. Close door and continue to cook the cheesecake in the residual heat in the oven for 20 minutes. This gentle finish minimizes the risk of the dreaded crack in your cheesecake. Run a knife around the edges and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile make the topping: Put about half of the passion fruit juice and all the lime juice in a medium bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the surface. Don't stir. Set aside until the gelatin \"blooms\", about 1 minute. Boil the remaining passion fruit juice and all of the sugar in a small saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Whisk the hot juice into the gelatin mixture until smooth. Refrigerate until just begins to set, about 20 minutes. Stir in the fresh passion fruit pulp and seeds and pour over the top of the cooled cheesecake. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. To make mango coulis: Puree the passion fruit juice, mango, lime juice, and sugar in a food processor. Bring cheesecake to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Remove the springform ring. To serve, dip a knife in warm water, wipe dry before slicing each piece. Serve with mango coulis.Copyright 2007 Television Food Network, G.P.

avocado and goat cheese with a fork until evenly combined and set aside.Using your hands, form 6 even-sized patties with the ground beef. This is crucial because you are going to use two patties to form each burger.Scoop avocado and goat cheese filling onto 3 of the patties taking care to leave room around the edges. This is so you can seal the burgers on each side.Seal the burgers by placing the remaining patties on top and pinching the edges around the filling.Season the outside of the stuffed burgers with salt and pepper.Grill burgers on high heat for 4-5 minutes per side or until desired doneness is achieved.Serve over organic mixed greens and Sriracha Dipping SauceAdd all ingredients to a small mixing container like a mason jar or similar and blend using an immersion blender. The immersion blender will emulsify ingredients into a mayo.Enjoy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/avocado-goat-cheese-stuffed-burgers-with-sriracha-dipping-sauce-602016", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cooking Classy", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Brownie-Sandwich-Cookies-with-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Dough-Frosting-543365.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 13, "id": 543365, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Brownie Sandwich Cookies with Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Frosting", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Cooking Classy", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 tsp baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18372, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup packed dark-brown sugar*", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dark brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10019334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "Frosting!", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "frosting", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/frosting-or-icing.png", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 18.0, "id": 19230, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 -
