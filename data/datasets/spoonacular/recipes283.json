With machine running, pour up to  cup very cold water through the ice-filled feed tube a tablespoon at a time until dough just comes together and begins to pull cleanly away from the sides of the bowl in jagged clumps. Dont let the machine run too long and dont worry if you dont use all the water. Overworked dough and/or too much water are the main culprits in pastry that is tough or dense. However, in warm weather or dry climates you may need up to an additional 2 tablespoons more cold water. Youll learn to know when its the right balance of wet and dry.Move the dough to a lightly-floured work surface and gently knead 2 or 3 times. If the dough seems quite sticky or at all wet, sprinkle in another few teaspoons flour. Give dough another couple of quick, gentle kneads. Divide dough in half, shape into 2 discs one about 6-inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick, the other about 4-inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick; wrap discs in plastic.

Set the mushroom mixture, the pizza sauce, the grated cheese, and the pepperoni on a table near the grill. Prepare enough coals for a hot charcoal fire, or preheat your gas grill on high for 10 minutes with the lid closed.9. While the grill is getting hot, generously dust a metal pizza tray or the back of a sheet pan with cornmeal. Also generously dust your clear counter area with flour. Using a rolling pin and working from the center, roll out one ball of dough into a 12-inch circle.10. Transfer the dough to a pizza tray or the back of the sheet pan, making sure there is enough cornmeal to allow it to slide easily. Repeat with the other 3 pieces of dough, placing each one on a separate tray. When the coals are ready or the gas grill is hot, bring one of the pizza trays to the grill and slide the dough onto the center of the grill grate. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn over and immediately spoon a layer of sauce over the crust. Add some of the cheese, then some of the mushroom mixture, then some of the pepperoni.11. Continue grilling for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the crust is cooked through (this may happen before the cheese melts completely\u2014but that\u2019s okay).12. Bring the pizza tray close to the gril and slide the pizza on it. Transfer to a large cutting board. Use a pizza wheel to cut it into 6 pieces, and then transfer the slices to a large plate while you start working on the next pizza.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
