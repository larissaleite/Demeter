Mix everything together with a fork. It should be loose, but if you press on it, it should clump together.2) Start loading crust into springform pan. Use a measuring cup to press down the crumbs. Work around the edge with the measuring cup until all the edges are about the same thickness and pressed firmly together. Work slowly and make sure it is all really packed down well. Its very important to have a good sturdy crust.3) Bake this crust in a 350 degree oven for 8-10 minutes. Then let it cool completely on a wire rack. It should harden up nicely as it cools.4) For filling, beat together cream cheese and sugars. Once they are well incorporated and light, add the eggs and pumpkin (be sure to buy 100% pumpkin and not the pumpkin pie filling). Mix that all together and then add all other ingredients.5) Once pie crust has cooled down, you can pour filling into crust!6) Set pie pan on a large baking sheet and then pour 1 Cup of boiling water around the pan right before sticking it in the oven to create a water bath.7) Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until the center barely wiggles when you tap the side.8) Cool the pie to room temperature on a wire rack and then refrigerate it for at least 4 hours.9) Whisk all the whip cream ingredients together and then dollop it on top!", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

You can do this ahead of time. It's a great idea to keep some roasted garlic on hand. It's absolutely delicious in simple recipes like this one and gives so much great flavor to a dish. You can also mix some up with flavored butter and make some INCREDIBLE garlic bread. Which would taste great with this recipe too.To roast the garlic, cut off the top of the head of garlic, exposing the cloves. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil and wrap it in parchment paper and then wrap the parchment in aluminum foil. Place in a 400 degrees Fahrenheit oven and roast for about 45 minutes - an hour until the garlic is soft and slightly golden. Store it wrapped tightly in the refrigerator. When you are ready to use it, squeeze out the garlic out of the papery encasement.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to how done you like it. Save 1 cup of the pasta water. While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, you will prepare the sauce.Bring the chicken broth and white wine to a boil in a large skillet.Add the roasted garlic, red pepper flakes and anchovies to the skillet. Whisk vigorously, breaking apart the garlic and the anchovies.Add the cooked turkey or chicken to the skillet and cook just for a minute to heat it up.Add the nutmeg, Parmesan cheese and the cream to the skillet. Cook for a few minutes, just until the sauce thickens up slightly.Add the cooked pasta to the skillet along with the fresh herbs. Mix to combine.Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Pour in some of the reserved pasta water to loosen up the sauce if it needs it. I always add pasta water to this sauce. It may seem watery at first but the pasta will really soak up the sauce, so don't worry if it looks a little loose at first.

Beat until you do not see any streaks of butter and the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined. Cover and place in the fridge well you make the crackers.Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Put the flour, baking powder, sugar, and 1/2 tsp of salt in the food processor. Pulse to combine. Add the cold butter and pulse to combine. Add in the canola oil and pulse to combine. Stream in the water until a dough ball forms. Roll the dough out as thin as you can. (I actually used my pasta maker and it worked really well. I went to the second setting) Use a cookie cutter to cut the dough out into bunnies or circles or really anything you want! Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-11 minutes. The tops wil begin to turn golden.Remove from the oven and brush with the melted butter and then sprinkle with kosher salt. Allow to cool completely (this only takes about 5 minutes) before filling with the peanut butter.Once the crackers have cooled, use a knife to spread the peanut butter filling on one side and then sandwich with another cracker. Repeat until all the crackers have been used. I had a total of 18 sandwiches (36 crackers). Place the crackers in the freezer for about 10 minutes.In the meantime melt the chocolate in a shallow microwave safe bowl. Melt on high for 30 second intervals stirring each time until melted.Line a baking sheet with wax or parchment paper. Remove three sandwiches from the freezer and dip in the melted chocolate. Use a knife to wipe off any excess chocolate and place on the baking sheet. If you would like to decorate these with sprinkle, do so now. Repeat until you have covered one side of all the sandwiches. After you have done all the sandwiches place them back in the freezer for anther 10 minutes. Remove and dip the other side in the melted chocolate. Place back on the baking sheet and use a knife to fill in the sides or any other blank spots. Place back in the freezer for another 10 minutes. Remove from the freezer and store in a sealed container, until ready to serve.

Begin by seasoning the burgers with salt and pepper. Heat a saute pan over medium heat until hot. Sear off the burger patties to medium rare, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a sheet pan and cool to room temperature.Assemble the sandwiches with the Swiss cheese and Cheddar slices divided among half of the bread slices and the caramelized onions and beef patties divided among the other half of the slices. Combine 1 slice of each kind to create a sandwich.Heat a 12-inch skillet to medium and melt 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) of the butter into the pan per sandwich. Add in a sandwich and press with a steak weight or another pan to press all the ingredients together and warm and melt the cheese. Flip the sandwich and repeat until golden brown and the cheeses are melting. Repeat with each sandwich until complete.Cut in half and serve with salad or French fries.

Heat mixture over medium heat until butter melts, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and stir in buttermilk and vegetable oil (this should bring mixture down to 105-110 degrees, if not allow mixture to cool to 105-110 degrees). Pour milk mixture into the bowl of an electric stand mixer and using whisk attachment, stir in yeast. Allow mixture to rest 5 minutes, then add 1/2 cup granulated sugar, salt, vanilla, egg and egg yolk. Stir mixture until blended. Switch mixer to a hook attachment, then add 3 1/2 cups of the bread flour and knead mixture on low speed until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes (dough will be sticky). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size about 1 1/2 - 2 hours. In a small mixing bowl, using a fork, whisk together 3/4 cup light-brown sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder and nutmeg, set aside. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together remaining 1/4 cup bread flour, cornstarch and baking powder. Pour flour mixture over risen dough and return to stand mixer and knead mixture, using the hook attachment, until smooth and elastic (resist the urge to add more flour, dough should be slightly sticky). Roll dough out on a  lightly floured surface to a 16 x 12 inch rectangle. Using the back of a spoon, spread 1/3 cup melted butter evenly over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture over melted butter, coming within a 1/2 inch of all edges, and spread into an even layer. Starting on the 16 inch side, roll dough up snugly to opposite end. Cut dough into 12 equal pieces (its easiest to cut in half, then cut halves into halves, then cut those halves into thirds). Arrange rolls in a buttered 13 x 9 inch baking dish, then cover dish with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled in size about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (you can do this during the last 10 minutes of rising). Bake rolls in preheated oven for 23 - 26 minutes until golden brown.

Grease three 8-inch pans (or do as I did if you don\u2019t have three and just use one of them twice) and set aside.In a medium bowl sift together flour, sugar, cocoa, soda and salt, and set aside.In the large bowl of a standing mixer, whisk together, by hand, the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla until combined, and then whisk in the melted butter. With the bowl under the paddle attachment running at a low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and continue to beat until smooth, about 2 minute. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in boiling water with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very loose.Pour the batter evenly between the three 8-inch pans and bake for about 35 minutes, until a toothpick or fork inserted in the center comes out with just a few steaming crumbs attached.Allow to cool to room temperature. If combining with the Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse Frosting, wrap entirely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours (or overnight) until completely cold.In a medium sauce pan, heat chocolate and heavy cream on medium-high heat, whisking constantly until it reaches a boil. Turn down to a low boil and continue whisking for another minute. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Quickly stir in the hazelnut extract and Nutella. Let cool completely to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap so that it\u2019s directly touching the frosting, and put in the freezer and leave it in the freezer overnight. It should be very thick, but not unworkable.To Assemble the Cake:Just before spreading, gently whisk the frosting only until it\u2019s spreadable. (You can use a wooden spoon if the frosting is too thick initially for the whisk.) Place each of the three cake layers side-by-side and frost just the tops with even portions of the frosting, heaping it toward the middle of each layer. Place the first layer on the desired serving stand and then stack the second and the third directly on top to create a three-layer cake.

Season to taste with crushed red pepper, if desired.Carefully crack 2 eggs into each ramekin (to be safe, crack into a saucer first to prevent broken yolks). Season with black pepper. Bake 15-20 minutes, or until the egg white are just set. Sprinkle with feta; broil 3-5 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown and the eggs are cooked to you liking.Serve with warm bread to sop up the extra sauce.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the short ribs are falling off the bone. If at any time the liquid level is low in the pot, add a little stock or more cider. You can do this ahead of time! Once the ribs are cooked, remove and let cool until you can tough. Pull the meat from the bone. Note: about halfway through the ribs cook time is when I start the dough.doughIn a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas - this specific dough will yield one pizza large enough to feed about 3-4 people) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees. (If I use my pizza stone, I heat my oven to 475 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. If you're just using a baking sheet, follow the directions below for baking and set to 425 degrees.)crispy sprouts and shallotsHeat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add the olive oil and butter. Add in the onions with the sugar and stir to coat. Cook, stirring occaisonally, until the shallots are caramelized, about 15 minutes. Add in the brussels and stir to coat. Increase the heat to medium and cook until the brussels are bright green and crisp, about 5 more minutes. Add a pinch of salt and pepper if desired.Brush the pizza dough with the olive oil. Add a few handfuls of cheese to the dough, then cover liberally with the shallots, brussels and short ribs. Top with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25 to 30 minute (or a little less if using the stone) or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Remove and let cool slightly before serving. If desired, sprinkle a little parmesan cheese and fresh herbs on top.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/crispy-shredded-sprouts-cider-short-rib-and-caramelized-shallot-pizza-617264", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "For the Love of Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cucumber-and-Tomato-Salad-with-Garbanzo-Beans-and-Basil-497246.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 497246, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Cucumber and Tomato Salad with Garbanzo Beans and Basil", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "For the Love of Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 can of garbanzo beans, rinsed & drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned garbanzo beans", "metaInformation": ["rinsed", "drained"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg", "unitLong": "cans", "unitShort": "can", "amount": 0.5, "id": 16058, "unit": "can"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "Several cherry tomatoes, halved", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cherry tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["halved"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cherry-tomatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 10311529, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cucumbers", "metaInformation": ["diced", "peeled", "seeded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11206, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp feta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1019, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh basil", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 clove of garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp red onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "Sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea-salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp white balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "white balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1012069, "unit": "tbsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 33.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.fortheloveofcooking.net/2012/08/cucumber-and-tomato-salad-with-garbanzo-beans-and-basil.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 503, "instructions": "Combine the white balsamic vinegar, canola oil, olive oil, garlic, sugar, sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste, in a large bowl; whisk until well combined.

is black, turning as needed to cook all sides evenly. Wrap in foil and set aside to steam for 20 minutes. Remove from the foil and gently brush the skin off or rinse under warm water.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Pulse the walnuts in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl. Pulse the eggplant, tofu, and mushrooms into small pieces. Add mixture to the walnuts along with the remaining loaf ingredients. Mix together until evenly combined. Transfer the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart loaf pan or casserole dish and bake for 1 hour.For the gravy: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste. Scatter the flour over the mushrooms and stir until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add the marsala and broth and bring to a boil, cooking until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the cream and fresh thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper.Unmold the meatless loaf, slice, and serve with the mushroom gravy.Copyright 2004 Television Food Network, G.P.

Chill until ready to use.In a saucepan over medium-low heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the onion and saut, stirring, until soft, 3-5 minutes. Add the millet and toast until very lightly browned and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.Gently fluff the millet with a fork.

Add yeast, stir, & let the mixture rest until foamy; about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer add the butter, sugar, vanilla, 1 cup of the flour, salt, nutmeg, & lemon zest.  Use the paddle attachment & mix until crumbly.  Add the yeast/milk mixture & eggs.  Mix until combined.  Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft yet sticky dough.  (I used only 4 cups of flour total.)Switch to the dough hook & knead for 5 minutes, or until the dough is elastic & pliable.  Lightly grease the top of the dough with vegetable/canola oil, & turn the dough over so it's coated in oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel & let rise until nearly doubled; about 1 hour.While dough is rising combine the sugar, nutmeg, ginger, & lemon zest in a bowl so the zest has a chance to flavor the sugar.  Once the dough has risen, add just enough lemon juice to the sugar mixture form a thick clumpy mixture like wet sand (I used the whole 1/4 cup.)Lightly grease a jelly-roll pan with baking spray.  On a floured surface, pat the dough out into a large yet thick rectangle; about 10\"x15\".Spread the dough evenly with 3 Tbsp of very soft unsalted butter.  Then spread the lemon/sugar mixture over the top.  Roll the dough up tightly, starting from the top, long end.  Stretch & pull the dough taut as you roll, to keep the lemon-sugar firm inside.Cut rolls using floss or string about 1\" thick.  Place on the prepared baking sheet with ends inward to help keep from unrolling once they raise.  Cover the rolls with a towel (I like to use a LIGHTLY damp towel) & let raise for another hour or until puffy & nearly doubled.  Heat oven to 350*F.  Place risen rolls in the oven & bake for 20-25 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into a center roll reads 190*F. (You may also press the center to see if it springs back to determine the doneness; if it springs back, it's done.)  While rolls are baking prepare the glaze.  Using a hand mixer, beat cream cheese until light & fluffy in a medium sized bowl.  Add the powdered sugar, zest & half the lemon juice (2 Tbsp.)  Blend until smooth & creamy.  If you want a thinner glaze add the remaining 2 Tbsp lemon juice.  Top warm rolls with glaze.
