Set aside 2 tablespoons of the rub for the pork belly. Reserve remaining rub in an airtight container for another use.For the hash: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sprinkle the pork belly generously with salt and black pepper and place in a medium high-sided saute pan with a lid. Add the stock, cilantro sprigs and smashed garlic and bring to a simmer. Cover with the lid and transfer to the oven. Let the pork belly braise until really tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes. Uncover and let it cool to room temperature in the stock. Remove the pork, pat it dry and put it in a large shallow bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and place another bowl on top with a can of beans or tomatoes to weight it down. Chill for 8 hours and up to 24 hours.Remove the pork belly from the refrigerator and remove the skin. Cut the pork into 1/2-inch cubes. Toss the cubes in the 2 tablespoons jerk rub. Heat a few tablespoons of canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the pork and cook until golden brown and crispy. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon to a plated lined with paper towels.Add the onion, red pepper and poblano to the pork drippings in the pan and cook until soft. Add the chopped garlic and cilantro and cook for another minute. Add the sweet potatoes and more oil if needed. Season with salt and black pepper and cook the potatoes, pressing firmly with a spatula, until they are deep golden brown on the bottom. Add the pork, turn the potatoes and cook, pressing with the spatula, to brown the other side of the potatoes and heat the pork.Heat the butter in a nonstick or cast-iron pan over medium heat. Carefully crack the eggs into the pan and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Fry until the edges begin to set and the yolk is slightly firm. Flip them over and cook for another minute longer. Or, instead of flipping, cover the eggs with a lid for 1 to 2 minutes to \"baste\"; the yolk should still be runny. Divide the hash among 4 plates and top each with an egg. Drizzle with hot sauce and garnish with more cilantro.

Process the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until combined. Scatter the shortening over the top and process until the mixture has the texture of coarse sand, about 10 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the top and, using short pulses, process the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Transfer to a bowl.2. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture. Stir and press the dough together, using a stiff rubber spatula until the dough sticks together. If the dough does not come together, stir in the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.3. Divide the dough into two even pieces and flatten each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap the disks tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Let the chilled dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling it out and fitting one of the pieces into the bottom of a pie plate.  To make ahead: The dough can be refrigerated, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Let the frozen dough thaw on the countertop until malleable before rolling.Make the pie4. Roll one dough disk on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fold dough in quarters, then place dough point in center of 9-inch Pyrex regular or deep dish pie pan. Unfold dough. Gently press dough into sides of pan leaving portion that overhangs lip of pie plate in place. Refrigerate while preparing fruit.5. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Toss the apples with cup of the sugar, the flour, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and spices, and set aside.6. Roll out the top crust to a 12-inch circle. Spread the apples in the unbaked pie crust bottom, mounding them slightly in the middle. Loosely roll the top crust around the rolling pin, then gently unroll it over the apples. Trim all but 1/2-inch of the dough overhanging the edge of the pie plate with scissors. Seal the edge by pressing the top and bottom crusts together, then tuck the edges underneath. Crimp the edges, and cut four vent holes in the top. Brush the crust with the egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.7. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and lower the oven temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Bake until the top crust is golden, about 25 minutes.
