Spoon the chocolate-hazelnut spread into your blender. Add the chopped chocolate. Set your ramekins/cocottes/teacups/glasses on a baking sheet.In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, sugar, salt and egg yolks over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, 8 to 10 minutes; I like to use a flat-bottomed wooden spatula so that I can make sure the eggs aren't catching on the bottom and cooking. Cook until the custard thickens, resembling something like very thick paint. It should register between 175 and 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Another test: the custard should coat the back of the spatula, and when you draw a line across the back of the spatula with your (clean!) finger, the line should hold and maintain its edges without running. Remove from the heat immediately.Now, pour the warm custard through a strainer into the blender. Let it sit 5 minutes to melt the chocolate. Add the Sriracha, espresso powder if using and vanilla extract. Then, put the lid on the blender, hold down with a thick kitchen towel, and blend on low, then high, until smooth and combined, scraping down the sides if necessary. Taste for seasoning.Pour the custard into your containers, tapping them against the rim of the baking sheet to remove air bubbles. Pop them in the fridge and chill until the custards are set, 2 to 3 hours.Top with whipped cream or creme fraiche, some grated chocolate and minced hazelnuts.

Cook until the red onions and mushrooms are soft, about 5-10 minutes.Add the red wine and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.Cook until this mixture thickens and most of the liquid is evaporated.OPTIONAL // you may puree half of this mushroom mixture in a blender to make this gravy thick, or you may puree all, or none. Add back into the skillet.Stir in the vegetable broth, sage, thyme, and fresh rosemary.Add 1 tablespoon of the gluten free flour at a time while whisking in the flour until smooth.Bring the mixture to a boil followed by reducing the heat to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes or until thickened.Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter (optional) until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Garnish with fresh herbs.Pour into a gravy boat or bowl.Cut the cauliflower and potatoes into bite sized pieces, which allows for quicker steaming.Steam the cauliflower and potatoes for about 7-10 minutes or until soft in a steamer (or microwave if you don't have a steamer).Put everything into a high speed blender or food processor and pulse until everything is well combined.You have a lot of flexibility at this stage- you can pulse for a thicker, chunkier consistency, or you can puree for a very smooth texture, or in between.Taste as you go along and adjust your seasonings.Serve with Savory Mushroom and Herb Gravy or other toppings.Enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/savory-mushroom-and-herb-gravy-with-cauliflower-potato-mash-537910", "dishTypes": ["sauce"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Soup Addict", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Veggie-Burger-Sliders--Quick---Easy-557654.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 557654, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Veggie Burger Sliders \u2013 Quick & Easy", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 87.54, "creditText": "Soup Addict", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Cheese slices (I use both sharp cheddar and havarti)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cheese", "metaInformation": ["(I use both sharp cheddar and havarti)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "slice", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1041009, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "Olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 large onion, sliced into thin quarter moons", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["large", "sliced into thin quarter moons"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Hamburger pickle slices", "name": "pickle", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill-pickles.jpg", "unitLong": "slicesslice", "unitShort": "slicesslices", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011937, "unit": "slicesslices"}, {"originalString": "6 slider buns, sliced in half", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "slider buns", "metaInformation": ["sliced in half"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/slider-buns.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 93646, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Your favorite slider condiments, such as mustard, mayo, BBQ sauce, sriracha", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "slider buns", "metaInformation": [" such as mustard, mayo, bbq sauce, sriracha", "your favorite"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/slider-buns.png", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 93646, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "6 Veggie sausage patties (I use Morningstar Farms brand - usually in the frozen breakfast aisle.
