Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line pans with cupcake liners.2. Sift cake mix to remove any lumps and set aside.3. In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, milk sour cream and vanilla extract until smooth.4. Stir in cake mix.5. Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full and bake for 16-20 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean.6. Let cool.7. Eyes: Melt 1/3 Cup wafers (to use chocolate chips read the NOTE below) in a microwave proof bowl and stir until smooth.  Pour into a small plastic bag and seal.  Snip the corner off the bag to using as a mini piping bag.  Pipe small dollops about the size of your M&Ms onto parchment, foil or wax paper.  Depending on how hot your melts are, you may want to give they a few seconds to cool off, you don't want it to be TOO runny.  Then gently press an M&M into each \"white\" of the eyes.  You can use the blue, green and red candies too! The melts will harden quickly, so don't wait too long before putting the M&Ms on them.  Let cool (only will take 5 minutes).8. Buttercream: Beat butter for 2 minutes.  Add vanilla and peppermint extract.  Slowly add in powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.  Add green dye, as much as you want!  9.  To assemble (see photos below), pipe a swirl of frosting on top of each cupcake.  Use a knife or offset spatula to flatten the frosting.  Turn the cupcake upside down and press into a bowl/plate filled with chocolate Jimmy sprinkles.  Press on your eyes and use an extra sprinkle to make the nose.  Use chocolate chips or Tootsie rolls (I didn't have either on hand so I melted down some chocolate piped out little rectangles) to press into the sides as \"bolts.\"  Put on a little \"stitch\" (You can use red frosting, I used a gel dye to color my extra melts from the eyes and piped out stitches).

To glaze the border, brush it very lightly with a little milk and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar.Spread the crust with Raspberry Sauce; scatter pineapple, kiwi and strawberries (or cranberries) on top. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake until the crust is golden and crisp, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, warm white chocolate in the microwave on Defrost until slightly softened but not melted, 20 to 40 seconds. Grate on a vegetable grater. (If the chocolate breaks into fine shreds, rather than large ones, continue to microwave, checking every 10 seconds.)Sprinkle the grated chocolate over the hot pie; let stand until melted.

Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Roast on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a breast registers 165F, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool. Remove and discard the skin and then shred the meat. Reduce the oven temperature to 375F.    Stack the wonton wrappers on a cutting board and cut them into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Separate the strips, lay them on the baking sheet, and mist them lightly with the cooking spray. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Scrunch each strip to give it a wavy shape, if you like. Bake at 375F until golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Reduce the oven heat to 350F.                  Spread the sliced almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.    Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Have a bowl of ice water ready. Boil the snow peas just until bright green but still crisp, about 20 seconds. Drain and transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain.    Put the sesame seeds in a dry skillet and shake or stir over medium heat until light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the hot pan to prevent overcooking.    Make the dressing and assemble the salad:    In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, tamari, sweet chile sauce, garlic, ginger, salt, hot chile sauce, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the peanut and sesame oils.    In a large bowl, toss the cabbage, romaine, and snow peas. In another bowl, toss the chicken and scallions with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Add the chicken to the greens, and then add the sesame seeds and almonds. Toss with enough of the remaining dressing to coat well. Garnish each serving with the baked wonton strips.

http://go.foodgawker.com/1476964/http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/homemade-croissants-step-step-photos/] recipe through step 7. Roll the dough out to about 1/3-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch cutter, cut as many rounds as you can, then roll out remaining dough and cut as much as you can, I got 8 cronuts. Place the cronuts on a floured baking sheet. Cover with large towel and place in a warm place in your kitchen. Allow doughnuts to sit for one hour.Or if using canned crescent dough, open the cans of dough and divide into sets of two triangles. Press the 2 triangles together to seal and form a rectangle, repeat with remaining triangles. Stack 2 rectangles on top of one another, press them together, and then fold widthwise. Press down. Repeat with remaining dough. Using a 3-inch cutter, cut as many rounds as you can, then roll out remaining dough and cut as much as you can, I got 8 cronuts. Place the cronuts on a floured baking sheet. Cover with large towel and place in a warm place in your kitchen. Allow doughnuts to sit for one hour.While the doughnuts rest make the caramel. Add the apple cider to a medium sauce pot and bring to a boil, boil for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the cider has reduced to about 1/3 cup and is thick and syrupy. Reduce the heat and add the brown sugar, butter, cream and cinnamon. Bring back to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes or until the the caramel is thicken and dark in color. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Set aside to cool and thicken more.Make the frosting, in the bowl of a stand mixer beat together the butter and cream cheese until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add powdered sugar and caramel sauce and beat until smooth and combined. Beat in the milk. Set aside in a cool area.Make the apple pecan pie topping, heat a medium size skillet over medium heat, add the butter. Add the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, cook, stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes. Add the pecans and cook another 5 minutes or until the pecans are toasted and the apples are caramelized. During the last minute add the vanilla and cook another minute. Remove from heat and set aside, but keep just slightly warm.Heat a pot of oil to 375 degrees. Fry the cronuts in the oil for about 30 seconds on each side, until golden brown. Place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and allow to cool before frosting.Once cool, spread on to each cronut a good dollop of the frosting and then top with the apple and pecan pie topping. Drizzle with the apple cider caramel sauce. Eat! Like IMMEDIATELY!These are best the very same day they are made, but we still enjoyed ours for a couple of days afterwards.

Cook for a few minutes until it soft, but not browned. Remove it and set aside.2) Add 2 Tablespoons oil and butter to the same pan and the chopped onion. Cook until soft, but not browned, just a few minutes.3) Add risotto rice to pan and cook for 30-60 seconds to heat the rice.4) Deglaze the pan with white wine (or water) an stir.5) Start adding hot chicken stock to the rice 1/2 Cup at a time and stir continuously until rice is translucent and soft, but has a slight bite. Keep adding chicken stock as the rice dries out. After 30-40 minutes the rice should be cooked through.6) Stir corn back into risotto along with Parmesan cheese and taste for salt and pepper.7) Cool risotto completely. It'll probably take 4 hours in the fridge.

Clean the glass jar in hot, soapy water, or use the hottest setting on your dishwasher.2. Combine the cucumbers with the salt, fish sauce, maple syrup, jalape\u00f1o. garlic, and ginger in a medium bowl. Mix well, then transfer everything to the glass jar. If a few pieces of the cucumbers don't fit, that's fine; you can just eat them. 3. Add enough water (preferably filtered water) so the liquid covers the cucumbers. (The cucumbers may want to pop up over the brine, so to ensure they stay below it, I've started putting a piece of sliced cucumber over the top of the pickles as a \"weight\"...you can see what I mean in the top photo of this post). I discard the \"cucumber weight\" once I transfer the pickles to the refrigerator.) It's important to leave about 1 inch/2.5 cm. of room at the top of the jar before closing the lid. If you don't leave enough room, liquid may seep out of your jar as the pickles ferment. 4. Allow your pickles to sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 days. You'll know they're done when the brine begins to bubble; do not worry if the brine is a bit cloudy- this is completely normal (it's also normal for the hue of the cucumbers to darken a bit). Enjoy right away, or store in the refrigerator, where the pickles with keep for at least 2-3 weeks: the heat from the jalape\u00f1os will mellow a bit as they sit in the brine.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/for-spicy-lacto-fermented-pickles-551920", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Endless Meal", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Caramelized-Shallot-and-Gruyere-Fondue-474421.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 474421, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Caramelized Shallot and Gruyere Fondue", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "The Endless Meal", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons calvados or another apple brandy", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "apple brandy", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brandy.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10114037, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "Freshly ground black pepper, use generously", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd cups (or more) dry white wine*", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 14106, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 small clove finely grated or minced garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced", "finely grated", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons all purpose flour.
