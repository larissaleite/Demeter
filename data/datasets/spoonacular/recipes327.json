Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour (it won't rise a lot, just a little bit).For the Filling:Put a Silpat on your counter and put a sheet of parchment paper on top. Sprinkle the paper with a tablespoon of oat flour and turn out the dough.Sprinkle another tablespoon of oat flour over the dough and top with another sheet of parchment paper. Roll the dough to 1/4\" thickness.In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the shortening and almond milk. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until the shortening is melted. Stir in the date sugar and cinnamon (mixture should be spreadable and not too thick).Spread the mixture over the rolled out dough until very close to the edges. Roll the dough and slice into 8.Spray an 8\" cake pan with cooking spray (I used a 6\" cake pan and two silicone cupcake molds) and add the sliced rolls. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until the rolls are slightly firm when tapped. Let cool slightly in the pan, then transfer onto a wire cooling rack.For the Frosting:In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients and scoop over the cinnamon rolls.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/healthy-cinnamon-rolls-2-ways-523255", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Brown Eyed Baker", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Peanut-Butter-Fudge-Cheesecake-507701.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 60, "id": 507701, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peanut Butter-Fudge Cheesecake", "preparationMinutes": 75, "pricePerServing": 84.6, "creditText": "Brown Eyed Baker", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "bittersweet chocolate", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19903, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "24 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 cup creamy peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "creamy peanut butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10116098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "20 miniature peanut butter cup candies, unwrapped and roughly chopped", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "peanut butter candies", "metaInformation": ["miniature", "roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/reeses-pieces-or-peanut-butter-candies.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 20.0, "id": 19151, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Pinch of salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "5\u00bd Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 5.5, "id": 1145, "unit": "Tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "32 Oreo cookies, finely crushed or ground in a food processor", "aisle": "?", "name": "ground in a food processor", "metaInformation": ["crushed", "finely"], "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 32.0, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 29.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2010/03/25/chocolate-peanut-butter-cup-cheesecake/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/cake-pan.png", "id": 404650, "name": "springform pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/measuring-cup.jpg", "id": 404766, "name": "measuring cup"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (300 degrees F if you are using a dark or non-stick pan).

Prepare canner, jars and lids. Wash the jars, lids and screw bands in hot, soapy water. Rinse well and drain (you don't need to dry them). Place a rack in the bottom of a boiling-water canner, then place the required number of jars on the rack. Add water to the jars and the canner until it reaches the top of the jars. Cover the canner and bring the water to a simmer (180 degrees F) over medium heat. Do not boil the jars. Keep jars hot until you're ready to use them. Place the lids in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a simmer (180 degrees F) over medium heat. Again, do not boil the lids. Keep lids hot until you're ready to use them. Set the screw bands aside, they do not require heating.2. In a large, deep stainless steel saucepan, combine crushed blueberries, lemon juice and sugar. Over high heat, stirring constantly, bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Stir in the pectin. Boil hard, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and skim off any foam.3. Working with one jar at a time, remove a jar from the canner, pouring hot water back into the canner. Place the jar on a heat-protected work surface, such as a wooden cutting board or towel. Ladle the hot jam into hot jars, leaving \u00bc-inch headspace. Slide a nonmetallic utensil, such as a rubber spatula, down between the food and the inside of the jar two or three times to release air bubbles. Adjust headspace, if necessary, by adding more hot jam. With a clean damp cloth or paper towel, wipe jar rim and threads. Using a magnetic or nonmetallic utensil, lift a hot lid from the water and place it on the jar, centering the sealing compound on the rim of the jar. Place a screw band  on the jar. With your fingers, screw band down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip-tight. (Do not use excessive force to tighten.) Return the jar to the rack in the hot water-filled canner. Repeat filling steps until all jars are filled.4. When all of the jars are in the canner, adjust the water level in the canner so that it covers the jars by at least 1 inch. Cover the canner with a lid and bring the water to a full rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling hard and continuously, process (continue boiling) for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the lid and let sit for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, remove the jars, lifting them out of the hot water without tilting them. don't dry the lids or jars at this point. You don't want to disturb the lids while the seal is being formed. Place the jars upright on a towel in a draft-free place and let cool, undisturbed, for 24 hours.5. When the processed jars have cooled for 24 hours, check the lids for seal. Remove the screw bands and with your fingers, press down on the center of each lid. Sealed lids will be concave (they'll curve downward) and will show no movement when pressed. Jars that have not sealed properly must be refrigerated immediately. Use unsealed refrigerated product within a few days. For the jars that have good seals, with a damp cloth, thoroughly wipe lids and jar surfaces to remove any water residue or food particles.

Warm the golden syrup in a saucepan until it is runny, or microwave it for 1 minute.  Combine the golden syrup, breadcrumbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl and mix well.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator.  On a floured surface, roll out the larger disk into an 11-inch circle.  Fold it into quarters, brush off excess flour with a pastry brush after each fold, then unfold it into a 9-inch tart pan, easing the sides gently into the pan and pressing the dough down into the fluted edges.  Trim the dough even with the rim.  Roll out the second disk 1/8-inch thick.  Cut the dough into long strips for the lattice topping.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Scrape the filling into the prepared crust and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.  Lay half the strips of dough over the filling in one direction and the other half in the opposite direction to form a lattice.  Trim the overhang.  Gently brush the beaten egg over the lattice.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375\u00b0F and bake for another 25 minutes until the crust is browned and the filling puffs up in the center.
