Yield: 2 cups                                                Warm Salad:                                        For the lentils: In a large saucepan, combine the lentils, bay leaves, garlic, celery, thyme, carrot, fennel, red onion and a good amount of salt. Add water to the pan until it covers the ingredients by about 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the lentils are soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Ladle off 1 cup of the lentil-cooking water and reserve. Remove all the vegetables and aromatics from the lentils and discard. Drain the lentils.For the warm salad: Heat a large saute pan with enough olive oil to coat the pan. Add the diced carrots, fennel and onions and sweat the vegetables about 5 minutes. Add in the garlic and saute 1 minute more. Add in the lentils, red wine vinegar and mustard. Pour in a couple tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid and cook down for a couple minutes. Season with salt and garnish with chopped parsley and fennel fronds.

Add the buttermilk and flour and whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled crust and return to the hot baking sheet in the oven. Bake until the filling is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour (the top may crack slightly). Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pumpkin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Pie                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li ><a href=\"/content/food/topics/p/pumpkin-cheesecake-recipes.html\">Pumpkin</a></li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/b/buttermilk.html\">Buttermilk</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/c/cherry-pie-recipes.html\">Pie</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/buttermilk-pumpkin-pie-750158", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 175, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Peanut Butter and Peepers", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Creamy-Butternut-Squash-Soup-(Vegan)---Winner-of-GO-Veggie-511040.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 511040, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Creamy Butternut Squash Soup (Vegan) / Winner of GO Veggie", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 97.76, "creditText": "Peanut Butter and Peepers", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tbsp. butter (I used Earth Balance)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["(I used Earth Balance)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 lbs.
