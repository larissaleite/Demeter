Cook, stirring occasionally while breaking up beef, until browned. Drain beef and pour onto a plate lined with paper towels, set aside.Heat remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil in pot then add onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper and saute 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer. Pour in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth and add parsley, basil, oregano and cooked beef, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring just to a light boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. While soup simmers, prepare rice according to directions listed on package, then once soup is done simmering stir in desired amount of cooked rice into soup*. Serve warm topped with optional mozzarella cheese (I tried it with and without it and liked both ways) and garnish with fresh parsley.*For a thinner soup don't add all of the rice and for a thicker heartier soup add it all. Also, if you plan on having it for leftovers the next day then don't add the rice to the pot of soup, just add it to each individual bowl, then reserve the rice in a separate container in refrigerator to add to the soup the next day (otherwise it would turn into mush).

"weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 239, "instructions": "To prepare ganache: Line an 8-inch-square pan with foil, letting it overhang two opposing sides slightly. Lightly coat with cooking spray.Combine cream, orange zest, orange juice, sugar and orange liqueur (or vanilla) in a 2-cup glass measure or microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until steaming, about 1 minute; watch to avoid boiling over. (Alternatively, combine in a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just steaming.) Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside for 10 minutes.Place 8 ounces chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. (Alternatively, see No Microwave? below.) Microwave on High for 1 minute. Microwave on Medium, stirring every 20 seconds, until mostly melted. Set aside.Return the cream mixture to the microwave (or stove) and microwave on High (or heat on medium-low) until steaming again. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over the chocolate, pressing down to force through as much liquid as possible; don't stir the chocolate. Let stand without stirring for 2 minutes. Using a clean, dry spoon, slowly stir the cream mixture into the chocolate until smoothly incorporated; at first the ganache will look separated but it will gradually come together after several minutes of stirring. (If any unmelted chocolate remains, return the bowl to the microwave and microwave on Medium for 30 seconds. Stir until completely smooth.) Pour into the prepared pan. Rap it several times to even the surface. Set aside until cooled completely, 3 to 4 hours. Cover and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. (If the ganache is not very firm when pressed, place it in the freezer for up to 1 hour. If rock-hard, remove from the refrigerator and let warm up for several minutes.)To shape truffles: Line a large baking sheet with foil. Transfer the ganache to a cutting board. Peel off the foil. Using a large sharp knife, cut the slab into quarters. Wrap each quarter separately in foil and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Working with one quarter at a time, cut into 12 equal pieces (thirds lengthwise and fourths crosswise). Shape each piece into a rough round, then roll it into a ball between your palms; they don't have to be perfect. Avoid overhandling the balls and wipe off chocolate buildup on your hands with paper towels. Place the balls on the prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining quarters. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour.To coat truffles: Put cocoa in a small deep bowl. Place 8 ounces chocolate in another small microwave-safe bowl and microwave on High for 1 minute; stir well. Continue microwaving on Medium, stirring every 20 seconds, until mostly melted. Stir until the remaining chocolate melts completely.Line another large baking sheet with foil. Remove a dozen balls from the freezer. Working with one ball at a time, quickly submerge it into the chocolate, turning with a fork to coat it completely. Lift the ball out with the fork, tapping it several times against the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. (You only want a thin layer of chocolate covering the ball.) Immediately toss the truffle into the cocoa, swirling the bowl until the truffle is evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining balls of chocolate until they are all coated, stirring the chocolate occasionally.

Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper; butter the parchment.In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar, honey and salt and cook until the sugar has melted and turned golden brown, swirling the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully transfer the mixture to the prepared cake pan.Cut the top and bottom off of each orange. Then cut the skin and pith off of each orange by slicing from top to bottom, following the curve of the fruit. Slice the oranges into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Layer the rounds on top of the caramel in the cake pan. Set aside.For the cake batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt.  In another medium bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks and vanilla. Add the almond flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat to combine. The batter will be stiff.In a clean bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until they form medium-stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Stir in about a third of the egg whites into the almond mixture to loosen it, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Transfer the batter to the pan with the oranges and smooth the top. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 40 to 45 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Carefully flip the cake onto a serving plate. Serve warm or room temperature.

Add the garlic, cook for another min, then tip in the rice. Stir the rice until coated in the oil, and keep stirring until the grains are really hot and starting to hiss. Pour in the wine and stir. Once it\u2019s almost all been absorbed, start adding the stock,a ladle at a time, allowing each ladleful to absorb before adding the next. Stir in a good knob of butter and 25g of the vegetarian parmesan and season to taste. Tip onto a large baking tray and spread out so that it cools quickly (see Know-how, below). Once cool, keep covered in the fridge. Can be cooked and cooled up to 2 days ahead.Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Tip the squash into a roasting pan. Toss with 1 tbsp oil and roast for about 30 mins until softened and golden, turning it occasionally. Meanwhile, melt another knob of butter in a frying pan, add 1 tbsp oil, then fry the sliced shallots until softened and dark golden, about 15 mins. Stir in the chestnuts, pine nuts and herbs, season, then cook for another 2 mins until heated through. Mix with the roasted squash. Can be made up to 2 days ahead.Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Remove any tough outer leaves from the cabbage, then separate the large green leaves from the heads. You\u2019ll need about 10. Blanch for 2 mins or until just tender, then plunge into cold water and drain. Line a 23cm springform cake tin with cling film (or, if reheating in the oven, just butter the tin liberally), then line with most of the cabbage leaves, overlapping slightly and leaving an overhanging edge. Mix the remaining vegetarian parmesan and the mascarpone together, seasoning well with salt and pepper. Spoon half the risotto into the tin (if you\u2019ve chilled the risotto overnight,it\u2019ll need breaking up a little with a fork), then top with the squash mix. Spoon the mascarpone mix over the top, then finish with a second layer of risotto, pressing in firmly.Fold the overhanging edges of the cabbage over the risotto and then \u2018seal\u2019 it in with the remaining leaves. Cover with the overhanging cling film; weight down with a dinner plate. Can be made up to 2 days ahead (if risotto is cooked, cooled and layered on the day).To reheat, turn the cake (still in its cling film) out of the tin onto a microwave-proof plate and cook on Medium for 10 mins or until piping hot throughout. (Microwaving will give you the best results as it keeps the cabbage green and vibrant.) To reheat in the oven, leave the cake in its tin, cover with buttered foil and heat for 30 mins at 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 until hot through.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creamy-risotto-layer-cake-215147", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 175, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Pretty Life in the Suburbs", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Saskatoon-Berry-Butter-Tarts---Berry-How-To-523724.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 523724, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Saskatoon Berry Butter Tarts & Berry How To", "creditText": "A Pretty Life in the Suburbs", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 cups Saskatoon berries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "berries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/berries-mixed.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1009054, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp corn starch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "corn starch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "4 tbsp cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cups flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp fresh lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 cup raisins, seedless", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "raisins", "metaInformation": ["seedless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raisins.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9299, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup white sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white sugar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 27.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.aprettylifeinthesuburbs.com/saskatoon-berry-butter-tarts-berry-how-to/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 194, "instructions": "In a saucepan, mix together the berries and water and simmer for 10 minutes over low-medium heat.In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and flour.Then add the sugar/flour mix to the berries and combine.Simmer until the mixture slightly thickens.Set aside to cool.First beat together the eggs.In a saucepan, melt the butter.Then add the sugar, vanilla, cream, raisins and beaten eggs to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, and boil for 3 minutes.Set aside.Sift flour, salt and sugar into a bowl.With a pie cutter, cut in shortening until the particles are pea sized.Sprinkle in water, 1 tsp or so at a time, mixing lightly with a fork.

Brush the squash with the heat-safe oil mixture and place on the grill, oil-side down. Brush the other sides. Grill for about 8-10 minutes, flipping once, until squash is tender and has nice grill marks. Don't grill them until they're mushy.Dice up the grilled squash and place in a medium bowl with the tomatoes, cucumber, lemon juice, and extra-virgin olive oil mixture. Mix well, then add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle the cheese shavings on top and serve.Nat's Note:1. Why are there two kinds of oil?

Pulse several times to mix. Add the liquid and pulse again until the dough forms a ball. Let the processor run continuously for about 10 seconds to knead the dough.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Invert the dough to an oiled bowl and carefully remove the blade.

Roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hand to a 15\" length and cut each into 1\" pieces to make 30 equal pieces in all                                                                                                                            14                                                                            One at a time, roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hands to make an 8\" strand. Join the ends together to make a circle, pressing firmly to seal. Line up the formed taralli on a lightly floured work surface or floured baking sheets, making sure they do not touch each other.                                                                                                                            15                                                                            Set the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F.                                                                                                                            16                                                                            Fill a large pot (such as the one in which you would cook pasta) 3/4 full with water. Bring the water to a full rolling boil. Set one of the cooling racks on the stovetop (put a pan under it to catch drips) next to the pan of boiling water. Drop the taralli, 6 or 8 at a time into the boiling water and remove them with a skimmer as soon as they float to the surface. Arrange them about an inch apart in all directions, on the prepared racks.                                                                                                                            17                                                                            Bake the taralli about 30 minutes, rotating from the upper third of the oven to the lower third, and vice versa, midway through the baking. Continue baking the taralli until they are golden and crisp.

"instructions": "In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas - this specific dough will yield one pizza large enough to feed about 3-4 people) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees. (If I use my pizza stone, I heat my oven to 475 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. If you're just using a baking sheet, follow the directions below for baking and set to 425 degrees.)pizzaSlice the zucchini into 1/4-inch rounds. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add olive oil. Add the zucchini and garlic to the skillet and toss well to coat. Season with the salt and pepper and stirring occasionally, cook for 5 to 6 minutes until the vegetables soften. Brush the pizza dough with the olive oil. Take the corn kernels and sliced zucchini and place it all over the dough, layering it up however you want. Place the sliced mozzarella on top. Add a few basil leaves if you want, but I like to save them for when the pizza comes out. Bake the pizza for 20 to 25 minutes - or however long it takes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Remove from the oven and cover with a sprinkling of basil leaves. Drizzle with a generous glug of balsamic glaze.

Mashed Potatoes:Rinse and peel potatoes. Cut into uniformed sized pieces (about 1\" cubes) and add them to the bottom of a large pot. Cover potatoes with cold water and salt the water with 2-3 teaspoons of salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until fork tender (a fork should pierce them easily). Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain potatoes and them place into a large bowl. Add butter and beat with a hand mixer until potatoes are nice and crumbled. Add milk and sour cream and continue to mix until smooth, adding salt and pepper to taste. Make sure you salt them well - there is nothing worse than bland potatoes! Set aside until ready to use.For the Shepherd's Pie:Preheat oven at 400 degrees F. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots, celery and garlic and saute until softened (about 5 to 8 minutes). Season with salt and pepper. Once the vegetables begin to brown a little bit, add the tomato paste and mix until well incorporated. Add the ground beef and cook until beef is cooked completeley (it will no longer be pink), about 8-10 minutes. Add the frozen peas and carrots, beef stock, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Reduce heat to low and simmer meat mixture for another 10-12 minutes. Transfer mixture to an oven-safe baking dish and spread into one even layer. Spread potatos in and even layer on top of ground beef mixture. You have 2 options here:1. Top with shredded cheese and bake until melted (about 5 minutes). - This was our obvious choice ;)2. Skip the cheese and rake through the potatoes with a fork to form peaks (helps them brown well), place into the preheated oven and bake until potatoes are browned (about 20 minutes).

Add almonds to a food processor and process until finely ground to tiny bits, set aside.In the bowl of an electric stand mixer set with the paddle attachment cream together butter and 1/2 cup powdered sugar until combined and smooth. Mix in almond extract. Slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined. Mix in ground almonds, folding with a spatula as needed to gather them from the bottom of the mixing bowl (see notes).Scoop dough out 1/2 (half) tablespoon at a time. Shape the 1/2 Tbsp dough into a ball then make a fairly deep indention (large enough to fit the jam) with your finger or thumb. Add 1/2 tsp of the jam. Then scoop out another 1/2 tablespoon of cookie dough and shape into a ball. Make an indentation in that piece then gently place that indented dough ball over the jam filled dough ball, this will make one round ball (so you are basically bringing a jam filled thumbprint dough ball and an unfilled thumbprint dough ball together to create one cookie dough ball. See photo above for the steps). Gently bring some of the dough down on the sides to seal the dough ball shut (which will keep jam from seeping out). Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining dough. Leave space between dough balls on plates so they chill evenly.Transfer dough balls to refrigerator and chill 1 hour 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees during last 15 minutes of chilling. Transfer cookies to a baking sheet spacing them 2-inches apart (leave remaining dough balls that don't fit on baking sheet chilled). Bake in preheated oven until set, about 11 - 13 minutes (careful not to overbake or they can crack and jam may seep out). Remove from oven and allow to cool several minutes, then while they are still warm pour remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl and carefully roll cookies in powdered sugar to give them a light coating. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely then roll once more in powdered sugar to give them a thicker coating.Recipe source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned and the fish is just opaque throughout (the timing will vary depending on the thickness of the fish).5.
