Rinse and scrub the potatoes and then pat them dry. Place the salt in a large bowl and place a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil on your work surface.2. Combine the fennel, coriander, star anise, and cardamom seeds in a large skillet or pan and set it over medium heat. Let it warm, occasionally tilting the pan to toss or swirl or scuttle the spices around so they toast evenly, until the spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Tip the spices onto the parchment paper or foil and let cool.3. Grab the edges of the paper or foil and tilt half the cooled spices into a spice grinder. Coarsely grind them and pour them into the bowl of salt. Repeat with the remaining spices.4. Finely grate the zest from the orange, grapefruit, and lemon, preferably using a microplane. You should have about 1 generous tablespoon total of zest. Use your fingertips to mix it into the salt mixture.5. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).6. Beat the egg whites until they\u2019re just beginning to hold their shape, then fold them into the salt mixture.7. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Pour enough of the salt mixture into the dish to create a 1-inch-thick bed. Arrange the potatoes on the salt in a single layer. Cover with the remaining salt mixture. The potatoes should be completely encased with salt and spice.8. Roast until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes for 1-inch potatoes or 35 minutes for 2-inch potatoes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.9. For potatoes served whole, dump them in a bowl, toss with fresh rosemary leaves, if desired, and drizzle with olive oil.For thin, chip-like potatoes, place the potatoes between pieces of parchment paper lightly brushed with oil and press a meat pounder or a heavy skillet against them to flatten.

Line the baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.  Remove dough from refrigerator in small amounts. Scoop about \u00bd tablespoon of at a time onto a piece of waxed paper. Use the waxed paper to roll the dough into a log of 6 inch length and \u00be inch wide, and then shape it into thin finger-shaped cookie. Press one almond into one end of each cookie to give the appearance of a long fingernail. Squeeze cookie near the tip and again near the center of each to give the impression of knuckles. You can also cut into the dough with a fork at the same points to help give a more finger-like appearance. Arrange the shaped cookies on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are slightly golden in color, 25 minutes.  Remove the almond from the end of each cookie; squeeze a small amount of red decorating gel into the cavity; replace the almond to cause the gel to ooze out around the tip of the cookie.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/edible-spider-sandwich-and-witch-finger-cookies-spooky-treats-for-halloween-488304", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eating Well", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/loaded-twice-baked-potatoes-696236.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 696236, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Loaded Twice-Baked Potatoes", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Eating Well", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup broccoli florets, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "broccoli florets", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broccoli.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011090, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces 90%-lean ground beef, (see Variation)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "lean ground beef", "metaInformation": ["(see Variation)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/meat-ground-red.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 23557, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "low fat shredded cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "divided", "reduced-fat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001168, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "low fat sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour", "reduced-fat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1179, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 medium russet potatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "russet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11353, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 scallions, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11291, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 92.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/loaded_twice_baked_potatoes.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 14748, "instructions": "No microwave?

Heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with (unbleached) parchment paper or a silicone baking liner. 2. In an electric mixer on low speed, beat the sugar with the butter until smooth (about 1 minute). Add the flours. Beat on medium-low speed until the dough comes together. If it doesn't come together in the mixer after a minute or two, turn the mixer off and use your hands to form a cohesive dough.3. Pinch off small pieces of dough (about the size of a teaspoon) and use your hands to roll them into small balls (you should have 10 balls of approximately the same size when you are done rolling them). Arrange cookies on the prepared cookie sheet 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart. Using your thumb, press down into the middle of each ball to make a well. (You want the indentation to be deep enough to hold the filling, but you don't want to press all the way through the dough.) If the edges of the cookies crack as you press the centers down, gently pinch/press them back together.4. Bake until the tops of the cookies look dry, and they're beginning to brown, 16-18 minutes. Let the cookies sit for 5 minutes and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely (while they are cooling and still a bit soft, you can press the indentations down a bit more, if necessary). Serve immediately, or cover and store at room temperature for up to 2 days. Just before serving, fill each cookie's indentation with the filling(s) of your choice.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/for-grain-free-thumbprint-cookies-551955", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 25, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Renee's Kitchen Adventures", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mini-Snickers-Cheesecake-Bites-626369.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 626369, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Mini Snickers Cheesecake Bites", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Renee's Kitchen Adventures", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp. caramel extract", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "caramel", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soft-caramels.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19074, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "Chocolate and caramel syrup for drizzling", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "caramel syrup", "metaInformation": ["for drizzling"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sauce-caramel.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 48.0, "id": 19364, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large", "at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup graham cracker crumbs", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "graham cracker crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10018617, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 (8 oz.) bars of full fat cream cheese, at room temperature", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "low-fat cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 43274, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "48 Mini muffin tin paper liners (1 5/8\" size)", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "rice paper", "metaInformation": ["mini", "(1 5/8\" size)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/puff-pastry.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 48.0, "id": 10118368, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "pinch of salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 - 2 (8 oz.) packages of SNICKERS\u00ae Unwrapped Bites, cut into half", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "snickers", "metaInformation": ["cut into half"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/snickers.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 19155, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 17.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.reneeskitchenadventures.com/2015/01/mini-snickers-cheesecake-bites.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 67, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Prepare your baking dishes (ramekins, 8x8 brownie pan, small spring form pan may all be used) by buttering and lightly dusting with cocoa powder.Trim the stems off the figs and slice in half. In the bowl of a food processor, place the figs and process until they are pur\u00e9ed. Set aside.In a bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until smooth and light in color. Gradually add the cocoa powder and mix well. Blend in the egg, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Add the cake flour and salt on low speed, mixing until just incorporated. Stir in the fig pur\u00e9e. Pour into baking dish(es) and place a baking pan filled partially with water in the oven to bake. Baking time will depend on your baking dishes. In general, the cakes will bake for about 30 minutes, give or take. Just be sure to test with toothpick - when inserted, it should be clean when removed. For larger baking dishes, it will take closer to 40 minutes total baking time.Make the Toffee Sauce by placing the butter, brown sugar and heavy cream in a small heavy saucepan over low-medium heat. When the sugar has dissolved and the sauce has darkened and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it is ready.When the cakes are baked, remove from the oven. Poke many holes into the cakes with a toothpick, and spoon about half the sauce over them, letting the cakes absorb the gooeyness. At this point, the cakes may sit for up to 2 hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. To reheat the pudding cakes, place in a 300\u00b0 oven for about 10 minutes, or until heated through. Otherwise, let it sit for at least 20 minutes to allow the sauce to absorb into the cake, then serve whilst warm, along with vanilla ice cream and remaining toffee sauce.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Pour mixture over the dry ingredients and stir with a spatula just until the dough comes together. The dough will be sticky. Still in the bowl, gently knead the dough by hand, just until the dough comes together. 4. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and turn out the dough.  Pat the dough into a circle. Gently roll out the dough. You want the dough to be about an inch thick. Cut the dough into shortcakes using a cookie cutter, biscuit cutter or glass bottom. Place the shortcakes on the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. 5. Brush the shortcakes with cream and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown.

Use your hands to form a well in the center of the flour.In a small, separate bowl, whisk together eggs and olive oil. Add this mixture to the well you made in the flour.Use your hands to mix ingredients together until well incorporated. The mixture should hold together but not be sticky. If the mixture is too dry, add water 1 Tbsp. at a time and mix to combine. When dough holds together and doesn\u2019t stick to your hands, it\u2019s ready. Let it rest for 15 minutes before you roll it out. You can also refrigerate it overnight and roll it out the next day.Break pieces of dough off in 1/2 cup increments and run them through a pasta roller (I use this one. If you don\u2019t have a pasta roller, you can also roll the dough by hand until it is about 1-2 mm thick). If you\u2019re using a pasta roller, start by rolling the dough through on the #1 (lowest) setting. Roll the dough through the next 3-4 settings until it is very thin (I usually stop rolling at a #4 or 5 setting).To form the raviolis, lay one sheet of pasta down on a flat surface. You can either use a ravioli press (that\u2019s what I prefer, it makes them all very uniform in size), a ravioli cutter, or fill and fold them by hand. To fill and fold by hand, cut the dough into squares, place filling in the center of the square, and fold the edges over to make a triangle. With a ravioli cutter, place a little less than 1 tsp. of filling on the flat sheet of dough, repeating every 2 inches or so. Lay another sheet over the filling-covered sheet, and press down in between the fillings to hold dough together. Cut around each filling with a ravioli cutter (you can also use a cookie or biscuit cutter). If using a ravioli press, follow package directions to form ravioli.Cook ravioli in boiling water for 7-8 minutes. Top with mushroom cream sauce and parsley. Serve immediately.In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion, thyme, salt, and pepper. Saute 2 minutes.Add sliced mushrooms. Saute an additional 3 minutes or until onion is translucent and mushrooms have cooked through. Remove mixture from heat and let cool.Mix ricotta cheese into cooled mushroom mixture. Fill each ravioli with about 2/3 of a tsp. of the mixture. (see ravioli filling directions in step 5 above).Cover ravioli to chill overnight or freeze for later, or cook immediately. Cook in boiling water for 7-8 minutes or until pasta is cooked through. Top with mushroom cream sauce and parsley.

"aggregateLikes": 1994, "instructions": "For the Chicken:Set up an assembly line of three rimmed dishes. In the first dish, add the flour, salt, and pepper; mix well.  In the second dish, add the 2 beaten eggs. In the last dish, combine the panko and parmesan cheese. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Line a large jelly roll pan/baking sheet with foil, and top with an oven-safe cookie cooling rack. Spray well with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is nice and hot, pan sear the chicken (only 2 at a time to avoid over-crowding) for 2-3 minutes per side. Keep a close eye as they will brown quickly due to the parmesan cheese. They should be nice and golden when you flip them. Once both sides are browned, remove and place onto prepared pan. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and olive oil and repeat process with the last 2 chicken breasts.Place pan into oven and bake for 12-18 minutes at 350\u00ba F until chicken is cooked through (cooking time depends on how thin you pound out the chicken).For the Lemon Butter Sauce:While chicken is baking, add the butter, olive oil, and chicken broth to the pan that the chicken was cooked in.

Check the contents of the pot occasionally\u2014the oil should never come to a full simmer. You may need to reduce the heat. Cook until the meat is tender but not falling apart, about 3 hours. Remove the pot from the oven. (To make the confit in advance, you can cool the rabbit to room temperature and refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days. You must slowly heat the pieces in confit oil in a warm oven before grilling or searing, otherwise the center will be cold.)3.

Process the flour, sugar, and salt together in a food processor until combined. Scatter the shortening over the top and process until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the top and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.2. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture. Stir and press the dough together, using a stiff rubber spatula, until the dough sticks together. If the dough does not come together, stir in the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.3. Divide the dough into 2 even pieces. Turn each piece of dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten each into a 3-inch disk. Wrap each piece tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling out the dough, let it sit on the counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (The wrapped dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let the dough thaw completely on the counter before rolling it out.)4. Roll out one disk of dough into a 9-inch circle on a lightly floured counter, then fit it into a 6-inch pie plate, letting the excess dough hang over the edge; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Roll out the other disk of dough into a 9-inch circle on a lightly floured counter, then transfer to a parchment paper\u2013lined plate; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.5. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Make the filling6. Meanwhile, toss the nectarines, raspberries, and 1/4 cup of the sugar together in a medium bowl, and let sit, tossing occasionally, until the fruit releases its juice, about 20 minutes.7. Drain the fruit thoroughly through a colander, reserving 1 tablespoon of the juice. In a medium bowl, toss the drained fruit, reserved juice, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt together until well combined. (If the fruit tastes tart, add up to 1 1/2 tablespoons more sugar.)8. Spread the fruit in the dough-lined pie plate, mounding it slightly in the middle. Following the photos, gently arrange the second piece of pie dough over the pie. Trim, fold, and crimp the edges, and cut 3 vent holes in the top. Brush the crust with the egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar.9. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and bake until the top crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C), rotate the baking sheet, and continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Let the pie cool on a wire rack until the filling has set, about 1 1/2 hours.

Divide the spinach between 4 buttered ramekins, then break an egg into each. Season with salt and pepper, then top with a slice of butter. Bake for  10-12 mins, until the eggs are just set. Meanwhile, grill the bread on one side until crisp, then spread the untoasted side with the remaining butter and grill again until crisp.

Trim the nubby ends and any discolored leaves off the Brussels sprouts, then cut the sprouts in half lengthwise.Transfer the sprouts to a large, rimmed baking sheet (I covered mine in parchment paper first for easy cleanup), then toss them with about 2 tablespoons olive oil, until they are coated with a light, even layer of oil. Arrange the sprouts in an even layer, flat sides down, and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing halfway, until they are tender and deeply caramelized on the edges.Meanwhile, to prepare the sauce: In your smallest saucepan, add the tamari or soy sauce, honey or maple syrup, rice vinegar, sesame oil,  teaspoon sriracha and garlic. Whisk until combined, then taste and add more sriracha if you'd like (mine was just right with 1 teaspoons sriracha, but I love spicy food).Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. It's done when, if you take it off heat long enough for it to stop bubbling and carefully tilt the pan back and forth, the sauce will slide down the pan rather than slosh.Transfer the roasted sprouts to a medium serving bowl. Pour the sauce over the sprouts and toss to coat. Add the peanuts, green onion and optional cilantro and toss again. Serve immediately, with red pepper flakes sprinkled on top if you'd like a little extra heat (and color).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/kung-pao-brussels-sprouts-699786", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Rachel Cooks", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Easy-Spinach-Artichoke-Phyllo-Bites-493412.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 12, "id": 493412, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Easy Spinach Artichoke Phyllo Bites", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Rachel Cooks", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup of quartered artichoke hearts, drained and rinsed and roughly chopped", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "artichoke hearts", "metaInformation": ["rinsed", "drained", "roughly chopped", "quartered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/artichoke-hearts.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93828, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2031, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "6 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened", "room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 10 ounce package of frozen chopped spinach, drained and liquid squeezed out", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "frozen spinach", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "drained", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spinach-frozen.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 11463, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "mozzarella cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mozzarella-fresh.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1026, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "45-60 Athens Phyllo Shells (3-4 packages)", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "phyllo shells", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mini-phyllo-shells.png", "unitLong": "packages", "unitShort": "packages", "amount": 3.0, "id": 93817, "unit": "packages"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 45.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1056, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 35.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.rachelcooks.com/2013/12/11/easy-spinach-artichoke-phyllo-bites/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "aggregateLikes": 101, "instructions": "In a medium mixing bowl, mix cream cheese, parmesan cheese, sour cream, mozzarella, drained spinach, chopped artichokes and cayenne pepper.

Turn the mixture out onto the parchment-lined baking sheet and lightly knead into a soft dough, being careful not to overwork.* Pat into a 1\" thick round and freeze for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 425F. Use the parchment to lift the dough from the baking sheet, and line baking sheet with a clean piece of parchment. Use a 2 1/2\" round biscuit/cookie cutter to cut the dough into individual rounds. Lightly knead together remaining scraps, pat into a 1\" thick circle again, and cut remaining scones. Use the last bit of scraps to form the final scone. Space scones apart on the prepared baking sheet and brush tops with egg. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of one comes out clean. These, like most scones, are best served warm the day they're made (especially with butter and jam), but any leftovers can be stored in a zip-top bag or airtight container and kept at room temperature for a few days.

Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners and spray with cooking spray. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the buttermilk, food coloring and vanilla in a spouted measuring cup; set aside.Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a stand mixer (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed until very light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer still on medium, slowly add the eggs and beat until fully incorporated. Reduce the speed to the lowest setting; with the mixer running, add 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, then 1/2 of the remaining flour mixture, then the remaining buttermilk mixture, then the remaining flour mixture. Scrape down the sides and beat until well mixed. Fill the prepared liners about 3/4 full of batter. Bake until the cupcakes bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.For the frosting: Put the flour in a small saucepan. Vigorously whisk in about 1/2 cup milk, making sure to get the whisk into the edges of the pan, until you have a smooth, thick paste. (This step keeps the flour from clumping.) Slowly whisk in the remaining milk until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is very thick, about 5 minutes. (Toward the end of the process, the mixture will become a thick paste; it may seem to be forming lumps, but whisk vigorously and the lumps will disappear.) Scrape into a bowl, press plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until cool, about 45 minutes.Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a hand mixer), beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the cooled flour mixture a tablespoon at a time and beat until smooth. Switch to the whisk attachment (or continue with the hand mixer), add the vanilla, salt and 3 to 5 drops green food coloring and whip until very light and fluffy, like thick whipped cream, up to 10 minutes with a stand mixer or 12 minutes with a hand mixer.To assemble: Using a sharp serrated knife, cut 3 cupcakes in half vertically, gently sawing through the paper liners; set aside. Frost the remaining cupcakes. Put the sanding sugar on a small plate and roll the edge of each cupcake 3/4 of the way around in the sugar, making a green border around each with a gap on one side. On a large serving platter, arrange 18 cupcakes in groups of three, pushing them together at the gaps, to make 6 shamrock cakes. Dip the tops of the cupcake halves in sugar and wedge a pointy end of 1 half between 2 of the cupcakes in each group to form the stems.Copyright 2013 Television Food Network, G.P.

(The larger cupcakes will have a slightly smaller dome.)
