"Making the Pizza Dough1 Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam, which indicates that it is still active and alive.2 Make and knead the pizza dough:Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix in the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.If the dough seems a little too wet, sprinkle it witha littlemore flour.3 Put dough in warm place to rise:Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place (75-85F) until it doubles in size, at least1 to 1 1/2 hours.You can let it sit for several hours if you want. The longer rise will improve the flavor of the pizza crust.If you don't have a warm spot in the house you can heat the oven to 150 degrees, and then turn off the oven. Let the oven cool till it is just a little warm, then place the bowl of dough in this warmed oven to rise.At this point, if you want to make ahead, you can freeze the dough in an airtight container for up to two weeks.Preparing the Pizzas1 Preheat pizza stone: Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 450F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.2 Punch down dough, divide into two balls: Remove the plastic cover from the dough and punch the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half. Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 10 minutes.3 Prep toppings:Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.4 Flatten dough ball, and stretch out into a round:Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface.Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick.Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches.Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. You can pinch the very edges if you want to form a lip.5 Brush dough top with olive oil:Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Use your finger tips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Let rest another 5 minutes.Repeat with the second ball of dough.6 Sprinkle pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top: Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with corn meal. (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.

Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven.9 Bake pizza: Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes.

Note - Coconut oil should be the consistency of soft butter like you'd use to cream with sugar and eggs in traditional cookies. If coconut oil is rock hard, microwave it in a small bowl for 5 to 10 seconds or just until it begins to soften. If coconut oil is runny or melted, place it in the freezer momentarily until it firms up. A tiny amount of runniness is fine; it's an oil and that happens. But do not use melted or purely liquid coconut oil because you can't effectively cream a liquid; it would be like trying to cream liquid butter. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the vanilla, molasses, and beat to incorporate, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the flour, corn starch, baking soda, optional salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Using a medium cookie scoop, form mounds that are 2 heaping tablespoons in size; or divide dough into approximately 15 to 16 equal-sized pieces. Place dough mounds on a large plate, and slightly flatten each mound. Very important to get the dough mounds in the exact shape you want to bake them in because after chilling, flattening or re-shaping them is very difficult. Cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours; up to 5 days. Do not bake these cookies with dough that has not been properly chilled because they will spread. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F, line a baking sheet with a\u00a0Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat, parchment, or spray with cooking spray. Place dough on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart; I bake a maximum of 8 per sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tops have just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. They firm up as they cool and I recommend the lower end of the baking range because they taste best when softer. The cookies in the photos were baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated once midway through baking. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before moving. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg; mix well. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking dish.

granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Make a hole in the center of the flour mixture and add the pumpkin, ricotta, milk, vanilla and egg yolks and mix gently to combine.In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites with a pinch of salt. Using a mixer or whisk, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks and look very fluffy, like snowdrifts.Using a rubber spatula, scoop a third of the egg whites into the pumpkin batter and fold to gently combine. Repeat this process two more times until all the whites have been added. Do this gently but quickly  the idea is to not squish the air out of the egg whites. This is the secret to keeping the pancakes fluffy!Place a griddle over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, drop a pat or two of butter onto the griddle. Once melted, schmear the butter around and wipe up any excess with a paper towel.Using a 2-ounce ladle, spoon ladlefuls of batter onto the buttered griddle to create 3-inch pancakes. Let the pancakes cook until bubbles appear on the surface, burst, and then stay open  this will take about 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook the second side until golden brown. Re-butter the griddle and repeat until all the batter is gone or everyone is full. Hold the finished pancakes in the warm oven.For the compote: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the apples, cider, cinnamon stick, star anise and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer (BTB, RTS), then continue cooking until the liquid has reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes.Add the maple syrup and raisins. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and serve spooned over the pancakes, dusted with powdered sugar if desired. Try not to eat too many.                                                    \"Own Your Own Kitchen: Recipes to Inspire & Empower\" by Anne Burrell Clarkson Potter 2013.

Add vanilla and eggs and continue mixing until smooth and combined, scraping sides as needed. Add the flour mixture, alternately with the creme fraiche or sour cream, mixing after each addition until just mixed in. Fold in shredded zucchini and mini chocolate chips.Pour batter into prepared bundt pan and bake for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove cake from oven and let it cool on a baking rack for 20 minutes before removing it from pan. To make the frosting, melt butter, milk, and cocoa powder over medium heat. Stir frequently until chocolate is smooth.

To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop.2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speeds with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining \u00be cup flour to stiffen the dough.3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). The dough should be firm, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour \u2013 all the ingredients should be hydrated. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems tacky or sticky, add more flour to achieve the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feels satiny and pliable but not be tacky.4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 pieces for standard bagels, or 24 pieces if you are making mini bagels. Form the pieces into rolls.5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes.6. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels by pushing a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretching out the hole to 2 \u00bd inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all around.7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the \u201cfloat test\u201d. Fill a small bowl with cool or room-temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. if it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the pot the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby.10. For Homemade Everything Bagel Topping, combine: poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried garlic, dried onion and kosher salt.  This makes enough topping for 12 large bagels or 24 mini bagels.  11. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. If you like very chewy bagels, you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-line sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. As soon as the bagels come out of the water, top them with the Everything Bagel mixture.12. When all the bagels have been boiled, place the pans on the 2 middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 5 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are baking only 1 pan, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven setting to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 5 minutes, or until the bagels turn light golden brown. You may bake them darker if you prefer.13.

In a small saucepan, heat milk until just warm, about 80-90 degrees. Milk should not simmer. Pour into a medium bowl (preferably glass to see rise) and stir in yeast until dissolved. Add the flour and stir together until evenly combined. Dough will be sticky. Cover and allow to rise for 2-3 hours or overnight in the fridge. Dough. Measure out ingredients and set aside. In a stand mixer with the dough hook, add the preferment mixture to the bowl as well as the yeast. Mix together on low speed until evenly combined, about 1 minute, scraping down sides if necessary. Increase speed to medium and beat for another 3 minutes, slowly adding half the milk until incorporated. Reduce speed to low and add remaining milk, 5 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Mix until a loose shaggy dough forms, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 15 minutes. (A good rule of thumb, work the dough as little as possible. Overworking dough will result in a tough, glutenous, dense croissant. This same rule applies to biscuits, scones, and pie dough.) With the mixer speed on low, mix until dough is smooth and elastic. Dough should be neither sticky nor dry. Add remaining cup of flour 1/4 cup at a time until consistency is reached. You may not use all the flour. If your dough is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time. For added visibility, transfer dough to a glass bowl and cover. Allow to rise in a cool place for 1 1/2 hours. Dough should double in size. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Press dough out into a rectangle, 2 inches thick. Wrap in plastic and place in refrigerator for 4 hours. Roll-in butter. About 3 hours into the chill, prepare the butter. Add butter to stand mixer fitted with  paddle attachment and beat butter on medium until malleable, about 3 minutes. Wrap butter in plastic wrap and shape into a square, about 1 inch thick. Return to fridge to chill but not harden. Remove dough and butter from fridge to begin laminating. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Roll out into a 28\" x 12\" rectangle. With the longest side of the rectangle facing you, add the butter square the the left side and evenly spread over 2/3 of the rectangle. Fold dough in thirds, first folding the right, non-buttered portion over. Then fold the left, buttered portion over that as you would fold a letter. This is considered a plaque. Press the seams together to seal the butter into the plaque. Turn the plaque so that the long edge is facing you again. Roll out into a 28\" x 12\" rectangle. Fold dough into thirds once again and wrap in plastic wrap. Return dough to fridge to rest for 2 hours.Finally, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Again, roll out into a 28\" x 12\" rectangle. Fold into thirds. The dough should measure 9\" x 12\", and about 2\" thick. Wrap again, but this time place into the freezer to chill for 1 hour. If making croissants the next morning, retire dough from freezer to fridge overnight. (Dough can be kept in freezer for up to one week. Thaw in fridge overnight before using.) Remove dough from fridge to form, proof, and bake. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Roll out into a 32\" x 12\" rectangle, 3/8\" thick. This takes some muscle. Using a pastry wheel, pizza cutter, or chef's knife, cut long triangles 4\" wide at the base for croissants, or 6\" x 4\" rectangles for Pain au Chocolats.Line a baking sheet with a Silpain or parchment paper. To shape croissants, begin with the base facing you and tightly roll towards the point. The point should sit underneath the croissant. You should have 6-7 ridges. To roll Pain au Chocolats, add a chocolate baton or dark chocolate chips in a row and roll tightly placing the seam underneath. Place on lined baking sheet, at least 2\" apart on all sides. In a warm, draft-free room, allow pastries to rise for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. The cooler the kitchen, the longer the rise. Pastries should be somewhat firm yet puffy. Egg wash. In a small bowl whisk together ingredients until pale yellow. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Using a pastry brush, carefully paint the pastries being sure to cover all sides. Wipe any drippings off the Silpain. Allow the egg wash to dry slightly before baking. Place croissants in oven and immediately turn heat down to 400 degrees. Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate pan and continue to bake for another 6-10 minutes until deep golden. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.Storage. Keep covered at room temperature once cooled for up to a day. Store up to one week in an airtight container in fridge.

Set aside.Cook The Chicken and Vegetables: Mix cumin, salt and chili powder in a small bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the chicken to the pan, spreading it out as much as possible. (If using cooked chicken, see *note below) Sprinkle spice mix evenly over chicken. Cook, tossing frequently for 2 minutes, until almost cooked through. Add corn, zucchini and onion to the pan. Cook for 2 minutes, tossing frequently so everything cooks evenly. Add  cup of salsa verde and simmer for a minute or so, until most of the liquid evaporates. Remove pan from heat. Add feta and 4 tablespoons of cilantro. Toss to combine and set pan aside.Crisp The Tortillas in the Broiler: Work with two tortillas at a time. Spray or brush tortillas lightly with oil on both sides. Lay on a cookie sheet or baking pan. Broil in the center of the oven for two minutes, or until they get some brown spots. (Keep watch to prevent burning). Repeat with two remaining tortillas.Assemble and Broil the Tostadas: Set two of the toasted tortillas on a baking sheet. Scoop  of the chicken mixture onto each tortilla. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of Monterey jack over each. Broil in the middle of the oven for 2 - 2 minutes, until the cheese has melted. (check often to prevent burning) Repeat with remaining two tortillas.To Serve: Carefully transfer tostadas to 4 plates, using a spatula or even two spatulas. Sprinkle on remaining cilantro. Add a generous dollop of avocado salsa to each. Season with salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste. Serve immediately.*Note: If using cooked chicken, add vegetables to the pan first. Sprinkle spices over the veggies. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken and cook for 30 seconds, tossing, to heat.

For the potatoes: Put the potatoes in an 8-quart stockpot with enough cold water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and allow to dry for 5 minutes. Using the palm of your hand, gently press the potatoes until lightly smashed.In a large, nonstick skillet, heat 1/4 cup of oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and lightly brown, about 1 minute. Remove the garlic and discard. In batches, add the potatoes and cook, without stirring, until the bottoms turn golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes. Using a spatula, turn the potatoes over and cook, drizzling with oil, if needed, until golden brown on the other side for another 5 to 8 minutes.For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, parsley, thyme, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Spoon the dressing over the potatoes and toss gently until coated. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl and serve.
