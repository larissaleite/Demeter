"aggregateLikes": 3013, "instructions": "To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease (no flour is needed here) three 8-inch round cake pans with butter or baking spray. Line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper and lightly grease the paper.In a very large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine them well. Add the oil and sour cream and whisk to blend. Gradually beat in the water - splashing may occur if you add it too quickly (trust me). Blend in the vinegar and vanilla. Whisk in the eggs and beat until well blended. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and be sure the batter is well-mixed and no flour bits remain. Divide among the 3 prepared cake pans - using a kitchen scale really helps to ensure the layers will be equal in size.Bake for 30 to 35 minutes on the same rack, if possible, without the cake pans touching each other, or until a cake tester or wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean. Let cool in the pans for about 20 minutes. Invert onto wire racks, carefully peel off the paper liners, and let cool completely.To make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the peanut butter and butter.  Sift the sugar into the bowl.  Add the vanilla extract and salt.  Starting on low and gradually increasing (to prevent the sugar from covering your kitchen) the speed to medium-high, beat the ingredients until light and fluffy, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed, about 3-4 minutes.  Beat in the heavy whipping cream.To frost the cake: Place one layer, flat side up, on a cake stand, cardboard cake round, or large serving plate. Spread 2/3 cup of the peanut butter frosting evenly over the top. Repeat with the next layer. Place the last layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with a scant amount of frosting to make a crumb coat to keep the crumbs from popping through the final frosting.  You'll need just enough to lightly cover the cake - there's no need to be neat here. Let the cake chill for 15 to 30 minutes until firm, then use the remainder of the frosting to create a smooth final coating.  Once the cake is fully frosted, chill the cake again and let it firm up before covering it with the ganache.To make the ganache: In the in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, combine the chocolate, peanut butter, and corn syrup. Cook, whisking often, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the half-and-half, beating until smooth. Use while still warm.To decorate with the ganache: Gently pour the ganache over the top of the cake, and using an offset spatula, spread it evenly over the top just to the edges so that it runs down the sides of the cake in long drips. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes to allow the ganache to set completely. Take the cake out of the fridge about 1 hour before serving - it will be difficult to cut through the ganache if it is too cold.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

                        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Heat the olive oil in a large oven proof saute pan over medium heat, add the onions and garlic and cook for about 5 minutes until translucent.  Add the red pepper flakes and dried oregano and cook for 1 minute more.  Add the vodka and continue cooking until the mixture is reduced by half.Meanwhile, drain the tomatoes through a sieve and crush them into the pan with your hands.  Add 2 teaspoons salt and a pinch of black pepper.  Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid and place it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta al dente.  Drain and set aside.Place the tomato mixture in a blender and puree in batches until the sauce is a smooth consistency.  Return to the pan.Reheat the sauce, add 2 tablespoons fresh oregano and enough heavy cream to make the sauce a creamy consistency.  Add salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Toss the pasta into the sauce and cook for 2 minutes more.  Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan.  Serve with an additional sprinkle of Parmesan and a sprinkle of fresh oregano on each plate.                                                    2009, Joseph Realmuto, All Rights Reserved

Cook chicken until fully cooked through, about 8 - 12 minutes, occasionally rotating chicken (time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts. If chicken is browning too quickly reduce heat to medium low as needed). Transfer cooked chicken to a plate, let rest 5 minutes then dice into pieces.Meanwhile cook pasta according to directions listed on package, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.In a clean skillet (large and deep), melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly, add garlic and cook 30 seconds longer, stirring constantly. While whisking, slowly pour in milk then cream (whisk vigorously to break up clumps). Season with salt and pepper to taste (a fair amount of each) and bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Once it reaches a boil and thickens, reduce heat to medium-low, add Neufchatel and parmesan cheese and cook, stirring frequently, until cheeses have melted.

Add in reserved pasta water as desired (it will thicken as it rests and the pasta will absorb the liquids, so add up to 1/2 cup as needed). Serve immediately.

Par-cook the potatoes for 13 minutes to soften. Immediately turn off the heat. Let the potatoes cool completely in the wine, then strain and pat dry with paper towels. Slice the potatoes into 1/2-by-1/2-by-2 1/2-inch fries.For the cabernet ketchup: Add the cabernet to a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and reduce to 1/4 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the grapeskin flour and the ketchup. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely.In a heavy-duty pot, preheat 3 inches of canola oil to 250 degrees F. Blanch the potatoes in the preheated oil for 2 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Raise the oil temperature to 350 degrees F and fry the potatoes a second time until crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with salt immediately.Serve the red wine fries with the cabernet ketchup.

Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 piece of dough; refrigerate until ready to assemble.Make the cinnamon-roll crust: Lay the remaining piece of dough on a lightly floured surface and spread the butter evenly on top. Combine 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the butter, then gently press with your fingers to help the mixture adhere. Roll the pie dough into a tight log. Trim and discard about 1 1/2 inches from both ends; cut the remaining log crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the pieces cut-side down in a snug circle on floured parchment paper. Lightly dust with more flour, then gently roll out into a 10-inch round. Slide the parchment onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to assemble the pie.Peel and thinly slice the apples. Toss with the lemon juice, vanilla and the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl. Transfer to the dough-lined pie plate; invert the cinnamon-roll crust on top and peel off the parchment (it's OK if the individual rounds separate a bit in the process). Pinch the crusts together; fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp as desired. Brush with the beaten egg.Set the pie on the hot baking sheet in the oven; bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 50 minutes. (Tent loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack to cool slightly.Whisk the confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth. (Add more milk if the glaze is too thick.) Drizzle over the pie.Photograph by Levi Brown                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, add the pearl onions and cook 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, pat dry and set aside.Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, stir in the flour, nutmeg and some salt and pepper and cook until the flour is well incorporated and the raw flavor cooks out, 3 to 4 minutes.Add the cream and chicken stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the pearl onions, then the kale, little by little, and cook until it wilts, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, stir in the Parmesan, taste, and adjust seasonings.

I didn't but it would be lovely inside for sure.Transfer the whipping cream to a pastry bag with a large tip.

Mix milk with egg slowly. Add egg mix to center of well and beat until aerated. Set aside.Start heating oil to 375F. Run fingers across fish fillets and remove any pin bones. Slice the fillets into 1\" by 3\" strips. When oil is up to temperature add beer to batter and mix in. Dip and coat fillets with batter** and place into oil. Fry to a light golden brown, turning once. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. To keep pieces hot, they can be placed in a 300F oven while the balance is frying.*There are other cods, known as brown or red, do not use! The texture of meat and amount of natural oil doesn't give you the light flakiness desired.**The batter will appear very thick and heavy, that's ok. As long as you keep your oil temp up, there will be no sponging.Options: Try adding dry mustard, (Coleman's) or hot Hungarian paprika to flour mix. A bit of ground cayenne works too.ChipsPeel 5 med. Idaho potatoes, slice into 1/2\" square strips by the length of the potato. Rinse in cold water to reduce starch. Leave in water until oil is 375F. Grab a large handful and pat dry with paper towel until fairly dry, reduces spattering. Place into hot oil and fry until golden brown. Do a handful a time, keeping cooked ones warm in the oven.Assemble plate, sprinkle with a little salt and malt vinegar and enjoy.Please, \"NO\" ketchup.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Continue mixing until dough comes together then turn over onto a floured surface (make sure to use grain free flour!)Knead dough for about a minute, until really well incorporated then shape into a flat rectangle. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.The easiest way to roll this dough is between two sheets of parchement paper, but you could also choose to do it on a floured surface. Again, make sure to use non grain flour, such as quinoa. Roll the dough to form a square large enough to cover large individual quiche dishes.Now this dough doesn\u2019t have any gluten to hold it together, so you might not be able to lift it and place it onto your dishes in one piece. Get ready to do a little bit of patchwork!Cut your dough into 4 pieces and place each piece onto an individual quiche dish. If your dough should rip or even break, which will probably happen, don't worry about it. Just stitch and repair the pieces as you go, until your dish is entirely covered, sides and all. Repeat with remaining 3 pieces and set aside. Set your oven to broilLine a baking sheet with parchement paper and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add sweet potato, apple, olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly and transfer onto reserved pan. Place in oven under broiler and cook until potato and apple start to caramelize and turn slightly golden. Remove from oven and set temperature to 375F Transfer potato mixture back to large mixing bowl and add the rest of the ingredients. Mix well and divide between the 4 reserved pie shells. Place in the oven and cook for about 40 minutes, or until nice and golden brown. Serve immediately with a side of salad. Leftover pies can be reheated or served cold.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/rustic-sweet-potato-apple-and-chestnut-tartlets-550944", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Food Fanatic", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/peanut-butter-toffee-bars-724133.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 724133, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peanut Butter Toffee Bars", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Food Fanatic", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "40-50 ritz crackers, about 2 sleeves", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "crackers", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 40.0, "id": 18621, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup creamy peanut butter, divided", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "creamy peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10116098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "milk chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 10019146, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodfanatic.com/2016/03/peanut-butter-toffee-bars/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 21, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375F.Line a 10x15-inch cookie sheet with aluminum foil, and coat with non-stick cooking spray.
