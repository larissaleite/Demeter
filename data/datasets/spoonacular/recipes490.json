With a knife, remove any black spots on the skin and cut yuzu into quarters.Remove seeds by hand and squeeze out the juice in a sieve (to catch more seeds), set over a measuring cup (or a bowl). Remove the peel by hands (peel is the entire outer covering of the citrus fruit, including the colored, exterior portion as well as the spongy, white pith beneath them.) and separate the seeds and membranes in separate bowls. See the photo below.Wrap the seeds in a cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine, or pack seeds in Japanese mesh tea bags. Set aside. Why do we keep seeds and use them for cooking? See in my Note area.Put the membranes in a large pot and fill with a plenty of water. Bring it to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes over medium heat. This precooking process is to soften the membranes and remove bitterness.Remove from heat and drain in a strainer. Let cool and chop the membranes roughly. Put them in a bowl and set aside.While cooking membranes, start slicing the peel very thinly.Put the sliced peel in a large pot and fill with a plenty of water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes over medium heat. Then remove from the heat and drain in a strainer. Set aside. This precooking process is to soften the peel and remove bitterness.

That's between 3/4 cup andone cup of mashed potatoes.The easiest way to cook the potato is to poke it all over with the tines of a fork and microwave it 4 minutes on one side, 4 minutes on the other side, on high. Let it cool, then peel it, and mash it with a fork.Or, you can boil the potato. Peel the potato, cut it into large chunks, cover it with water in a pot, bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes or so until a fork easily goes through the potatoes, drain, cool, and mash.2 Heatthe milk, whisk in mashed potato: Heat 2 cups of milk in a medium saucepan, until it is steamy, then remove from heat. Whisk in the salt, sugar, olive oil and the mashed potato.Pour into the mixing bowl of a standing mixer (or just a large bowl if you don't have a mixer), and let cool until it is still warm, but no longer hot, to the touch. (If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast in the next step.)3 Add yeast and 2 cups of flour: Stir in the yeast. Stir in 2 cups of theflour. Usea standing mixer such as a KitchenAid (recommended), attach the mixing paddle, andmix on medium high speed for 4 minutes. This will help break up any potato lumps and help incorporate the mashed potatoes into the dough.(If you are using a bread machine, put the milk potato mixture, the yeast, and all of the flour into the bread machine and knead for 8minutes, skip the next step and proceed to step 5.)4 Add the remaining flour and knead: Swap out the mixing paddle for the dough hook on your mixer. Add the remaining 3 cups of flour and mix on medium low speed for 8minutes. The dough should be rather loose and a little tacky.5 Put dough into a large bowl, let dough rise: Rub the inside of a large bowl with some olive oil. Transferthe dough from the mixing bowl and put it into this large bowl (can use your mixing bowl if you clean it, and coat the inside with oil). Gently coat the top of the dough with a little olive oil.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dampened towel (to prevent the dough from drying out). Place in a warm spot for 2 hours or overnight. The dough should at least double in size. You'll know when it has risen sufficiently when you press into the top with your fingertip and the indentation remains for a while.6 Punch down the dough, place in loaf pans: Press down on the dough with your hand to deflate it. Turn it out onto a clean lightly floured surface and knead a couple of times. Cut the dough into two halves (a pastry scraper comes in handy for this). Rub a little olive oil inside of two 8x4-inch loaf pans. Place a dough half in each and press the dough into the bottom of the pans. 7 Let dough rise again: Coat the top of the loaves with a little olive oil. Cover the loaf pans with plastic wrap and put in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour or longer, until the dough has doubled in size.8 Bake: Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Remove the plastic wrap from the loaf pans and gently place the loaf pans in the oven in the middle rack. Bake for 35 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature is between 190 and 200F.While the bread is still warm in the pan, use a dull dinner knife and run along the edge of the panbetween the pan and the bread to loosen the bread from the pan.

Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup flour in to the dough, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. You can also do all the mixing and kneading in your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat.

Place half the dough aside for another use or freeze for later. With the remaining dough roll/press into two medium size round pizzas (I like to divide my dough in half (again) and make two medium pizza's rather than one large.

Whisk together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Set aside. 2. Cream shortening, 2/3 cup sugar, and brown sugar with electric mixer until fluffy. Add rice milk, and beat until smooth. Beat in molasses. Add flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time, beating after each addition, until soft dough forms. 3. Divide dough in half. Transfer each dough half to large sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper. Use plastic wrap to shape dough into 2 2-inch-diameter logs. Wrap tightly, and chill 2 hours, or overnight. 4. To bake cookies: Preheat oven to 350\u00baF. Place remaining 1/2 cup sugar in shallow bowl. Slice dough logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices, rolling logs 90 degrees between slices to keep edges round. Dip one side of each slice in sugar, and place sugar-side up on greased or parchment paper\u2013lined baking sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies are crackled and dry on top.
