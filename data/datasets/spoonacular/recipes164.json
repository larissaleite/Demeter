Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper.Fit a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.Put milk, butter, and salt in a heavy bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally with a spatula.  Once the milk boils, remove from heat a wooden spoon to stir in the gluten-free flour mix.  Return dough to heat. Keep stirring until a mass of dough forms and a film of starch forms on the bottom of the pan.Dump the dough into the mixer bowl and turn on low.  Stir until the outside of the bowl is no longer hot, 3 - 5 minutes.Meanwhile, beat the eggs together. Turn the mixer to medium speed and add in three additions to the dough making sure the egg fully incorporates before adding more.  You many not need all of the egg. You want the dough to be smooth, shiny, and it just slightly should slide down the beaters when you stop the mixer.  Put a little dough between your thumb and first finger \u2013 when you pull your fingers apart the dough should stretch and hold it\u2019s shape.

Butter a 13x9 inch baking dish.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season liberally with salt. While you're waiting for the water to boil, prep all your veggies.Prepare the green beans by cutting the green beans into 2-3 pieces, depending on the size of your green beans. The size of the beans should be small enough to fit on a fork. Blanch the green beans in the boiling water for just 1-2 minutes, scoop them out of the water with a slotted spoon. Set the green beans aside.Cook the pasta in the same boiling, salted water until al dente, so that it still has some toothsomeness to it. Be careful not to overcook the pasta, since it will still be cooking in the oven. Drain the pasta and toss it with some oil so that the pasta doesn't stick together.In a large skillet, heat up 1/2 a Tablespoon of oil and add the chopped onion. Season with salt and pepper and cook the onions for about 5 minutes, until it's softened.Add the ground beef.I  use lean ground beef, since I don't want my casserole to be too greasy. Season with salt and pepper and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the meat is no longer pink and starts to caramelize a bit. Pour in the chicken broth to deglaze the pan, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.Instead of ground beef, you can use ground pork, any kind of sausage that you like, ground chicken, or even browned bits of any meat. You can also add some mushrooms here if you'd like.Spread the meat evenly onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle part of the minced parsley over the beef. Top the meat with half of the cooked pasta.Meanwhile, saute the vegetables. In the same skillet, add 1 Tablespoon of oil, and cook the sliced onion, seasoned with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes.Add the carrots and celery, season with salt and pepper and cook for another 3-5 minutes, until the carrots are softened.Add the zucchini and the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook for another 2-4 minutes, just until the zucchini and tomatoes release their juices.Make a little room on the bottom of the skillet, add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.Add the blanched green beans and the minced sweet cheery peppers. Spread the vegetables over the layer of pasta in the baking dish and top with the remaining pasta.In another large bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk, season with about 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Pour it over the casserole.Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes, until the casserole is bubbly.While the casserole is baking, add the butter and the panko bread crumbs to a skillet and cook on medium heat until the breadcrumbs are toasted and golden brown.Sprinkle the toasted breadcrumbs over the casserole and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
