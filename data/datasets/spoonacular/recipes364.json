Use a spatula to combine everything together as best as possible, and then use your hands to finish kneading the ingredients into a single ball of dough. Turn dough out onto the counter and knead for about 10 minutes, until soft and elastic, incorporating up to another 4 1/4 ounces (1 cup, spoon and level) bread flour as needed to prevent the dough from getting stuck to your hands or the counter. Shape into a smooth ball, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes. Grease an 9\" x 13\" baking dish with nonstick spray. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (I like to do this by weight) and shape each portion into a ball by stretching the dough out with your palms to form a smooth top and pinching the edges together underneath. Cup the sides of the dough ball in your palms and rotate it gently to further smooth it out. Arrange balls of dough in the prepared baking dish in a 3x4 pattern. Cover with greased plastic wrap and leave to rise for about 45 minutes, until the dough is taking up most of the space in the baking dish and reaches the rim of the dish at its highest point.

Add the cubed butter and allow to melt and cool while  and prepping the mashed potatoes [see recipe notes] and mixing the dry ingredients. In a bowl, whisk together 1 lb 3 1/8 ounces (4 1/2 cups, spoon and level) bread flour with the yeast, sugar, and salt. Combine the mashed potatoes with the milk/butter mixture and whisk together until smooth. Make sure the temperature registers between 120-130F before adding to the dry ingredients. If needed, heat briefly in the microwave or allow to cool to reach desired temperature. Add the potato mixture to the dry ingredients along with the egg. Use a spatula to combine everything together as best as possible, and then use your hands to finish kneading the ingredients into a single ball of dough. Turn dough out onto the counter and knead for about 10 minutes, until soft and elastic, incorporating up to another 4 1/4 ounces (1 cup, spoon and level) bread flour as needed to prevent the dough from getting stuck to your hands or the counter. Shape into a smooth ball, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes. Grease an 9\" x 13\" baking dish with nonstick spray. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (I like to do this by weight) and shape each portion into a ball by stretching the dough out with your palms to form a smooth top and pinching the edges together underneath.
