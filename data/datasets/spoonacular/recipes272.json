Leftover fritatta may be wrapped in plasticwrap or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.Fritatta is vegetarian and gluten-free, provided soup used, or any optional ingredients used, are vegetarian and gluten-free.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creamy-and-crispy-hash-browns-frittata-vegetarian-gluten-free-520007", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Spicy Perspective", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Watermelon-Cocktail-611130.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 611130, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Watermelon Cocktail", "preparationMinutes": 3, "pricePerServing": 451.86, "creditText": "A Spicy Perspective", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 oz Gin (or Vodka)", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "gin", "metaInformation": ["(or Vodka)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vermouth.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10514037, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups fresh watermelon juice", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1019016, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "10 Mint Leaves (+ extra for garnish)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mint leaves", "metaInformation": ["for garnish)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-balm.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 10.0, "id": 2064, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Soda Water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "soda water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water-sparkling.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14121, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "1 oz Watermelon Shrub", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "watermelon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/watermelon.jpg", "unitLong": "ounce", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9326, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup white balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "white balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1012069, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 31.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.aspicyperspective.com/2014/09/watermelon-cocktail.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 49, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "To make the Watermelon Shrub: Juice enough watermelon to yield two cups of juice.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/watermelon.jpg", "id": 9326, "name": "watermelon"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-juice.jpg", "id": 1019016, "name": "juice"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add  cup of sugar and  cup of white balsamic vinegar to the watermelon juice.

Place both bowls in the fridge until everything is ready to be assembled.Spread a layer (about 1/2 inch thick) of whipped cream all along the bottom and sides of the pan. Place a layer of graham crackers on top (as many as you can fit), spread with whipped cream, top with sprinkles, then place another layer of grahams. Spread a layer (again, about 1/2 inch thick) of pudding over the grahams, then place another layer of grahams. Repeat until you reach the top, making sure to push whipped cream and pudding down the open sides, then end with a layer of whipped cream. Place in the freezer, freezing at least 4-6 hours, or overnight. Place remaining whipped cream in the freezer.Remove from freezer and lift the cake out, flipping over onto a small pan or cutting board that will fit in the freezer. Spread whipped cream all over cake for a finishing presentation, then cover in sprinkles. Freeze for at least another 2 hours, or as long as needed. When ready, cut and serve immediately. Additionally you can just scoop it out of the pan and serve it in bowls.
