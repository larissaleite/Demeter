Add the figs, pistachios, salt and pepper; continue cooking for another 5 minutes, or until the figs and shallots begin to caramelize slightly. Stir in the port and increase the heat slightly, continuing to stir until the port has reduced and the mixture is very syrupy. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.While the fig stuffing is cooling, butterfly the chicken breasts - lay a chicken breast on a cutting board in front of you, smooth side down. Remove the tenderloin, if necessary; you will probably be able to simply pull it off, although you may need to cut it free at one end. Save the tenderloin for another use.Turn the breast over with the narrow, pointed tip facing you and the thinner side opposite your cutting hand. Place your hand on top of the breast. Carefully insert the knife into the thickest part of the breast, and draw it almost all the way through the breast. Take care to keep the breast attached on one side.Open the breast like a book and, if needed, use the broad side of a cook\u2019s knife or the smooth side of a meat mallet to even out the butterflied breast, by lightly pounding the flesh until it\u2019s an even thickness. Repeat with the second breast; season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the surface of the each chicken breast evenly with the prosciutto.Combine the goat cheese and herbs de Provence in a small bowl until well-blended. Divide the mixture in half and gently spread each portion thinly over the prosciutto covering the chicken breasts. Divide the fig stuffing and mound on each breast, spreading it down the center. Fold the chicken over the stuffing and tie at intervals with kitchen twine to hold it closed. Sprinkle the surface with salt, pepper and the chopped thyme.Place each breast on a lightly oiled baking sheet seam side up, and bake for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked and the stuffing is heated through. Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes before serving.While the chicken is cooking, heat the pan the fig stuffing was prepared in over medium-high heat. Deglaze with the remaining 1/2 cup of port, scraping up the bits from the surface of the pan, until reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Stir in the clarified butter and set aside.Remove the kitchen twine and cut each chicken breast in half through the center slightly on the bias. Plate each half, drizzle with the port/butter sauce and serve.Nutrition (per serving): 486 calories, 26g total fat, 98.7mg cholesterol, 541.4mg sodium, 530.1mg potassium, 16.1g carbohydrates, 3.6g

Add 2 teaspoons salt and garlic, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until beans are tender, 30 to 60 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            If storing the beans, cool completely, transfer beans and some of the cooking liquid to quart-sized zipper-lock bags. When ready to use, thaw out in refrigerator and heat on stovetop in saucepan or microwave.                                                                                                                            4                                                                             For the rice: Heat  2 tablespoons oil in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add 2/3 of onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                               5                                                                            Add rice and cook, stirring, until grains are shiny and evenly coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water or broth and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Place bell pepper on top of rice.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Boil rice without stirring until most of the liquid has evaporated and you can see small bubbles bursting on the surface of the rice. Immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook (do not stir, do not remove lid) for 15 minutes. Remove and discard bell pepper. Fluff rice with chopsticks or fork, then let cool and refrigerate for 1 day.                                                                                                                            7                                                                             For the gallopinto: Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Add rice and 2 cups beans to skillet and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated. Continue to cook, stirring, to allow flavors to meld and mixture to become slightly crisp, about 10 minutes. Cover and cook over low heat an additional 10 minutes.
