When the wood is ignited and producing smoke, place the ribs in the smoker or grill, meat side up. Smoke until ribs darken to a deep mahogany, about 3 hours, misting with apple juice in a squirt bottle every hour.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wrap each rack, meat side up, in extra-large heavy duty aluminum foil, leaving an opening on one end of foil. Pour 1/2 cup of apple juice in each foil pack through opening, seal, and place back on smoker or grill for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Remove ribs from foil and place ribs back in smoker and continue to cook until ribs have a slight bend when lifted from one end, 1 to 2 hours more, squirting with apple juice every hour. Remove ribs from smoker or grill, wrap in foil, and place in an empty cooler to keep warm while preparing the grill.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over entire surface of coal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Remove racks from foil and brush with barbecue sauce. Place ribs face down over hot fire and cook until sauce caramelizes, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove racks from grill.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For extra sweet and shiny ribs: Tear off two more large sheets of aluminum foil longer than each rack. In a rectangle the approximate size of each rack of ribs, spread 1/4 cup of agave syrup and sprinkle \u00bc cup brown sugar on top of agave on each piece of foil.

Make the baharat-spiced sugar: Toast the black peppercorns, cumin seeds, coriander seeds and cloves in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the spices cool. Transfer the spices along with the paprika, cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg to a splice blender and pulse until smooth. Makes  cup.2. In a large bowl, combine the sugar with 2 teaspoon baharat spice mix and set aside.3. Make the sufganiyot: Combine the bread flour and dry active yeast in a mixing bowl and set aside.4. In another mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; set aside.5. Place the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the wet ingredients and mix on low for 10 to 12 minutes until the dough comes together and looks like a shaggy ball.6. Spray the bottom of a large bowl with nonstick spray. Place the dough inside and cover it with a damp kitchen towel. Set the bowl in a warm part of the kitchen for 45 minutes. Remove the dough and gently fold over 3 times. Place the dough back in the bowl; cover and place in a warm place for an additional 45 minutes.7. Meanwhile, make the hot espresso fudge: In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour until well incorporated. Add the cream, salt, sugars, cocoa powder and vanilla extract and bring to simmer. Cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chocolate chips, orange zest and espresso and whisk until the chocolate is melted and the sauce is smooth and glossy, another 2 minutes.8. Remove the dough and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll dough out to -inch-thick rectangle and cut out circles using a 2-inch ring mold. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet; cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit for 15 minutes.9. Meanwhile, pour enough oil into a 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot until it reaches a depth of 3 inches. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer reads 350.10. Fry the doughnuts in batches of 4 or 5 until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the doughnuts using a slotted spoon and toss with the baharat-spiced sugar while still warm.11. Serve the warm doughnuts with the fudge dipping sauce on the side.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baharat-spiced-sufganiyot-with-espresso-fudge-622996", "vegetarian": false,

"weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "aggregateLikes": 960, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 8 cake rounds. Line them with parchment paper and then grease the pans again, then flour them. (See note)Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.Add melted butter to a large bowl and mix in sugar with a hand mixer for 30 seconds until thick and yellow. Add eggs one at at time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla bean paste.Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately, starting and ending with the flour. Dont over mix! Divide batter among cake pans. Bake for 24-28 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely before removing from pans to frost.At this point, you can decide how you want to fill the cake. You can use the two layers as-is or you can torte them for a 4-layer cake. Note: if you do not torte the layers, you can cut the recipe for the peanut butter filling in half.Make the filling: beat peanut butter with 1 cup of powdered sugar (using a hand or a stand mixer). Add the second cup of powdered sugar and mix, the mixture will be crumbly. Add vanilla and 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. Mix until smooth. Add another 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and mix until smooth. Add the rest of the heavy whipping cream a little bit at a time and beat until the mixture becomes a frosting like texture. (Youll notice a change - it will go from thick like a peanut butter cup to smooth like frosting during that last addition of the cream.)Place the bottom cake layer on serving plate. Divide your filling and fill between each layer.Make the frosting: mix cocoa and melted butter with a hand mixer. Add powdered sugar (1 cup at a time) and optional salt, if using. Mix between powdered sugar additions - the mixture will be clumpy. Add the vanilla and 1 ounce of the heavy whipping cream. Mix until smooth. Continue adding the heavy whipping cream until your desired thickness has formed - about 3 ounces (just over 1/4 cup).Use a small amount of frosting to create a crumb coat on the outside of the cake. This will ensure that you will not have cake crumbs in your final frosting layer. The crumb coat just uses a very small amount of frosting and is very thin all over the cake. Then frost as normal using the remaining frosting. Top with sprinkles, if desired.The cake is best served at room temperature but I would store it in the refrigerator if you make it ahead of time, then let it come to room temperature before serving. Can be made up to 1 day ahead.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/perfect-yellow-cake-with-chocolate-frosting-and-peanut-butter-filling-612823", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).2. Cut out the base of the cabbage and discard, and then cut the cabbage into quarters. Wash it under cold running water, then boil for 15 to 20 minutes in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water with the carrots, diced salt pork or bacon, and the bouquet garni. Drain in a colander. Discard the bouquet garni.3. Place just the cabbage in a roasting pan in the oven to dry out for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and reserve with the salt pork and carrots.4. Clean the bird(s); if using freshly killed partridges, pluck them just before cooking. Cover the thighs and breast of each bird with the slices of salt pork or bacon and attach with kitchen string. Sprinkle generously with pepper, but salt lightly because of the pork.5. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a pot large enough to hold comfortably the bird(s), and cook for 10 minutes, turning frequently to brown evenly. Cover the pot and finish cooking, 20 to 25 minutes for the partridges, or 35 minutes for a guinea hen, turning from time to time. Remove the pot from the heat but leave the bird(s) inside, covered, for 5 minutes more.6.

"instructions": "In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.Rub the seasoning all over the chicken (start with only half and add more rub as needed- that way you can save the rest and it won't be contaminated by raw chicken) breasts, place them in a dish, cover, and refrigerate until you're ready to cook.To cook the chicken, heat an outdoor grill to about 450. Make sure the surface is scrubbed clean. You can oil the cooking grates if you want but I've found if you start with a HOT HOT surface it #1) won't stick and #2) will seal in the juices so you have tender juicy grilled chicken.When the grill is hot, lift the lid and place the chicken on the grates. Close the lid and cook for about 2-3 minutes.Flip the chicken, close the lid, and cook on the second side for 2-3 more minutes.Reduce the grill heat (if you're cooking with gas; if you're using charcoal just move the breasts away from the most direct heat) Flip the chicken again (if you turn it you can create that professional-looking criss-cross pattern on the outside). Cook for 5-7 minutes. After about 3 minutes, brush on the BBQ sauce and close the lid again.Flip, and cook for approximately 5 more minutes, brushing on the BBQ sauce after about 2 minutes. COOK TIMES ARE NOT EXACT. Always make sure that your chicken has an internal temperature of 165. If you do not have a meat thermometer then cut the chicken open at the thickest spot and make sure the juices run clear. My chicken breasts are usually on the thicker side so cook times are a little longer.When the chicken is done, remove it to a plate and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.Pour the warm water into a large bowl. Stir in the active dry yeast and let it sit for a minute until it has dissolved. Add the flour and kosher salt. Stir until a shaggy dough forms. Scatter a little extra flour on the counter, turn out the dough (including the little loose scraps) and gently knead for 5 minutes. The dough will be slightly tacky-- toss more flour on the counter while kneading as needed.Throw the dough back in the bowl (don't worry about cleaning it), dump the olive oil over the dough, and cover the bowl with a towel.Heat the grill. I mean HEAT it. I let mine get up to 500 degrees before cooking.While the grill heats, whisk together the BBQ sauce and ranch dressing.Gather up your ingredients-- the sauce you just mixed and ALL the toppings. Head outside.Sort of slosh the dough around in the olive oil and then divide it in half. Stretch one half into a circular shape. Shape really isn't important-- one of my pizzas was like a triangle. Thickness IS important! You should end up with about a 10\" pizza-- if you let the middle get too thin it will burn.Toss the dough onto the hot grill. Close the lid. Cook for 2-3 minutes.Remove the dough to your work surface UNCOOKED SIDE DOWN.On the cooked side spread out half the BBQ sauce mixture. Top with  cup of the cheese, half the chicken, half the red onions, half the Roma tomatoes, half the fresh pineapple, and half the Serrano peppers.Put the pizza back on the grill and cook for another 3 or 4 minutes.Remove to a cutting board and let it rest for a minute before cutting.Repeat the process with the second pizza.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/grilled-bbq-chicken-pizza-518423", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 21, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Caf\u00e9 Johnsonia", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Roasted-Pineapple-Coconut-Vegan-Milkshake-604736.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 604736, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Roasted Pineapple Coconut Vegan Milkshake", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Caf\u00e9 Johnsonia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "brown sugar, for sprinkling", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["for sprinkling"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup evaporated cane juice", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "evaporated cane juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/evaporated-cane-juice.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93625, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 can full fat coconut milk", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "full fat coconut milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cans", "unitShort": "can", "amount": 2.0, "id": 12118, "unit": "can"}, {"originalString": "4 cups coconut ice cream", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "ice cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-ice-cream.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19095, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc pineapple, cut into \u00bc-inch slices lengthwise", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "pineapple", "metaInformation": ["cut into \u00bc-inch slices lengthwise"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.25, "id": 9266, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 Tablespoon rum (optional)", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "rum", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-rum.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 2.0, "id": 14037, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "pinch salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 vanilla bean, scraped, seeds only", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla bean", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93622, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 37.0, "sourceUrl": "http://cafejohnsonia.com/2014/07/roasted-pineapple-coconut-vegan-milkshake.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 20, "aggregateLikes": 145, "instructions": "Combine coconut milk, cane juice, vanilla bean, and pinch salt in a blender.

Lightly press on the cheese to ensure it sticks. Cut each round into 12 wedges with a pizza cutter or chef's knife. Starting from the wide ends, roll up each wedge. Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheets, bending the ends slightly to create a crescent. Loosely cover with plastic wrap; let stand until puffy, about 45 minutes.Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Combine the sesame seeds, poppy seeds and salt in a small bowl. Brush the crescents with the remaining beaten egg and sprinkle with the seed mixture. Bake, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until the rolls are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.Photograph by Ryan Liebe                                                            Yeast Tips Check the label: Make sure you use the type of yeast in the recipe. Active dry yeast is not interchangeable with rapid-rise or instant yeast.Use a thermometer: Don't guess the heat of the liquid you're adding; take its temperature. It must be at least 110 degrees F to activate the yeast. Watch your dough: Rising times can vary depending on the heat of your kitchen. Use the times as a guideline and follow visual cues for all the steps.

Thoroughly wash the chicken and place it in the pot. Add the water (enough to submerge everything with 2 inches of water on top), the onion, the bunch of dill (tied with a string), celery and salt. Bring to a boil and skim off the foam that will form on top. Discard the foam, continue to cook on medium-high heat until the foam stops appearing. Lower the heat to medium-low and add ginger, the turnip, the parsnip, carrots and the lemon juice. Cover and cook over very low heat for 2 hours.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            After 2 hours, taste the broth and see if you want more salt, or other seasonings in it. Pull the chicken out. It should be falling apart and falling off the bone. Pull the bones out and discard, and cut up the chicken in pieces. Place half of the chicken back in the soup and half put aside for chicken salad the next day. Ever-so-slightly increase the heat and add the potatoes. While the potatoes cook, start on the matzo balls.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            To make matzo balls: In a large bowl, mix together the matzo meal, eggs, vegetable oil, seltzer, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Take the matzo ball mix out of the refrigerator and place by the stove where your soup is simmering. Place a bowl of cold water next to your matzo ball mix\u2014you will need to dip your hands in it so that the matzo meal won\u2019t stick to your palms.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Grab a bit of the mix and roll it in your palms to a ball about 1 inch in diameter.

Add the fava beans and blanch for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and place in an ice bath. Peel the skins off the favas; the beans will split into 2 bright green pieces as you pop them out of their skins.In a food processor, combine the peeled favas, pecorino, garlic, parsley/mint mixture, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and EVOO. Pulse into a thick spread. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Season with a little flaky sea salt.For the frico: mix the 2 cups of pecorino with a tablespoon of flour. Divide the mixture into small piles on a silpat-lined sheet tray. Place in oven until golden and melted together, about 10 minutes. Remove with a spatula.Slice your bread into thin slices. Drizzle with good olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Place in oven until crisp and golden. Serve the spread on the charred small toasts. Place a frico standing up on each crostini.

the glaze, combine all ingredients well. Taste it and adjust to your liking. It should be pretty strong if you are tasting it by itself.3) For all the vegetables, be sure to mince them very finely. If you have a food processor, it's easiest to pulse them a few times in that.4) Add a small drizzle of oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, peppers, and garlic to the pan and cook until veggies soften, just a few minutes.5) Once veggies are cooked, add them to a large bowl with all the other meatloaf ingredients. Use your hands to really mix everything together well. 6) Pack the meatloaf into a 9x5 loaf pan. Then invert the pan on a baking sheet (I like to line mine with parchment for easy cleanup).7) Bake the meatloaf free-form for 15 minutes, then remove it and coat it with some glaze every 15-20 minutes. The meatloaf will need to bake for 60-70 minutes to be cooked through. 8) Let the meatloaf cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

Reduce heat to low; keep warm and stir occasionally.                                                                                            In a double boiler over simmering water, constantly whisk the egg yolk, lemon juice and water until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a metal spoon. Reduce heat to low. Slowly drizzle in melted butter, whisking constantly. Whisk in milk mixture. Serve immediately.                                        Yield: about 3/4 cup.

Place the butter, liqueur, and chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat, then set the chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally with the spatula until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove and let cool slightly while you whip the eggs.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Place the eggs and 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar in the bowl of the mixer and whip on high speed until very light in color and thick, 5 to 6 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl, though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture into the eggs and whip until blended, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Place the flour, nuts, cinnamon, baking powder, and chile powder (if using) in the food processor and process until the nuts are very finely chopped, 60 to 90 seconds. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and beat on low speed just until combined. Stir gently a few times with the spatula to make sure there are no patches of unincorporated flour or butter lurking near the bottom of the bowl. Cover the dough with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, until firm.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F and position an oven rack in the center. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Scoop the chilled dough into tablespoon-size balls using the ice cream scoop or a spoon. Place the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar in one small bowl and the confectioners' sugar in the other. Roll each dough ball in the granulated sugar and then in the confectioners' sugar. Be sure to coat the dough generously with the confectioners' sugar\u2014in this instance, more is better. Space the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bake the cookies one sheet at a time, rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time, for 11 to 14 minutes, until the cookies are puffed and cracked. If you nudge a cookie, it should slide on the sheet rather than stick. It is better to slightly underbake these cookies than to go too far--when overbaked they are dry and unpalatable. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Storing tips:These cookies are best the same day they are baked.

pepper flakes, 2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl; whisk until smooth. Place the lamb on a rimmed baking sheet or in a roasting pan; poke about 10 slits into each side with the tip of a paring knife. Rub the marinade all over the lamb, massaging it into the meat and slits. Cover and refrigerate overnight.Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature about 1 hour before roasting. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and set a rack in a roasting pan. Wipe any excess marinade off the lamb and season all over with salt and pepper; transfer to the rack. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130 degrees F to 135 degrees F, about 1 hour 50 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board and let rest 30 to 45 minutes before carving.Meanwhile, make the mint sauce: Combine the mint, parsley, garlic, mustard, capers, lemon juice, sugar, red pepper flakes and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a blender and puree until smooth. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Carve the lamb and serve with the sauce.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                            Buy: Leg of lamb usually includes the hip bone; ask your butcher to remove it for easier carving. You'll be left with the femur and shank bones running down the center.Roast: Remove the meat from the oven when it reaches 130 degrees F to 135 degrees F. The internal temperature will rise 5 degrees F to 10 degrees F as the lamb rests, and the meat will still be pink.Carve: Hold the lamb upright by the bone, then thinly slice in a downward motion with a sharp knife.

Over low heat, warm the ingredients until the butter is melted. Gently stirring during this part is ok to help combine the ingredients - just take care not to stir too vigorously and splash the liquid high up on the sides of the pan; also, take care to use low heat for this step. Too high of heat can cause the ingredients to melt unevenly and cause the butter to separate. Once the ingredients are warmed and melted, increase the heat to medium-low (I keep my stovetop dial between a 3 and 4 the entire time; each stove is different so just keep an eye on the heat). Because these are no-stir caramels, too high of heat will burn the ingredients on the bottom. Moderate the heat of your stove so that the mixture maintains a simmer without burning. If you turn down the heat and the caramel stops simmering, simply increase the heat little by little until a good simmer is reached and then leave it there. You'll be good to go.Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 236 degrees F. Pour in the remaining 1 cup cream. Gently swirl the caramel once or twice with a wooden spoon or spatula to incorporate. Again, bring the mixture to a simmer (don't adjust the heat to sharply - I keep mine set the same as before) and cook until the thermometer registers 245 degrees F. Off the heat, carefully stir in the vanilla. It will bubble; just like before, just gently swirl with a spoon or spatula. Immediately pour the caramel into the prepared pan - don't scrape the sides, just tip the pan until no more drizzles out.

"aggregateLikes": 16, "instructions": "Make the nut crust1. Position the shelf in the center of the oven. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Tear a 15 x 18-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Invert the pan and center the foil over the pan, pressing it across the bottom and down the sides. Remove the foil, turn the pan right side up, and place the foil shell into the pan, shaping it smoothly across the bottom and snugly against the sides. Using a pastry brush, grease the bottom and sides with softened butter, taking care not to tear the foil.2. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Cool to tepid.3. Place the flour, salt, and almonds in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse eight to ten times, then process for 60 seconds, until fine and cakey. Using a fork, stir the mixture into the tepid melted butter and mix thoroughly. Divide into eight portions and place in the pan, pressing it as evenly as you can. Insert a dough scraper, small spatula, or the flat side of a plastic pastry comb between the dough and the sides of the pan to clean and even the edges. Bake the crust for 15 to 16 minutes, or until lightly browned and set on top. Let stand for 8 to 10 minutes to firm.Make the caramel topping4. Place the sugar, butter, cream, honey, and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring gently but constantly. Brush the sides of the pot with water to be sure the sugar has dissolved, then simmer for 1 minute longer.5. Mix in the candied fruits, zests, and nuts, blending well. Cook the mixture over low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and the caramel starts to darken. The thickness of the pot will determine the cooking time. Watch the sides of the pot to see the first signs of thickening.6. Immediately pour the filling onto the warm crust and spread evenly with a large buttered offset spatula, distributing the topping as best you can. Bake the Florentines for 13 to 15 minutes, until bubbly on top and the surface has begun to brown. Do not overbake. Cool on a wire rack.Top with chocolate7. Melt the chocolate in a water bath (note below). When the chocolate is almost melted, stir in the vegetable oil. Do not let the chocolate mixture get too hot. Keep the chocolate warm while you unmold the Florentines, gently stirring occasionally.8. Lift the Florentine bar from the pan, using the foil as an aid, and place it on a cutting board or flat surface. Before you web the bar with chocolate, cut the bar in half and slide each half off the foil.9. Pour the warm chocolate into a plastic squeeze bottle or an 8-inch pastry bag fitted with a #2 standard writing tip.

Grease a 10-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon butter and line exterior of pan with foil. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon Maldon salt over pan bottom.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pulse the sugar with 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 teaspoon tea.
