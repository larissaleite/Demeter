If using fresh corn, cut the kernels off the cob and blanch them for 3 minutes in boiling salted water. Drain. (If using frozen corn you can skip this step.) Add the corn to the soup, then add the half-and-half and cheddar. Cook for 5 more minutes, until the cheese is melted. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Serve hot with a garnish of bacon.                                                    1999, The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

Set aside.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, whisk to combine and set aside. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together yogurt, milk, and vanilla. Pour melted butter in one steady stream while whisking to emulsify. Stir in lemon zest, then fold in lemon pieces. Add wet mixture to dry and gently fold together until just combined. Pour into prepared pan and bake until a skewer or paring knife inserted in center comes out slightly moist but not covered in batter, 20 to 25 minutes, turning once half way through baking. Allow cake to cool for 3 to 5 minutes before running a paring knife around the edge and inverting onto a plate or serving platter.
