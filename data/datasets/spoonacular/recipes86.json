Reduce the heat to medium low; simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and rose water. Pour into a large liquid measuring cup or heatproof bowl and refrigerate until ready to use (or up to 1 day).Make the baklava: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Pulse the nuts, confectioners' sugar and cinnamon in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the vanilla and salt.Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Trim the phyllo to 9 by 13 inches with kitchen shears (fig. A); cover with a damp towel. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo in the prepared baking dish and brush with butter. Repeat with 5 more sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet. Scatter about 3/4 cup of the nut mixture evenly over the phyllo stack. Top with 2 more sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet, then top with another 3/4 cup of the nut mixture. Repeat to make 2 more layers (use 2 sheets of buttered phyllo and 3/4 cup nut mixture for each layer), then top with the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet (fig. B). Scatter the remaining nut mixture on top.Cut the baklava into 32 triangles (fig. C). Transfer to the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 40 minutes (tent with foil if the nuts are browning too quickly).Remove from the oven and pour the prepared syrup evenly over the top. Let the syrup soak in, at least 2 hours.Photograph by Ryan Liebe                                                            Thaw: Place the frozen phyllo in its packaging in the refrigerator overnight (do not thaw in the microwave).Trim: After opening the package, use kitchen shears to trim any edges that are dry or clumped together.Transfer: As you move individual sheets of phyllo, place one hand underneath them to help prevent tearing.Cover: Keep the phyllo covered with a slightly damp kitchen towel while you're working; the sheets can dry out quickly.Store: Stack leftover phyllo on a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel, then wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days; do not refreeze.

of salt. Whisk over a double boiler until yolk is steaming and hot to the touch. This will kill any bacteria that is in the egg. (Note: If you want to be 100% sure, you need to hold the egg at 138 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes.)2) Once the egg is off the heat, very slowly start whisking in oil. Start with just a drop of oil and slowly add more. If the egg has curdled at all from the double boiler, whisk in a few drops of water. Keep whisking oil in slowly until it's all incorporated and the mayo is a very thick consistency. Season with Sriracha if you want.3) Season bacon strips with lots of fresh black pepper and bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes, flipping once while cooking.4) Lightly toast bread.5) Start sandwich by slathering one piece of bread with mayo and topping with a few turkey slices. Top turkey with lettuce and add your second piece of bread.6) Slather second piece of bread with mayo and top with tomato slices and bacon. Slather top piece of bread with mayo and top sandwich.7) Stick sandwich with skewers, one per corner.8) Cut sandwich into four pieces, each piece being held by a skewer.

If the dressing is too thick, blend in additional water 1 tablespoon at a time; season with additional salt if needed.At this point the corn should be done.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium heat. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook until the mushroom water is evaporated and they begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add chicken, cumin, chili powder and oregano and stir until all spices are incorporated. Add spinach, salt and pepper and cook until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Lay 1 tortilla on a flat work surface and sprinkle with 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Spoon 1/2 chicken and vegetable mixture on top of cheese, then top with an additional 1/4 cup cheese. Top with another flour tortilla. Heat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray over medium heat. Carefully place 1 quesadilla in pan and cook 3 minutes. Using a large spatula, gently flip quesadilla and cook an additional 3 minutes until lightly browned and cheese is melted. Repeat with second quesadilla. Slice each quesadilla into quarters. Place 2 quarters on a plate with 1 tablespoon sour cream and 2 tablespoons salsa.                                                    Eating Healthy in 2009.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook, stirring after 1 minute, until about three-quarters of the way done.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook until just beginning to turn golden brown, then add the parsley. Add a ladle of the pasta water to stop the cooking process and allow the flavors to combine.When the pasta is three-quarters of the way cooked, remove it from the water and add it to the saute pan. Add more pasta water as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, letting the liquid reduce as the pasta finishes to form a sauce.Season with salt if desired and transfer to a large serving dish.

Using a spoon, scoop out and discard the seeds and strings from each half. Then, with a large, sharp knife, cut each melon half into slices about 1/4-inch thick.With a paring knife, neatly cut away the rind and any hard, pale or green flesh from each slice, leaving just the ripe orange fruit. Arrange the cantaloupe slices in a large, shallow dish.\u00a0For the ice wine dressing:\u00a0In a small bowl, stir together the wine, olive oil, Champagne vinegar and balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper.Drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dressing over the cantaloupe slices and turn the slices to coat evenly. (At this point, the dish may be covered and refrigerated for no more than 1 hour before continuing.)\u00a0For assembly:Divide the cantaloupe slices evenly among individual serving plates. Drape 1 prosciutto slice over the cantaloupe slices on each plate.Put the mache leaves in the shallow dish you used for dressing the cantaloupe slices, add the remaining dressing, and toss until the leaves are evenly coated.Arrange the mache attractively on each plate, dividing it evenly.

In a medium bowl, stir together the apple cider, apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, lemon juice, jalapeno, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper.

Keep the temperature of the grill or smoker from going below 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).

Place ramekins into the oven and bake for 45-60 minutes or until bread pudding is set, golden brown on top and no longer wobbly inside.5. While the bread pudding is baking, prepare the dreamy custard sauce. In a medium saucepan, stir together milk and salt. Bring mixture to a boil while stirring very frequently. In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until light and pale, about 2 minutes. Once milk has come to a boil, reduce heat to low and pour 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the beaten egg mixture while whisking constantly. Once combined, pour egg mixture into the remaining milk in the saucepan - whisking vigorously as well. Continue to whisk mixture while it cooks over low heat until it begins to thicken, about 3-4 minutes. Make sure your heat is in low. Too high and your eggs will start to curdle. Pour custard sauce into a syrup dispenser and serve alongside bread pudding while still warm.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Butter three 8-inch (or 9-inch) round cake pans, line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper, then butter the parchment. Lightly dust the cake pans with flour, shaking out excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.Using a small food processor (or in a bowl, using your fingers), process one cup sugar with the orange zest. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together on medium-high speed the orange sugar, the remaining cup of granulated sugar, and the butter. Beat until light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and Grand Marnier, and continue beating the mixture for another 5 minutes.Reduce mixer speed to low, then add flour mixture alternating with yogurt, in three batches, beginning and ending with flour. Mix just until smooth. Divide the batter equally among the three cake pans, rap the pans once or twice on the counter to get rid of any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each layer comes out clean, about 20-25 minutes for 9-inch cake pans or 25-30 minutes for 8-inch pans, rotating cake layers about halfway through baking time. Cool layers in pans for about 10 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edge of each and invert layers onto cooling racks to cool completely. (Note: Layers can be made in advance. Bake up to 1 week ahead, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, store individual layers in a plastic freezer bag, and freeze. Thaw layers overnight in refrigerator the night before you plan to assemble the cake.)Prepare FrostingIn the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low and slowly add confectioners' sugar. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine orange zest, orange juice, vanilla, and salt; stir until salt is dissolved, then add to the butter mixture. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. If you desire, add a drop or two of food coloring to tint the frosting.(Note: Frosting can be made ahead, up to 2 days, and refrigerated in a tightly covered container. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes when ready to use. Beat on medium-low in stand mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.)Assemble CakeTo frost cakes, place 1 layer on a cake plate. With an offset spatula, spread top with about 1 cup of frosting. Place the second cake layer on top, and repeat. Place third layer on top and spread frosting in a thin layer over the sides and top of the cake. Chill briefly in refrigerator, until frosting is firm, then spread sides and top with the remaining frosting. You will end up with a bit of leftover frosting which can be used for additional decorating if you like.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/orange-creamsicle-cake-587442",

stirring just until the sugar dissolves. Cook, gently swirling the pan but not stirring, until amber, about 10 minutes. Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the butter, heavy cream, bourbon, lemon juice and kosher salt (the mixture will bubble). Pour into a bowl and set aside.Make the bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Spread the bread cubes on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry and golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely.Whisk the eggs, sugar and kosher salt in a large bowl, then whisk in the milk, heavy cream and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the toasted bread and the banana slices. Transfer half of the mixture to the prepared baking dish and spread in an even layer. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of the caramel, then top with the remaining bread mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Cover and refrigerate the remaining caramel until ready to serve.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the bread pudding with sea salt and bake until golden brown and set, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Warm the remaining caramel and drizzle on top.Photograph by Kana Okada                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

Knead the dough for several minutes until smooth. Then divide the dough into a long log. Cut around 12 equal portions out. Take one portion and wrap filling-red bean paste. Assemble as a ball firstly and slightly press with hand to make a flat cake. To deep-fry: Heat up oil in wok or pot until really hot, brush some water on the surface and then coat the cake with bread crumbs. Lower your fire and slide the cake in the hot oil and fry until both sides becomes crispy and golden brown. Be careful during this process. Use kitchen pepper to remove extra oil. If some of the coating drops out in deep-frying process, remove them before the next batch. For a crispier taste and less oil absorbed, re-fry the cakes for around 20 seconds over medium fire. To pan-fry: brush some oil on a pan and then fry the cake over low fire until golden brown in both sides. Set aside to cool down a little bite.
