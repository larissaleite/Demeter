"aggregateLikes": 30, "instructions": "Prepare the vanilla bean gelato ahead of time by combining the whisked egg yolks, milk, scraped vanilla bean and seeds, and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (this should happen well before it would begin to simmer). Transfer the gelato base to a bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming, and allow it to chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours. Once it is cold, pour it through a fine mesh strainer to remove the vanilla bean, then churn the gelato in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Transfer the mixture to a sealed container and place it in the freezer until it reaches the desired firmness. The pie crust should also be prepared in advance by stirring together the flour and salt in a medium or large mixing bowl until combined. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cold butter into the dry ingredients until the pieces are pea-size. Add the ice cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and use a fork to gently work the liquid into the butter-flour mixture. Pressing the fork against the side of the bowl will help to incorporate the water. Keep adding water just until the dough is moistened and can be formed into a ball (this took about 11 tablespoons of water for me, but it will vary based on the moisture level of your butter as well as environmental factors). Divide the dough into two equal portions, form each portion into a ball, then flatten the balls somewhat into discs (note that if the dough is falling apart at this stage, you haven\u2019t added enough water). Wrap discs separately with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes or up to several days.When you are ready to bake your pie, preheat your oven to 375 degrees and prep the filling by combining the apple slices and lemon juice in a large bowl. In a separate, smaller bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, and cinnamon, then sprinkle the dry mixture over the apples and stir to incorporate. Set the mixture aside.Take the chilled dough discs out of the refrigerator, remove them from the plastic wrap, and set them on a lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll them into 2 12-inch circles. Gently transfer one of the pastry rounds to a 9-inch pie plate, being careful not to stretch the dough, then trim away any excess dough. Fill the pastry with the prepared apple filling, and top the pie with the other round of pastry. Seal the pie by lifting the bottom pastry edge away from the pie plate and folding excess top pastry under it. Crimp the edges of the pie if that suits your fancy, add any desired embellishments (I used a cookie cutter to cut the \"E\" from pie dough scraps), and use a sharp knife to cut a few slits in the dough to allow steam to escape during baking.Brush the top of the pie with milk and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Cover the edges of the pie with foil (or use a pie crust shield like this one) and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 15-20 minutes more until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbling around the slits in the top crust. Once baked, allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing.

Arrange the bacon slices side by side on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until browned and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain on paper towels.Meanwhile, make the pistachio cream: Combine the pistachios, red pepper flakes, garlic, lemon juice and spinach in a food processor and pulse until chopped; with the motor running, slowly stream in the olive oil until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and process 5 more seconds. Pour the mixture into a bowl and whisk in the crema; set aside.Assemble the quesadillas: On 1 half of each tortilla, layer 1/2 cup cheese, 3 slices bacon and a few date slices. Fold the tortillas in half to cover the filling. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 quesadillas and cook until golden on both sides and gooey in the middle, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining 2 quesadillas, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan.Cut each quesadilla into 4 triangles; serve with the pistachio cream.Photography by Johnny Miller

Lightly butter a 1 quart casserole dish or an 8x8-inch pan; set aside.In a large stock pot or dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package's instructions.

Pour the melted butter into the bowl with the bread, and toss until the bread is coated; set aside.In a large stock pot or dutch oven set over medium-low heat, add the remaining butter. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook, whisking continuously for 1 minute, taking care not to burn. While whisking, slowly pour in 2 cups of the warm milk, a little at a time so that the mixture stays nice and smooth. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick, about 8-10 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the salt, mustard, nutmeg, black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and 1 cups havarti,  cups gouda and 2 tablespoons pecorino romano.

First, pour the yogurt into a bowl. Then add the cream and vanilla. With a whisk, carefully stir until combined. It should be nice and thick.Sprinkle the brown sugar evenly over the top of the yogurt mixture. Do not stir the mixture. Cover the bowl with foil or plastic wrap and tightly seal the edges. Place in the refrigerator for at least 20 to 30 minutes.When you are ready to serve, place a small handful of berries (or other fruit) into a bowl or cup. Without stirring the mixture, spoon the yogurt over the berries. There will be creamy areas and brown sugar areas. Repeat the layers once, ending with berries on top.

filling: Heat the oil in a large saute pan set over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring to break up the turkey, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the turkey to a bowl and keep the fat in the pan. Add the chili powder, coriander, cumin, garlic, onions and bell peppers, and cook until soft and fragrant, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the meat back to the pan and stir to incorporate. Add the tomato puree, raisins, capers, olives, thyme and bay leaf, and cook until all of the flavors come together and the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season with the lime juice, salt and pepper. Cool the filling completely.For the dough: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup water, and work it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Lightly flour a rolling pin and a clean surface. Divide the dough in half. Refrigerate half of the dough and roll out the other half of the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough. Repeat with the remaining dough.In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork. Chill for at least 30 minutes.For the sauce: In a small mixing bowl, add the crema, cilantro and lime juice. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet.Place the empanadas on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with some egg wash. Using a fork, prick a few holes in the tops of the empanadas for the steam to escape. Bake until the empanadas are golden brown, 30 minutes.

For the Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in the bowl of a standing mixer; stir to dissolve. Add the sugar, eggs, milk, and vanilla; attach the paddle and mix at the lowest speed until well combined. Add 3 cups of the flour and the salt, mixing at low speed until the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium-low and add the butter pieces 1 at a time, beating until incorporated, about 20 seconds after each addition (total mixing time should be about 5 minutes). Replace the paddle with the dough hook and add the remaining 1 cup flour; knead at medium-low speed until soft and smooth, about 5 minutes longer. Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough tightens up slightly, about 2 minutes longer.2. Scrape the dough (which will be too soft to pick up with your hands) into a straight-sided lightly oiled plastic container or bowl using a plastic dough scraper. Cover the container tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at warm room temperature until doubled in size, 3 to 4 hours. Press down the dough, replace the plastic, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 4 or up to 24 hours. Alternatively, for a quick chill, spread the dough about 1 inch thick on a baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 2 hours.3. For the Filling: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer at high speed until smooth, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the lemon zest, egg, and vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium and continue beating, scraping down the sides of the bowl at least once, until incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl and chill thoroughly before using. (The filling can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 3 days.)4. For the Streusel: Mix the brown and granulated sugars, flour, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Add the butter and toss to coat. Pinch the butter chunks and dry mixture between your fingertips until the mixture is crumbly. Chill thoroughly before using. (The streusel can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 2 weeks.)5. For the Icing: Whisk all the ingredients in a medium bowl until smooth. (The icing can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 1 week. Thin with a few drops of milk before using.)6. When you are ready to shape the coffeecakes,remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, scraping the container sides with a rubber spatula if necessary. Divide the dough in half for 2 cakes.6a. Working with a half recipe of cold dough at a time, shape the dough into a log about 8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Using your outstretched hands, roll the log evenly into a 40-inch rope about 1 inch in diameter.6b. With your fingers together, gently press the log to flatten slightly into a 1-inch-wide strip.6c. Using both hands, twist the rope.6d. Loosely coil the rope in a spiral pattern, leaving a -inch space between coils. Tuck the end under and pinch to secure. Place the coil on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with second half of dough.7. Proof until slightly puffed (they will not increase in volume as dramatically as a leaner bread dough), 1 to 2 hours. (After this final rise, the unbaked cakes can be refrigerated overnight and baked the next morning.)8. For the Egg Wash: Beat the egg and cream in a small bowl until combined.9. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Working with and baking one coffeecake at a time, brush with egg wash evenly over the exposed dough. Place half of the filling over the center of the top, leaving a 1-inch border around the perimeter. Sprinkle the top evenly with half of the streusel. Slide the baking sheet onto a second baking sheet to prevent the bottom crust from overbrowning and bake until deep golden brown and/or an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the cake reads 190 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes. Slide the parchment with the coffeecake onto a wire rack and cool at least 20 minutes. Drizzle the cake with half the icing and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/rich-coffeecake-with-sweet-cheese-filling-507853", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 20, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/nacho-crescent-pinwheels-172155.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 172155, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Nacho Crescent Pinwheels", "preparationMinutes": 15, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 can (8 oz) Pillsbury\u2122 refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or 1 can (8 oz) Pillsbury\u2122 refrigerated Crescent Dough Sheet", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "refrigerated crescent dinner rolls", "metaInformation": ["canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crescent-rolls.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 93618, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 package (3 oz) cream cheese, softened", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoons Old El Paso\u2122 taco seasoning mix (from 1-oz package)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "taco seasoning mix", "metaInformation": ["(from 1-oz package)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2073, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "finely"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1001009, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup whole kernel corn with red and green peppers (from 11-oz can), drained", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "corn kernel", "metaInformation": ["whole", "green", "red", "with  and  peppers (from 11-oz can), drained "], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11172, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons finely chopped green onions (2 medium)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green onions", "metaInformation": ["green", "(2 medium)", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11291, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "Old El Paso\u2122 Thick 'n Chunky salsa, if desired", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "salsa", "metaInformation": ["thick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salsa.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6164, "unit": "serving"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.BettyCrocker.com/recipes/nacho-crescent-pinwheels/6340a2c6-f9bb-4bfb-a2dc-43a2f7a3f62e", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 56, "instructions": "1                               Heat oven to 350F.

If you don't have a panini press, preheat a cast iron skillet in the oven as well.2) Roughly chop chicken. Grate cheese, slice the apple thin and squeeze lemon juice over the apples.3) Take four large slices of thick sourdough bread and lightly butter one side of each piece. Divide the chicken and cheese between two pieces of bread with buttered side down.4) Top cheese with apple slices and slather the extra pieces of bread with raspberry jam on the non-buttered side. Top the sandwiches so the jam and apples are together.5) Place sandwiches in panini press or place them on a baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil. Place the hot cast iron skillet on top of the foil and place back in the oven.6) If you're using the panini press, cook sandwich according to press instructions. If you're pressing in the oven using my crazy cast iron skillet method, you'll need to cook them for about 15 minutes.Remove sandwiches and slice each sandwich into three even sections.

them from charring.Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, thai red curry paste, curry powder, cayenne, garlic, ginger, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Add the chicken and toss well, making sure the curry mixture completely coats the chicken. Let this sit while you prep the zucchini.Brush the slices of zucchini with the remaining olive oil on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Preheat the grill to medium high.While the grill preheats make the mango fried rice, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss in the cashews and dry toast them for about 5 minutes, flipping occasionally. They should be slightly browned in some spots, but its okay if theyre unevenly browned, you dont have to be too precise about it. Transfer cashews to a large plate.Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the red pepper. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the red pepper is seared. Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes, and toss for 30 seconds or so, being careful not to burn. Remove the veggies from the pan and place on the plate with the cashews.Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the eggs and season with salt and pepper. Stir the eggs constantly and cook until almost set but still moist, then transfer egg to a bowl. Break the eggs up with a wooden spoon or spatula.Add 1 more tablespoon of oil to the pan and about half of the rice. Toss to coat, then add in the remaining rice, tossing once again. Cook for about 3 minutes, tossing often, until warmed through.Add the soy sauce, hot sauce and red curry paste, and toss. Cook for another 3 minutes, until the rice has browned sufficiently. Add the veggies back in and the cashews and mango. Cook just until mangos are heated through. Keep warm on the stove while you grill the chicken and zucchini.When ready to grill, place the chicken onto the skewers (or if you do not have skewers you can place the chicken in foil or cook on the stove).Grill the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, gently flipping 2-3 times until chicken is cooked through and has light char marks. While the chicken is grilling grill the zucchini for about 4 minutes on each side, or until tender. You may also use a grill pan to do this.Once done remove everything from grill. Then spread the softened goat cheese all the way down one side of the zucchini.

Starting at the center, press the dough into the pan with the back of a measuring cup. Use your fingers to work your way outward and up the sides. If the dough begins sticking to your hands, lightly wet your hands and shake off excess water. Bake in the oven for 8 minutes then set aside to cool.Prepare the filling:In a blender, combine the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, coconut sugar, almond milk, arrowroot, pumpkin pie spice, salt and molasses. Blend for about 20 seconds, or until smooth.Pour the filling into the pie crust, until full. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes. The filling should feel firm but still slightly jiggly. Allow to cool on the counter for 2-3 hours then cover and store in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, ideally overnight. Slice the pie into pieces then top with coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Since you'll have to work pretty quickly once they've baked, do three per sheet.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Bake for 5 minutes or until the cookies have turned golden at the edges. The center will remain paler. You can prepare your second sheet while the first is baking.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Remove from oven and quickly move the first cookie with a wide metal spatula and place upside down on a wooden board. Quickly place the fortune close to the middle of the cookie and fold the cookie in half so it becomes a half-moon. Bring corners together gently (you can do this over the rim of a cup) to form the signature fortune cookie shape.                                                                                                                             7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place folded cookies into the cups of a muffin tin (or silicone baking cups) to hold their shape until firm. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.
