Evenly drape the wonton wrappers over the pan's walls on a diagonal, making triangle-shaped \"shells.\" (Use two pans, if needed, to keep the wontons from overlapping.) Bake them until just crispy enough to hold their shape, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, but leave the oven on. Carefully remove the shells and gently open them to form \"tacos.\" Set aside.In a microwave-safe bowl, combine coleslaw mix, cilantro, and dressing. Mix well. Cover and microwave for about 1 minute, until slightly softened. Set aside.In another bowl, combine chicken with BBQ sauce; mix well and set aside.Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Evenly distribute the BBQ chicken among the shells, followed by the slaw, about 1 tablespoon of each per shell. Lay the filled wontons gently on their sides on the baking sheet.Spray the shells lightly with nonstick spray. Bake for about 5 minutes, until warm and crunchy.

Butter and line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In another large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in the vanilla. In three additions, beat in the flour mixture, alternating with additions of the buttermilk, starting and ending with flour. Fold in the chocolate. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool completely, and then remove the cake from the pan using the parchment overhangs to lift it out.For the frosting: In a large bowl, whisk together the malt powder, cocoa powder and boiling water until smooth. Let cool.Add the butter and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy. Add the chocolate and salt and beat until smooth and thick. Spread the frosting onto the cooled cake.

"instructions": "1. Make the Crust: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spread the 5 tablespoons of coconut in a small baking pan and toast in the oven until golden brown, about 9 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. When cool enough to handle, reserve 1 tablespoon for garnishing the finished pie.2. Pulse the graham crackers and the remaining 4 tablespoons toasted coconut in a food processor until the crackers are broken down into coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses. Process the mixture to evenly fine crumbs, about 12 seconds more. Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl and stir in the sugar to combine; add the melted butter and toss with a fork until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Empty the crumb mixture into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Press the crumbs evenly into the bottom and up the sides, forming a crust. Bake the crust until deep golden brown and fragrant, about 22 minutes. Cool the crust on a wire rack while making the filling.3. Make the Filling: Bring the coconut milk, whole milk, shredded coconut, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar. When the mixture reaches a simmer, whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl to break them up, then whisk in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and cornstarch until well combined and no lumps remain. Gradually whisk the simmering liquid into the yolk mixture to temper it, then return the mixture to the saucepan, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly, until 3 or 4 bubbles burst on the surface and the mixture is thickened, about 30 seconds. Off the heat, whisk in the vanilla and butter. Pour the filling into the cooled crust, press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling and refrigerate until the filling is cold and firm, at least 3 hours.4. Make the Whipped Cream Topping: When ready to serve, beat the cream and sugar in the chilled bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed to soft peaks; add the rum and vanilla. Continue to beat to barely stiff peaks. Spread or pipe the whipped  cream over the chilled filling. Sprinkle the reserved 1 tablespoon toasted coconut over the whipped cream and serve. Cover any leftovers with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/coconut-cream-pie-507481", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly, and cook until the strawberries are very soft, a good 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to completely smush them to smithereens. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a bowl. Use a spoon to stir the fruit so the liquid is forced through. Continue until almost all of the liquid is in the bowl. Set the pulp aside.Skim as much foam off the sauce as you can. Pour the skimmed sauce back into the same saucepan, add 1/4 cup of the pulp back in and boil again for 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Skim off any more foam that has formed on the surface, then allow the sauce to cool slightly before pouring it into a pitcher or jar. Refrigerate it to thicken and serve it cold.

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). 2. Pat the beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Brown the beef on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes, reducing the heat if the beef begins to scorch. Transfer the beef to a large plate. Pour off all the fat in the pot, add the pancetta, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, 1 teaspoon of the thyme, and the rosemary and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour, tomato paste, and sugar and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the wine, scraping up any browned bits, until smooth. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer.3. Add the beef, along with any juices that accumulated on the plate, to the pot and bring to a simmer. Cover, place the pot in the oven, and cook until the meat is very tender and a fork inserted in it meets very little resistance, 3 to 3 1/2 hours, turning the beef every hour.4. Transfer the beef to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Meanwhile, strain the braising liquid into a fat separator or bowl, discarding the solids. Defat the braising liquid by pouring off the fat, skimming the fat with a ladle, or refrigerating the whole shebang overnight so that the solidified fat can be lifted from the surface.5. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon thyme to the defatted braising liquid, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until thickened, saucy, and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.6. Remove the kitchen string, slice the beef against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices, and transfer to a serving platter.

Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 10 minutes more.

Drain and set aside to cool for a few minutes.Use a fork to lightly mash the potatoes  they should not be completely smooth, but you dont want huge lumps left either. Add the leeks and garlic, butter, parsley, curry powder, egg, milk, and half of the cheese. Mix well. Transfer the mixture to the pre-baked pie crust, and spread out into an even layer.

toothpick in the center comes out with just a few crumbs.  Remove the cupcakes from the pan immediately, and place on a wire rack to cool (be careful, they will be hot).  Allow to cool completely before frosting.*For regular sized cupcakes, bake at 350\u00baF for 15-17 minutes.Melt the chocolate in a heat proof bowl in the microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring in between. Set aside to cool.  If you want vanilla buttercream, skip this step.Bring a saucepan filled with 2 inches of water to a simmer. Place the egg whites and sugar into a heat proof mixer bowl, and place above the water. Whisk the sugar and egg whites until warm to the touch and the sugar is dissolved.Place the bowl back on the mixer stand, and whisk on medium-high speed until you have stiff, glossy peaks, and the mixture is cool, about 10 minutes.Reduce speed to medium-low, and add the butter, one piece at a time, mixing until fully incorporated between each piece. If it appears curdled at this point, keep mixing until it becomes smooth again.

Bobby's right. A really good veggie burger is not an easy thing! It takes the perfect texture, combo of spices and flavors, something to make it stick together - for vegans, no eggs allowed - and to me, a veggie burger still has to be healthy. Deep frying a bean patty might be yummy, but it's missing the point.A good veggie burger is a powerful thing. Am I sounding dramatic? But it's true! A good veggie burger can make anyone - even real-hamburger addicts - say \"Wow, I really could crave this veggie burger once in a while!\" - or maybe, just maybe one good veggie burger, and you might crave a veggie burger all the time..First, let us gawk at the beauty of a Veggie. Burger. shall we?..Fiesta Slaw - zippy burger topping..burgers for two?..I'm not saying I'm a veggie burger expert. I still have a long way to go in crafting \"the perfect burger\" - or maybe Bobby will do it first for me. But I'm certainly proud of the recipes I have created thus far. And today's black bean burger gets a thumbs up from my taste buds.My other veggie burgers: my white bean burger, my green edamame burger and even my sweet potato burger. And my latest burger is black bean - in honor of Bobby's preference for southwestern flair. I even took Bobby's advice and included some crunchy jicama in my burger-topping slaw.Don't forget the avocado!! I did. As you can tell from the photos. I had some lime-juice spritzed, sliced avocado all ready to go for the burgers, but I forgot it! I later added it for a taste test and I definitely recommend it.Black Bean Fiesta Burgersvegan, makes 5 burgers5 whole wheat burger bunsCilantro Jicama Fiesta Slaw (recipe here)Burgers:1 1/2 cups black beans, drained/canned (unsalted)3 Tbsp fine bread crumbs3/4 cup baked/mashed sweet potato3 Tbsp chopped cilantro - including stems1/3 cup diced white onion1 tsp garlic powder1 tsp chopped garlic3/4 tsp salt1 tsp black pepper2 Tbsp olive oil1 Tbsp cider vinegar2 Tbsp lime juice1/2 jalapeno, diced/de-seeded3 Tbsp nutritional yeast - or use more bread crumbsa few dashes of chipotle powder or cayenne for extra heatSpecial Spicy Sauce:1/2 cup vegan mayo2 tsp garlic hot sauce5 round onion slices and 5 round tomato slicesoptional: lime-juice spritzed avocado slices (not shown in burger photos - but recommended!)Directions:1. First off prepare the Fiesta Slaw according to the directions. (recipe) - Chill in fridge until ready to add to burgers.2. Whip up your \"special spicy sauce\" - set aside in fridge as well.3. Next up, prepare the burgers. Pulse all the ingredients in a food processor. You can also mash well by hand - but a fp is a tad faster. Next, hand-form burger patties with the mixture and place them on a lightly greased baking sheet. I like to roll my burgers in a touch of bread crumbs so that they have nice crisp edges.baked burgers..4. Bake your burgers at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before assembling burgers.

Put the butter, 2 glugs of olive oil, the sage, and garlic into a heavy-bottomed, non-stick pan. Stir everything round and add the onions, shallots, and leeks. Season with salt and pepper. Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly over medium-low heat for 50 minutes without coloring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes; your onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavor, so don\u2019t be tempted to speed this bit up.2. When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavor.3. Preheat the oven or broiler to maximum. Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it\u2019s perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking sheet. Tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Sprinkle with some grated Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce.4. Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven or under the broiler to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn\u2019t burn! When the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the baking sheet and carry it to the table.

Drain, reserving juice; set cherries aside. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup bread flour, whole wheat flour, yeast and salt. In a small saucepan, combine the milk, syrup, butter and reserved cherry liquid; heat to 120\u00b0-130\u00b0. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened.                                                                                            Add egg; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining bread flour to form a soft dough (dough will be slightly sticky). Beat for 2 minutes. Stir in walnuts and cherries. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
