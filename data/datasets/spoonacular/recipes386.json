Add the melted coconut oil and egg and mix until the mixture forms a ball. (Note: I don't have a food processor, so I mixed all the ingredients for the crust in a large bowl with a silicon spatula and it turned out perfectly). Press the crust into a pie plate, up and around the edges as well.Bake the almond flour crust for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges look golden brown. Pull the crust out of the oven and set aside to cool.Heat the chocolate in the microwave on medium power (about 60-120 seconds) or over the stovetop on medium-low until melted. Whisk in the vanilla extract and set chocolate aside to cool.Scoop the coconut cream out of the can of coconut milk. Place it in a medium bowl and beat the coconut cream with a hand mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. Cover and refrigerate the cream.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the coconut sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Pour in the cooled chocolate and beat until well incorporated. Add 2 of the 3 eggs and beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the remaining egg and beat for another 3 minutes or until the mixture is smooth.Fold in the chilled coconut cream into the chocolate filling until there are no visible white streaks left. Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust and smooth the top over with a spatula.Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 or 3 hours, but preferably overnight.Decorate the pie with the fresh raspberries and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/paleo-raspberry-french-silk-pie-779556", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Classic-Buttermilk-Pancakes-618002.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 618002, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Classic Buttermilk Pancakes", "pricePerServing": 71.29, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2-1/2 tsp. baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp. baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "3 Tbs. unsalted butter; more for serving", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbs", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "2 cups buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1230, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp. kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1082047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "Pure maple syrup for serving", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": ["pure", "for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 17.0, "id": 19911, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "9 oz.

Grease a 13 by 17-inch sheet pan and line the bottom and sides with parchment or waxed paper.  Sift together the 3 cups of sugar, the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use a hand mixer) and blend briefly. Whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Add to the dry ingredients and mix at low speed for 5 minutes. Gradually add the hot water, mixing at low speed just until combined. The batter will be quite thin.Pour the batter into the pan. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay) and the center feels firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan.
