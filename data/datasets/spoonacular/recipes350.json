cup of vegetable oil, divided1 to 2 packages of thin po'boy bread (like Leidenheimer)Butter for the breadTo Dress Poboys:MayonnaiseAmerican cheese or Velveeta cheese, sliced thinShredded lettuceSliced tomatoesPickle slices or spearsInstructionsMelt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onion, bell pepper and celery; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the green onion and garlic; cook another minute. Stir in the salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, Old Bay, parsley, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.Toast the bread slices, remove crust and reserve for another use. Sprinkle each piece of toast with water to dampen and set aside in a bowl. Let rest for 2 minutes. Pick through the crabmeat to check for any stray shell; set aside. Squeeze all of the water out of the bread and add the bread, crab and lemon juice to the vegetable mixture; gently mix, taste and adjust seasonings. Add the beaten egg.Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper and set aside. Place flour in a pie plate. Use an ice cream scoop to measure out the crab mixture, then shape into thin, oval patties. Dredge patties in flour, lightly coating on both sides. Set tray in refrigerator for 30 minutes or longer, until needed. Can also freeze at this point.Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet and cook crabmeat patties until browned and crisped on both sides, adding additional oil as needed. Split French bread lengthwise and cut to desired size. Butter cut sides and place into a separate griddle pan or large skillet over medium high heat until cut sides are toasted. Add mayonnaise to the bottom half of the bread. Top with cheese, crabmeat patties, and top half of the bread; place back into the skillet, using a spatula to press down on the po'boy as it toasts. Flip and turn, pressing, until outsides are nicely toasted and cheese is melted. Remove, open and dress with sliced tomato, shredded lettuce and sliced pickles, or with a pickle spear on the side. Serve immediately.Cook's Notes: Great when served with a cup of seafood gumbo and fresh, hot french fries. You can use any good French bread, though I prefer Leidenheimer brand poboy bread for these, which is a thinner and longer Louisiana-made French bread, intended especially for po'boys. It is packaged with two thin loaves per bag; each loaf can serve up to 4, depending on the size poboy you prefer. Reisings is also a good brand.Minis: These make perfect minis for a party. Shape patties to fit small pistolette French rolls.To Freeze: Form the patties, dredge in flour and line them up on a parchment covered baking sheet, freezing until solid. Transfer to a zipper freezer bag and use within 3 months for best flavor.

Divide dough into two equal balls (each should weigh about 12 ounces); wrap tightly in two layers of plastic wrap, flatten into disks, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Note: if standard pie crust gives you trouble, try pulsing 2/3 of the flour with the butter until it comes together into a paste (you'll feel like you are overprocessing, but that's ok!) Break up the paste and spread it evenly around the food processor, then sprinkle with remaining flour and give it 5-6 short pulses.

Gradually add 2 1/2 cups of flour and turn speed up to medium.If dough is still very sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more flour so that the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.Continue to knead with the dough hook for a few minutes. The dough will form a ball around the hook. If you do not have a dough hook attachment, knead by hand on your floured work surface for a few minutes.Remove the dough from the hook and roll it out to 1/2 inch thick on a well floured surface. Using a biscuit cutter or the rim of a 3 inch glass, cut out six circles in the dough.Roll out each circle to about 8 inches in diameter, dusting with flour as needed so you dough won't stick to the rolling pin or work surface.Divide the prepared sausage filling onto one half of each of the circles of dough. Top the sausage filling with mozzarella cheese. Fold the empty half of the dough over the filling, pinching the edges closed. I like to use the tines of a fork, or the rim of a spoon to create a \"scalloped\" edge.Transfer them from your work surface to a Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheet.Cover the uncooked calzones with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise while the oven preheats to 400 degrees.When the oven is ready, brush each calzone with the egg wash and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.Bake for 12-14 minutes. The top of the calzones should be golden brown.Serve with warmed marinara.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-calzones-with-italian-sausage-and-mozzarella-584746",
