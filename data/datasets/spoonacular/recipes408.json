Simmer, stirring constantly, for a minute or so until the sauce thickens a bit. Stir in the cilantro. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed. Serve the curry over hot, cooked rice, quinoa or whatever else you might like (or it can be served on its own).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chicken-curry-in-a-hurry-606361", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Copy Kat", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Toscana-Pagila-e-Fieno-600445.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 600445, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Toscana Pagila e Fieno", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 181.12, "creditText": "Copy Kat", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons Butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 well-beaten Egg Yolks", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolks", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup Cook Ham cut into Julianne strips", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "ham", "metaInformation": ["cut into julianne strips"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ham-whole.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10151, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 ounces White Noodles", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "noodles", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20420, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup frozen Peas", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peas", "metaInformation": ["frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11304, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup Whipping Cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whipping cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001053, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 57.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.copykat.com/2009/02/03/toscana-pagila-e-fieno/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 36, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}], "step": "Cook noodles in boiling salted water until they are done.

your own fresh breadcrumbs, trim crusts from whole-wheat bread. Tear bread into pieces and process in a food processor until coarse crumbs form. To make fine breadcrumbs, process until very fine. To make dry breadcrumbs, spread coarse or fine breadcrumbs on a baking sheet and bake at 250F until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. One slice of bread makes about 1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs or about 1/3 cup dry breadcrumbs. For store-bought coarse dry breadcrumbs we like Ians brand, labeled Panko breadcrumbs. Find them at well-stocked supermarkets.NutritionPer serving: 302 calories; 22 g fat (3 g sat, 12 g mono);33 mg cholesterol; 8 g carbohydrates; 0 g added sugars; 18 g protein; 1 g fiber; 469 mg sodium;

Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 1 week.Photograph by Charles Masters                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine
