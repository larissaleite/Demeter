Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon and cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 248 degrees (firm ball) on a candy thermometer. Very carefully (it\u2019s hot!) pour the caramel into the prepared pan and refrigerate for a few hours, until firm.When the caramels are cold, pry the sheet from the pan onto a cutting board. Cut the sheet in half. Starting with a long side, roll one piece of the caramel up tightly into an 8-inch-long log. Repeat with the second piece. Sprinkle both logs with fleur de sel, trim the ends, and cut each log in 8 pieces. Cut glassine or parchment papers into 4 x 5-inch pieces and wrap each caramel individually, twisting the ends. Store in the refrigerator and serve the caramels chilled.Butter a 9 x 13 pan really well.Melt butter on medium to low heat in large soup pot.Once butter is melted, add in marshmallows and melt down marshmallows completely.Add in rice krispie cereal and mix together melted marshmallow completely.Pour in buttered pan, and press down with buttered spatula.Let cool.Once caramel is cooked, pour directly over cooled rice krispie treats.Place in refrigerator and let cool for two hours.Enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-salted-caramel-rice-krispie-treats-515202",
