Cut the garlic cloves in half then rub one of the cut sides all over the inside of a 9 x 13 inch baking dish (or similar sized casserole dish), then mince the cloves.In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, apples, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.Place a layer of potatoes at the bottom of the pan, followed by a thin layer of the apples. Repeat, rotating the potatoes and apples, until the pan is full.Slowly pour the cream over the mixture until it covers the potatoes if you\u2019re pressing them down with a spoon. If you\u2019re like me, and you filled the dish a leeeetle too full, I recommend placing it on a baking sheet before slipping it into the oven.Bake the potatoes for 20 minutes then remove, and use the back of a spoon to gently crack the surface, allowing the cream to re-moisten any potatoes that are sticking out the top. Return to the oven, and continue to bake for another 20 minutes, then crack the crust again. Place the potatoes back in the oven a final time, bake for 2 minutes, then remove from the oven. Don\u2019t crack the crust this time! Most of the cream should be absorbed and the crust should be starting to brown.If you\u2019re making this dish ahead of time, allow the potatoes to cool, cover, and refrigerate over night. Otherwise, sprinkle the cheese and prosciutto on top of the crust, and return to the oven for another 30 minutes or until the dish is bubbling and the cheese is nice and browned.If you made the dish ahead of time, simply remove it from the fridge and uncover while you\u2019re preheating the oven, then cover in cheese and bake for 30-40 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted and

"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.Take the seeds out of the tomatoes, coarsely chop the tomatoes and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Toss the tomatoes with the olive oil, brown sugar and season with salt and pepper. Spread the tomatoes out evenly on the baking sheet and roast the tomatoes for about 40 minutes, just until most of the liquid cooks off and the tomatoes are slightly charred in some areas.Meanwhile, place the lobster in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Supposedly, this sedates the lobster.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt. Cut off the rubber bands off the lobster claws. Add the lobster to the boiling water making sure it's completely submerged. Cook the lobster for about 10 minutes. The lobster will turn pink when it's done cooking. Take the lobster out of the water, but set the water aside. We will use some of it to make the flavorful lobster stock.When the lobster is cool enough to handle, take the lobster meat out of the shell. There will be some meat in the claws and most of it will be in the tail. Chop the lobster meat into bite sized pieces.Save the claw shells and the tail shell and place them in the stock pot with 8 cups of the water that we used to cook the lobster in. Add the white wine, bay leaves, black peppercorns and parsley. Season with salt. Cook the stock for about 30 minutes.In another pot, melt the butter and add the shallots, carrots, celery and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 7 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.Add the flour and mix it in until it's completely incorporated. Cook it for about a minute, just to cook off the raw flour taste.Add the roasted tomatoes, mix to combine and slowly add in the strained lobster stock, about a cup at a time, mixing it well, to get all the lumps out.Add as much of the lobster stock as you like, depending on the consistency that you like your bisque to be. I used almost all of the stock, with about 2-3 cups left over.Bring the bisque to a boil and continue to cook for about 10-15 minutes.Puree the soup in batches in a blender. Return to the soup pot. Add the cream and mix to combine. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.Meanwhile, melt about  a Tablespoon of butter in a skillet, add the chopped lobster, season with salt and pepper and cook for just a minute or two. This step is completely optional. I like the buttery taste, the additional salt and the slightly browned lobster. You can add the chopped, cooked lobster to the soup without sauteing it.Garnish the soup with the lobster, fresh herbs and Parmesan Herb Croutons.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lobster-bisque-485189", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 105, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lottie and Doof", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/ginger_scallion_sauce-39809.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 39809, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Ginger Scallion Sauce", "creditText": "Lottie and Doof", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 ozs of ginger, peeled and cut into chunks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "cut into chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "ozs"}, {"originalString": "1 cup of peanut oil (or other neutral vegetable oil that handles heat well)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "peanut oil", "metaInformation": ["neutral", "well", "(or other vegetable oil that handles heat )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4042, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 bunches of scallions (about 6 ozs) rinsed, dried and cut into 1-inch pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["dried", "rinsed", "cut into 1-inch pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 11291, "unit": "ozs"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 100.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2012/02/ginger-scallion-sauce/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "aggregateLikes": 61, "instructions": null, "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/ginger-scallion-sauce-39809", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Salad in a Jar", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Waynes-Fresh-Veggies-in-a-Blanket-622861.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 622861, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Wayne\u2019s Fresh Veggies in a Blanket", "creditText": "Salad in a Jar", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 carrots, grated", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup low-fat hummus", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "hummus", "metaInformation": ["low-fat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hummus.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16158, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "8 lettuce leaves or 1 cup spinach leaves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce leaves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 93623, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 red or orange bell pepper-cut into strips", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "orange bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bell-pepper-orange.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011821, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Mild Salsa", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "salsa", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salsa.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 6164, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "8 whole wheat tortillas (My favorite are La Tortilla Factory Original Whole Wheat--the small size with 50 calories a piece and 7 g of fiber)", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "whole wheat tortillas", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat", "whole", "with 50 calories a piece and 7 g of fiber)", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tortillas-whole-wheat.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 93675, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 91.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.salad-in-a-jar.com/skinny-secrets/waynes-fresh-veggies-in-a-blanket", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 386, "instructions": "Spread hummus thinly on the tortilla.Layer spinach or lettuce, then carrots, followed by salsa.

Place roast in a 13 x 9 pan and rub entire roast with dry rub mixture, pressing mixture into the roast.  Cover roast with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.  In a medium mixing bowl combine apple juice, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, liquid smoke and garlic powder.  Place roast in a slow cooker, pour several tablespoons of the apple juice mixture over the top of the roast, then pour remaining mixture on the side of the roast (I do  this so all the dry rub isn't washed off the top).  Cover slow cooker with lid and cook on low heat 8 - 10 hours.  Remove roast from slow cooker and shred.  Return shredded pork to slow cooker (in broth) and allow to cook 30 more minutes.  Ladle out majority of the broth (I leave about 1/2 - 3/4 cup) and pour in barbecue sauce and stir.  Serve warm, over rolls with optional coleslaw.*Original recipe calls for 2 Tbsp of each salt and pepper but I thought 1 1/2 Tbsp was plenty.

cream, and milk just to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and steep, covered, 30 minutes.                                                                Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F.                                                                Pour steeped cream through a very fine sieve into a bowl, pressing lightly on cheese solids and discarding them. Whisk together whole egg, yolks, salt, and white pepper in another bowl, then add steeped cream in a stream, whisking until smooth.

Set ramekins in a baking pan and bake in a hot water bath in middle of oven until centers of custards are completely set, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer ramekins to a rack and cool 5 minutes (do not allow to cool longer, or custards will stick to ramekins).                                                            Make soup while cream steeps and custards bake:                Wash chopped leek in a bowl of cold water, then lift out and drain well. Cook leek, shallot, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in butter in a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately low heat, stirring, until leek is softened, about 3 minutes. Add asparagus, broth, and water and simmer, covered, until asparagus is just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. After 2 to 4 minutes, remove 6 asparagus tips, halve lengthwise and reserve for garnish.                                                                Pur\u00e9e soup in batches in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Transfer to a large bowl, then pour through a sieve into cleaned pot. Stir in cream, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and heat over moderately low heat until hot.                                                            Serve soup with custards:                Working with 1 custard at a time, run a thin knife around edge of each to loosen it, then invert a soup bowl over ramekin and invert custard into bowl. Repeat with remaining custards. Ladle soup around custards and garnish with reserved asparagus tips and parmesan curls.
