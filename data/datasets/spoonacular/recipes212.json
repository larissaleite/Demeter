Butter three 8-inch (or 9-inch) round cake pans, line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper, then butter the parchment. Lightly dust the cake pans with flour, shaking out excess.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, on medium-high speed, beat together butter and sugars. Beat until light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla, and continue beating the mixture for another 5 minutes.Reduce mixer speed to low, then add flour mixture alternating with yogurt, in three batches, beginning and ending with flour. Mix just until smooth. Divide the batter equally among the three cake pans, rap the pans once or twice on the counter to get rid of any air bubbles.Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each layer comes out clean, about 20-25 minutes for 9-inch cake pans or 25-30 minutes for 8-inch pans, rotating cake layers about halfway through baking time. Cool layers in pans for about 10 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edge of each and invert layers onto cooling racks to cool completely.(Note: Layers can be made in advance. Bake up to 1 week ahead, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, store individual layers in a plastic freezer bag, and freeze. Thaw layers overnight in refrigerator the night before you plan to assemble the cake.)Prepare FrostingMake caramel mixture: In a small saucepan, over medium-high heat, bring sugar and water to a boil. Continue cooking, without stirring, until the mixture turns  amber in color, about 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and slowly add cream and vanilla, stirring well until completely blended. Set aside until cool.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, on medium-high speed, beat butter until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low and add salt, then slowly add confectioners' sugar. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.
