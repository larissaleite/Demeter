|Cook time: 25 min |Yield: About 4 to 6 servingsIngredientsFor the Shrimp Sauce:1 tablespoon of butter1/2 cup of onion1 tablespoon of minced garlic2 cups of peeled and chopped tomatoes, juices retained1 teaspoon of kosher salt, or to taste1/4 teaspoon of freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning, or to taste1/4 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning (like Slap Ya Mama), or to taste1 teaspoon of granulated sugar1 tablespoon of fresh, chopped parsley1 tablespoon of fresh, chopped basil1 pound of small shrimp, peeled and deveined1/2 cup of heavy creamFor the Fried Green Tomatoes:3 medium sized green tomatoesKosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper1/4 cup of milk or buttermilk1 large egg1 cup of self rising flour1/4 cup of cornmeal1/4 cup of cracker crumbs1/4 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning (like Slap Ya Mama), or to tasteVegetable or canola oil, for fryingInstructionsFor the sauce, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook just until translucent, then add the garlic and cook another minute. Add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, pepper, Old Bay, Cajun seasoning, sugar, parsley and basil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 25 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Stir in the shrimp and cook until shrimp turns pink; stir in the cream and heat through. Hold over low while you prepare the fried green tomatoes.Meanwhile, for the fried green tomatoes, slice tomatoes 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, set on paper towels and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Let rest for 5 minutes. Beat together the milk and egg in a small bowl; set aside. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, cracker crumbs and Cajun seasoning. Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a skillet. Dip the tomato slices in the milk, then into the flour mixture, shake off excess and place into the hot oil. Cook until both sides are lightly browned and drain on paper towels. Place two to three green tomato slices on a serving plate per person and spoon some of the shrimp sauce over the tomatoes.Cook's Notes: May substitute 2 (15 ounce) cans of stewed tomatoes, chopped, but undrained. Use your kitchen shears to cut them up right in the can. Dried herbs may also be substituted for the fresh parsley and basil, but reduce to 1 teaspoon. Also okay to use already cooked shrimp, simply add to warm through at the end, but take into consideration any seasonings.This sauce is also great for pasta. Before adding cream, add in 3/4 cup of the pasta water or chicken stock, heat to boiling, reduce, stir in the cream and warm through. Toss sauce with your choice of cooked pasta. May also substitute fresh crab, or cooked crumbled Italian sausage for the seafood, or serve without any protein, if desired.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download

Then, add in the stevia and flour a little at a time, whisking after each addition.Once the cheesecake filling is whisked until smooth, set asideNext, start the base. Mist or lightly oil an 8x8 pan.In a bowl, mix together the cookie crumbs, flax, whey protein and liquid stevia (if using).Once dry ingredients combined, drizzle in the melted butter and stir until its all combined.Press the graham crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of the 8x8 square pan. Ensure you pack it down firmly.Then pour over the cheesecake filling and spread it around so its even.Place in the oven and bake for approx. 45-50 minutesWhen its done, it will just start to go golden around the edges, start pulling away from the pan, and won't jiggle when wiggled slightly.If it still seems too liquidy in the middle, bake for a few minutes longer.Allow to cool completely.If drizzling with white chocolate (optional), melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the stove, then drizzle over the entire cheesecake with a fork or spoon.Then put into the fridge and allow to chill completely. It will take 2+ hours to completely chill in the fridge.Keep stored in the fridge with tin foil over top of the pan, or cut into bars, and transfer to a container.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-protein-bars-615873", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Food Fanatic", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/soft-peanut-butter-cup-cookies-719430.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 9, "id": 719430, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Soft Peanut Butter Cup Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 45, "pricePerServing": 23.99, "creditText": "Food Fanatic", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 ounces white chocolate almond bark", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond bark", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/baking-chocolate.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 98857, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup creamy peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "creamy peanut butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10116098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.75, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 cups light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 19334, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "8 peanut butter cups, diced into small cubes", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "peanut butter cups", "metaInformation": ["diced", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter-cup.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 19150, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 stick salted butter, slightly softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "salted butter", "metaInformation": ["salted", "softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter.jpg", "unitLong": "stick", "unitShort": "stick", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001001, "unit": "stick"}, {"originalString": "3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 3.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 6.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodfanatic.com/2016/03/soft-peanut-butter-cup-cookies/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg", "id": 404770, "name": "baking paper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 350F.
