Lightly grease an 8-inch round cake pan and dust it with cocoa powder.  Update:  I baked this cake before I knew about the parchment paper trick.  Since I knew that I haven\u2019t baked a cake without it.  Take a sheet of parchment paper, place the pan you want to use on the paper and trace the shape with a pencil.  Cut it out.  Spray the cake tin with non stick spray, place the parchment cut out and spray it lightly once again.Grate the bottlegourd/zucchini, if using.  After grating I also coarsely chopped it with a knife.  Measure 1 cup and transfer it to a bowl.  Let the water secrete from the gratings.  If using the water you may omit the 1/4 cup of milk later.In a large bowl sift together the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa powder and sugar.  Make a well.Add all the wet ingredients one by one.With an electric mixer, beat the mixture on low speed for 2-3 minutes until the dry and wet ingredients are well combined.  Do not over beat it.Add the grated bottle gourd/zucchini, if using.  Mix together.Pour the batter in the prepared pan.  Tap the pan a couple of times so the batter is spread evenly and there are no air bubbles.My cake was ready only around 38 minutes.  I think it took longer because it was a dense batter with the whole wheat flour, applesauce and the bottle gourd.  So start checking from about 20 minutes, depending upon the ingredients you are using.  Toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake should come clean.Once out of the oven, transfer the pan to a wiring rack to cool.  After about an hour remove the cake from the pan and let the cake cool completely before frosting.  Update: If you follow the parchment trick, the cake will come out clean just after 15 minutes.

Turn the heat down to medium and continuously stir caramel until it is completely melted again, about 5 minutes. Stir in butter, vanilla, and salt, and mix until butter has melted completely.

"aggregateLikes": 8976, "instructions": "To prepare the pesto: in a food processor, combine olives, parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic and pepperoncini and blend 1 minute. With motor running, slowly pour in olive oil until a thick, smooth paste is formed. Allow to stand 1/2 hour before using.To make the crust: After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. This amount of dough yielded 2 pizza crusts for my 12-inch cast iron skillet. But I stuffed the crust with cheese, so if you skip this step make your crust on the thicker side. If you're using an 8-inch skillet, you may get 3 crusts. Divide the dough evenly in half (or thirds). Roll out your dough just a little larger than the size of your skillet. Place on a large sheet of parchment paper and then place on a pizza peel or large pan flipped upside down. Instead of using parchment paper you can just place the dough on an extremely well floured pizza peel, but I found it was easier to be able to lift the pizza into the pan rather than sliding it in (my toppings fell of first try). Once your dough is on the peel place half to three fourths of the feta cheese around the outer edge of the dough. Roll the edges up and over the cheese pinching the dough to seal in the cheese. To make the pizza: Place an oven rack directly under your broiler and preheat your broiler to the highest setting. Additionally, place your cast iron skillet on the stovetop burner, turning the heat on high. You want to heat the skillet for 10 minutes. If it begins to smoke a lot, you can reduce the heat a bit. But you want it HOT.While the skillet is heating, begin placing your toppings on your dough. Remember, the dough MUST be on a well-floured pizza peel (or use parchment paper) so you can simply slide the entire thing into the skillet. Spread all of the pesto on one dough round. Top with shredded mozzarella cheese, roasted red peppers and the remaining feta cheese. Place a potholder or thick towel on the handle of the skillet (it will be sooo hot). Carefully slide the pizza into the skillet (or if using the parchment paper carefully lift the pizza and place in the pan), dough side down. After about 30 seconds, turn off the burner, grab the skillet and pop it in the oven, right under the broiler. Broil for 1 minute, then using the potholder, grab the handle and rotate 180 degrees, broiling for only 1 more minute. Remove immediately and place on the stovetop. Top with fresh basil and let cool slightly for about 5 minutes, then use a large spatula or carefully slide the pizza out to remove and drizzle with balsamic reduction.*To roast your own red peppers you can either broil one in the oven or place it directly on a gas top burner and char all sides of the pepper. Once all sides are charred remove the pepper from the broiler or stove top and place in a bowl and cover. Allow to sit for 5 minutes and remove and peel the charred parts away. Slice and use. *Balsamic glaze can be purchased in the Italian aisle of most grocery stores, or you can also make it yourself by simply reducing 1 cup of balsamic vinegar with a spoonful of brown sugar until thick and syrupy.Skillet method adapted from Bev Cooks", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/green-olive-pesto-pizza-with-feta-stuffed-crust-roasted-red-peppers-and-balsamic-drizzle-550048", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": true, "readyInMinutes": 93, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Squash--feta---bulghar-salad-217337.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 30, "id": 217337, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Squash, feta & bulghar salad", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 handfuls baby spinach, roughly chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "baby spinach", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spinach.jpg", "unitLong": "handfuls", "unitShort": "handfuls", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11457, "unit": "handfuls"}, {"originalString": "1 butternut squash, peeled, deseeded, cut into 3cm chunks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "butternut squash", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "deseeded", "cut into 3cm chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butternut-squash.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11485, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp chopped coriander", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "coriander", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2012, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1034053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp crumbled feta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": ["crumbled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1019, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp harissa paste", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "harissa", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/harissa-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1006972, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "juice 2 limes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lime", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9160, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "50g pumpkin seeds", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "pumpkin seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 12014, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 red onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "100g bulghar wheat", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "wheat bran", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bran.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 20077, "unit": "g"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipe/squash-feta-bulghar-salad", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 17, "aggregateLikes": 46, "instructions": "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.Place the squash on a baking sheetand toss with the harissa and someseasoning.

"For soaking the dried ingredients:1Place the dried shiitake mushrooms in a medium bowl, cover with 3 cups of warm water, and soak until softened, at least 5 hours or overnight.2Place the dried bean curd sticks and dried lily buds in separate large bowls, cover each with warm water, and let sit for 1 hour to soften, making sure they are submerged in the water and breaking up any lily buds that are sticking together.3Place the dried black moss and the dried black fungus in separate medium bowls. Cover each with warm water and let sit for 1 hour to soften, making sure they are submerged in the water.4Bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large 12-quart stockpot with a tightfitting lid. Remove from heat, add the deep-fried tofu and gluten balls, and submerge them by placing a small plate on top. Let sit 15 minutes to remove some of the oil from the tofu and gluten balls.For preparing the soaked ingredients:1Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shiitake mushrooms to a cutting board, being careful not to disturb the gritty sediment on the bottom of the bowl. Trim off the tough stems and cut each mushroom in half; set aside. Slowly pour 2 cups of the soaking liquid into a measuring cup, leaving the sediment behind; set aside. Discard the remaining liquid and sediment.2Drain the bean curd sticks and cut crosswise into 1-1/2-inch pieces; set aside.3Drain the lily buds and tie a knot in the middle of each; set aside.4Drain the moss, place in a medium bowl, add 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil and a large pinch of salt, and toss to combine; set aside.5Drain the black fungus; set aside.6Drain the tofu and gluten balls from the stockpot; clean the stockpot and set it aside. When the tofu and gluten balls are cool enough to handle, gently squeeze out some of the excess liquid; set aside.For cooking the jai:1Set the stockpot on the stovetop.2Heat a 14-inch wok over high heat until hot. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of the oil around the perimeter of the wok and add the shiitake and straw mushrooms in an even layer. Season with a large pinch of salt and a small pinch of sugar and, using a metal spatula, stir-fry until the mushrooms are fragrant and begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the stockpot.3One ingredient at a time, using 1 tablespoon of oil for each and seasoning with salt and sugar, stir-fry the bean curd sticks, moss, baby corn, and ginkgo nuts until softened slightly, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer each batch to the stockpot.4Using 1 tablespoon of the oil and seasoning with salt and sugar, stir-fry the tofu and gluten balls together until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the stockpot.5Using 1 tablespoon of the oil and seasoning with salt and sugar, stir-fry the canned and fresh bamboo shoots together until heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the stockpot.6Stir the ingredients in the stockpot together until thoroughly combined. Add the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, canned mushroom liquid, and enough water to just cover the ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.7Meanwhile, cut the napa cabbage in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces, discarding the core; set aside. Trim the ends off the bok choy and cut into 2-inch pieces (no need to cut if youre using baby bok choy hearts); set aside.8Heat the wok over high heat until hot. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of the oil around the perimeter and add the reserved cabbage and ginger. Season with a large pinch of salt and a small pinch of sugar and stir-fry until the cabbage just starts to wilt, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the stockpot.9Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of the oil around the perimeter of the wok and add the bok choy. Season with a large pinch of salt and a small pinch of sugar and stir-fry until the bok choy just starts to wilt, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the stockpot.10One at a time, using 1 tablespoon of oil for each and seasoning with salt and sugar, stir-fry the carrots, black fungus, and lily buds until coated in oil, about 1 minute. Transfer each batch to the stockpot.11Stir the jai together to thoroughly combine. Add enough water to just cover the ingredients and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until all the ingredients are cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the snow peas. Taste and season with salt and soy sauce as needed. If you choose, serve with steamed rice.

Special equipment: 3-inch round dough cutterFor the dough: In a small mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar and the cinnamon with a fork until it resembles wet sand. Set aside.In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and the remaining 2/3 cup granulated sugar until light in color. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Sift together the flour and salt. Slowly add the flour to the butter. Then add the chestnut meal and mix until a dough forms. With mixer on low speed, slowly add the cinnamon mixture 1 teaspoon at a time until all of the mixture is added. Mix until a swirl of the cinnamon sugar appears, about 10 seconds, and then turn the mixer off. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and tightly wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours.For the filling: Melt the brown sugar, butter, nutmeg and salt in a large high-sided saute pan. Add the apples and cook over medium heat. Add the sherry, then reduce the heat to low, and cook until the apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the pecans, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely. Fold the applesauce into the cooked apple mixture.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Dust a flat surface with flour. Roll the dough until 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. Using a 3-inch round dough cutter, cut out as many circles as you can, re-rolling any excess dough until it is all used up. Add a heaping teaspoon of the filling to the center of each dough circle. Fold the sides of a circle in three parts, pinching corners together as you go, to create a triangle with a window of filling in the center. Repeat for the remaining cookies. Place the cookies 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool the cookies before serving.

on a flat surface. Fold the parchment in half to create a crease, then open it up again. Place several slices of fennel bulb below the crease of the parchment paper in a mound, and sprinkle with salt. Place one fillet of salmon on top of the fennel bulb slices. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the salmon (anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon, or to taste). Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper. Lay sprigs of fennel fronds over the salmon. Lay 3 thin slices of lemon over the fennel fronds and salmon (more if you want). Or you could put the lemon sliced down first and top with the fronds, your choice. I think the slices on top look better. Dot the top with butter.</p><p>3 Fold the parchment over the salmon and secure close. There are several way that you can accomplish this. One easy and particularly attractive way is to fold a corner near the folded edge of the parchment paper into a triangle. Then about halfway down that triangle, fold another triangle over the previous triangle.  Working down and around the parchment edges, you can create folds all around the edges. When you come to the last folded edge, tuck the corner under the parchment.  There is an excellent video available that shows this technique here: How to Wrap Fish in Parchment. This technique works well with individual portions.</p><p>You may find it easier to wrap a large (multi serving) fillet in the following way. Arrange the fillet so that its long side is facing you, and the two shorter ends are to the left and right. Then lift up the parchment edges closest to you, and furthest from you, bring them together, and fold them over a few times.

sugars, egg, extracts, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add theflour, cornstarch,baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the coconut, almonds, chocolate chips,and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using alarge cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 13 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip - Strategically chocolate chips on top of each mound by taking chipsfrom the underside and adding them on top. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with aSilpator spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet)and bake for about 10 to 11 minutes (I baked for just under 11 minutes), or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Coconut is prone to burning and undersides of cookies can easily become too dark so watch them closely. Cookies will be pale and look un-done, but firm up as they cool.

"instructions": "<p>Ever since my brother started using the phrase \"I wanna get chocolate wasted\" from the movie Grown Ups, I've beenwanting to makethis cake for his birthday. Being a chocoholic myself, I had no trouble coming up with ways to fill this cake with layer upon layer of chocolatey goodness. Just looking at this cake, I think you'll agree that it definitely deserves its name.</p><p>Photo Credit: Ryan Rivera</p><p>To create this chocolate beauty, I baked two layers of delicious chocolate cake.Then, I drizzled each cakelayer with someKahlua. Iwanted to use chocolateliqueur like Godiva dark chocolate or white chocolate, but all I had on hand was Kahlua, which is acoffee-flavored liqueurand Disaronno, which is an almond-flavored liqueur. Either one would've worked well with the chocolate butsince my brother also loves coffee, I decided togo with theKahlua. Then, I filled and frosted the cake with rich chocolate buttercream.</p><p>Then, I completely covered the sides of the cake with Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips. The trick to doing this is to take a handful of chocolate chips and gently press themonto the cake. I placed the cake on a revolving cake stand and I had a large shallow bowl underneath it to catch any chocolate chips that may fall.</p><p>Next, Itopped the cake with anassortment of chocolate candies. For this cake, I used Hershey Kisses, Hershey bars, Kit Kat bars, Twix bars and Whoppers. With so many candy choices of out there, I'm sure I can make this cake dozens of times and have a differentbatch of candies to top the cake every time.</p><p>Last, I drizzled some melted chocolate all over thecake. I crisscrossed the melted chocolate on top and then poured more around the edges of the cake. Think Jackson Pollock.I made sure there was plenty of melted chocolate dripping down the sides of the cake. I think it makes it look even more decadent and mouthwatering.</p><p>I hope this cake inspires you to create your own chocolate wasted cake. What I love about this cake is it'sabsolutely over-the-topwith chocolateand yet it's pretty easy to make, even for a novice baker. It's the kind of cake you just wanna dive into and devour. You can use your own chocolate cake recipe and top it with all the chocolate candy your heart desires. And with Halloween just around the corner, I'm sure they'll be plenty of chocolatecandyaround to make this cake:-)</p><p>Special thanks to Jef at My Food Geek for sharing some food photography tips with me recently.

a shallow bowl or on a cutting board. Use a fork to mix and mash and fold the chives, shallot and salt into the butter, until everything is combined. Transfer half the compound butter to a small saucepan and set aside. (note: You can make the butter ahead and store it, tightly covered, in the fridge, for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 weeks. Bring it to room temperature before using.)Peel and slice the potatoes: Fill a large bowl halfway with cold water. Add vinegar. Peel potatoes, scraping a tiny bit extra off the bottom of each potato, with the peeler, to make a flat stable surface, so they don't roll around when you slice them. Place potatoes into the bowl of water, as you peel them, to prevent discoloration.Cut The Potato into Hasselbacks Take a potato out of the water and dry it. Lay it, lengthwise, between two wooden-handled spatulas or two chopsticks. The wood on either side of the potato will prevent you from cutting all the way through. (see instructional photos in post) Make slices, about  of an inch apart, along the entire length of the potato. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Place potatoes on baking sheet. Lightly coat each potato with olive oil, using a pastry brush.Cook and Baste The Hasselbacks: Bake for 35 minutes. Heat the chive butter in the saucepan just until it melts. Baste the top of each potato with about 1 teaspoon of melted butter, letting it drip into the slits. Bake for another 30-40 minutes longer, or until the potatoes are nicely browned in spots and cooked through.To Serve:  Serve hot. Just before serving top each potato with a teaspoon or two of compound butter. Season potatoes with sea salt and cracked pepper, to taste.

Heat a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and bacon and cook until the bacon is beginning to crisp, 8 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for an additional 3 minutes, until fragrant. Add the salt, tomato puree and cream; stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine for 1 minute less than the package instructions, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, remove the pasta from the water and add it directly to the pan with the sauce. Sprinkle the cheese directly on the naked pasta and toss to coat in sauce. Add up to 1 cup of the pasta water to loosen the sauce as needed. Stir in the arugula, basil, tarragon, peas and lobster meat; simmer until everything is heated through, 1 minute. Serve with additional Parmesan if desired.

and melted butter. Stir until thoroughly mixed.Pour the chocolate crumb mixture into a 9 inch pie pan. Using the back of a large spoon or the flat bottom of a measuring cup or drinking glass, press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly across the bottom and against the sides of the pie pan.Bake: Bake 10 minutes. The edges may be just slightly browned, but you do not want the edges or crust to over-brown. Remove from oven. Cool completely on a wire cooling rack.Chop the semisweet chocolate and unsweetened chocolate into small pieces. Set aside.Place the milk in the top of a double boiler. Sprinkle the gelatin over the milk. Let stand for about 5 minutes to soften.Set the top of the double boiler over simmering water. Add  cup of the sugar, the chopped chocolate, and egg yolks. Cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the chocolate is melted, and the mixture is slightly thickened and reaches 160 to 170 degrees using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla extract. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Place a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl on top of the simmering water, the upper pan should not touch the water.In a medium mixing bowl, whip the cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.In another medium mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on low speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, increase the mixer speed to high and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining  cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Set the whipped egg whites aside. The egg whites should be used within 20 minutes.Meanwhile, chill the cooked chocolate mixture by placing the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir occasionally for the first 10 minutes, and then stir frequently as the mixture begins to cool and thicken, about 10 minutes longer. Remove bowl from the ice water.After the chocolate mixture has cooled and thickened, immediately stir a large spoonful of the egg whites into the chocolate to lighten the mixture, and then fold the remaining egg whites in.Fold in the whipped cream until well incorporated, but leaving a few streaks of chocolate.Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust and refrigerate until set, at least 3 to 4 hours.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the cake mix, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the chocolate chips, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form 16 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. The dough is very sticky and gloppy; this is normal. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a\u00a0Silpat\u00a0or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet). If you had a hard time getting dough into neat mounds before chilling, take time now to smooth them out. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked and glossy in the center. Cookies firm up some as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Note that baking time is longer than for most cookies due to the very moist and wet nature of the dough and the size of the cookies. If you rolled your cookies smaller, reduce baking time accordingly. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

warmed, about 30 seconds. Whisk until smooth. Place mixture in refrigerator until just chilled, no longer than 30 minutes.For the cupcakes:Place chocolate and cocoa powder in a medium heatproof bowl. Pour hot coffee over mixture. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk mixture gently until smooth then transfer to refrigerator to cool completely, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with foil or paper liners.Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda together in a small bowl.Whisk oil, eggs, vinegar, and vanilla into cooled chocolate mixture until smooth. Whisk in flour mixture until smooth.Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop or a large spoon, divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups. Place 1 generous teaspoon of ganache on top of each batter-filled cup. Bake until cupcakes are set and firm to the touch, about 17 to 19 minutes. Let cupcakes cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from pan to cool completely, about 1 hour. Cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 day.For the frosting:Combine sugar, egg whites, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set bowl over a saucepan filled with 1-inch of gently simmering water. Whisking gently and constantly, heat mixture until sugar is dissolved and mixture is slightly thickened and foamy and registers 150\u00b0F on a candy thermometer or a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes.Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and beat egg white mixture on medium speed until slightly cooled and thickened, about 2 minutes. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, until smooth and creamy. Add chocolate and vanilla and mix until combined. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light, fluffy, and well combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Frosting can be made 1 day ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Warm frosting in the microwave for 5 to 10 seconds and stir until creamy again before frosting cupcakes.To assemble:If desired, spoon frosting in a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.

Whisk to combine. Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in fine meshed strainer and break them up with your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on top. Allow the excess water to blot out for at least 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip to coat. Lift it and gently pat off the excess flour. Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/hacker-free-neapolitan-pizza-for-a-home-kitchen-199262", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

Keep the skillet moving just until the cinnamon becomes fragrant. Take off heat (note that too long in the pan will burn the cinnamon). 2 Warm the milk, sugar, salt and cinnamon and 1 cup of the cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat whisking to incorporate the cinnamon into the liquid. 3 While the milk mixture warms set a bowl over another bowl filled with ice. Place the remaining cup of cream into the now chilling bowl and set a mesh strainer on top. 4 In a separate bowl whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to avoid the eggs scrambling.
