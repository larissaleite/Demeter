Sprinkle surface with 1/2 cup of cheese to evenly cover entire surface. Dust a rolling pin lightly with flour and then roll the rolling pin over the cheese to gently press the cheese into the puff pastry.Cut the puff pastry into long 1/2-inch-wide strips and then take each strip, fold in half and pinch the ends together. Now gently twist each strip several times.Take a piece of bacon and wrap it around the twisted pastry and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry and bacon until everything has been used. Add the brown sugar, rosemary, salt and pepper to a shallow bowl or pie plate and toss well. Now carefully take each bacon wrapped pastry one at a time and dip it through the brown sugar mixture, using your hands to coat all over the twist. Place each twist back on the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining twists. Bake the twist for 30 to 50 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. My bacon took 50 minutes to cook, but it was on the thicker side. I would start checking them at around 30 minutes and then every 5 to 10 minutes after that to make sure they are not burning.

However, I find the less scraping and interruptions, the better. The peanuts will go through stages of: crushed, crushed into a fine powder, a paste, a thicker paste, a big \u201cdough ball\u201d, and then the ball will break down into runnier peanut butter. At the point the peanut butter is runny, continue processing for about 1 to 2 more minutes, making sure the peanut butter is as smooth as desired. Add the vanilla, butterscotch chips, white chocolate chips (you may wish to start with 1 cup each of the butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips and increase to taste. I use 1 1/2 cups of each and the peanut butter is very sweet), the optional salt (I do not add salt; the salt from the honey roasted peanuts is enough for me) and process for 2 to 3 minutes, or until smooth and incorporated. I add the vanilla and baking chips all at once through the feed tube with the machine running, but if using a weaker or older food processor, sprinkling them in more slowly may prevent your machine from struggling. I do not melt them first or do anything other than simply adding them in whole. The power of the machine, coupled with the heat the peanut butter has taken on after 5 minutes of blending, is enough to incorporate them perfectly smoothly. Transfer peanut butter into a glass jar or other airtight container with a lid. Store peanut butter in the refrigerator or at room temperature. At room temperature, it firms up some but stays soft. In the refrigerator, because of the baking chips, it hardens and solidifies, but softens up again after ten minutes at room temperature. I estimate that it can be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks and in the refrigerator, it will keep for months; but of course, let common sense be your guide.\u00a0Recipe is gluten-free provided that the brands of peanuts and baking chips used are gluten-free.

Grease a 9 by 9-inch square baking pan.In a blender, puree the beans with the oil. Add the eggs, cocoa, sugar, coffee, and vanilla. Melt half the chocolate chips and add to the blender. Blend on medium-high until smooth. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to the blender and pulse until just incorporated. Stir in the remaining chocolate chips. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake until the surface looks somewhat matte around the edges and still a bit shiny in the middle, about 20 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting and removing from the pan. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.Cook's Note: Place a small cutout or stencil on the brownie before dusting to make a design.

Let those saute for 2 or 3 minutes.4) Then add in your ham. This should cook for ten minutes. You want your ham to just start to brown a bit.5) Then throw in all your beans. You want to stir well to make sure all your flavors are incorporated.6) Next add six cups of water and bring to a boil. Once the stew is boiling, turn down to low and let your soup simmer for one hour.7) After that hour, toss in your pearl onions and season with salt and pepper. You could add lots of other spices like oregano, red pepper flake, etc. I wanted to keep mine pretty simple though.8) Let this simmer for another 30 minutes and your beans should be tender and perfect.

strips. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil and a pinch of salt, and spread on a baking sheet. Cut the portabellas into 1/4-inch strips, and then toss in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt and place on a separate baking sheet. Roast for 7 to 8 minutes, then flip and roast until tender and starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. The portabellas may take a few minutes longer than the zucchini. Cool the vegetables. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.While the vegetables roast, mix 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, the pepper, nutmeg, ricotta, eggs, basil and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until well combined.Spread 1 1/2 cups of the marinara in the bottom of a baking dish and top with an even layer of uncooked lasagna noodles (about 5). Top the noodles with 1 1/2 cups of the ricotta mixture, spreading as evenly as possible. Evenly distribute half of the roasted veggies over the ricotta and top with 2 cups of the spinach. Add another 1 1/2 cups of marinara and another layer of noodles. Repeat with another 1 1/2 cups ricotta, the other half of the roasted vegetables, half of the mozzarella slices, the remaining 2 cups spinach, 1 1/2 cups of marinara, and then another layer of noodles. For the final layer, spread the remaining 1 1/2 cups ricotta, another layer of noodles, 1 1/2 cups of marinara, the remaining mozzarella slices, and then top with the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan.Bake for 1 hour covered with foil. Then remove the foil and bake until bubbly and beginning to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Rest the lasagna 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

Using a fork, incorporate the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, continue to work and then knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.Lightly coat a clean bowl with additional olive oil and add the dough, turning once to coat the dough in oil. Cover and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces, using 1 piece for the pizza. Wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze for another pizza.For the pizza: Stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle that will fit on the grill pan. Add the dough to the hot grill pan and cook until stiff and bubbles start to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until grill marks form and the dough is completely cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes.Transfer the crust to a baking sheet and top the pizza with the onions, potatoes, tomatoes and goat cheese. Add the loaded pizza to the oven and cook until the cheese melts, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately.

I like to use 1 tablespoon butter per side. Cover the top and bottom of the steak with seasoning. I really like to cover my steak in spice but the exact amount is up to you. Let the steak rest for about an hour on the counter.After an hour of resting start preheating the grill on high heat. Once the grill is nice and hot add the steak and be prepared for some flair ups. The butter will drip down into the grill so some flames will happen. Drop the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes until the steak is dark brown on the bottom and you see nice grill marks. Flip the steak and cook for another 5 minutes until you see those beautiful grill marks. Check the steak for doneness (you can use a thermometer) or by touching the meat. Rare: 120 degreesMedium Rare: 130 degreesMedium: 140 degreesMedium Well: 150 degreesWell: 160 degrees (please don't do this to your steak...sigh)Remove the steak from the grill and let the meat rest for at least 5 minutes before cutting into the meat. Also, keep in mind that the steak will rise in temperature for a bit of time after removing from the grill. Note: I use a gas grill. I realize charcoal is better BUT where I live I cannot have a charcoal grill so we have gas.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-high heat, or prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill.In a small saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, tequila and 1/4 cup water. Set the pan on the grill (or a side burner on medium-high heat) and cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from the heat and let stand until cool.Put the pineapple slices in a baking dish and pour the cooled syrup over them, tossing gently to coat. Let stand at least 5 minutes and up to 30 minutes.Whip the heavy cream in a bowl to the soft-peak stage. Refrigerate until ready to use.Spread the butter on both sides of each pound cake slice and grill, turning once, until light golden, about 1 minute per side. Drain the pineapple, reserving the syrup, and grill, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side.To assemble, place each pound cake slice on a dessert plate and top with 2 pineapple rings. Drizzle a little of the tequila syrup over each plate, top with a dollop of whipped cream and garnish with a mint sprig and some chopped mint.

slabs all over with the rib rub, coating evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 hours.Remove from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Place the wood chips in the bottom of the smoker and position the drip tray and wire rack over the top according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the ribs on the wire rack and position the lid over the top of the smoker, leaving slightly ajar. Place the smoker over a high fire and heat until smoke begins to exit the smoker. Reposition the lid so that the smoker is completely covered and place the ribs in the oven. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until the ribs are cooked through and tender.Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Change the oven setting to broil and position an oven rack about 6 inches from the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.Transfer the ribs to the baking sheet, meat side up, and brush the barbecue sauce evenly over the 2 portions of ribs. Broil the ribs until the sauce is bubbly and ribs are browned around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes, rotating sheet pan once after 2 minutes of cooking to ensure even browning. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before cutting into individual ribs and serving.

    For the Pastry Cream: Pour the milk into a medium pot. Use a sharp knife to slit the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the milk. Put the bean in the milk as well. Heat the milk until almost boiling (bubbles will begin to form at the edges). Cover and let steep for 1 hour if time permits, otherwise proceed as directed.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a medium bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth. Set the bowl on a kitchen towel or nonskid surface and whisk the eggs while pouring about 1/2 cup of the hot milk into them to temper. Gradually pour in the rest of the milk, whisking constantly. Pour the contents of the bowl into the pan and set over medium-low heat.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a slow boil, about 2 minutes. Immediately strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container. Discard the vanilla bean or wash and reuse it. Let the pastry cream cool to room temperature, 10 minutes, and then whisk in the butter. You want the butter to be incorporated without being melted.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Cover the pastry cream with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            For the P\u00e2te Sucr\u00e9e: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the butter and beat until mixture is the consistency of cornmeal, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of the cream. Add to the flour mixture and stir with a fork until just combined. If the dough does not come together into large chunks, slowly add the remaining cream, a little bit at a time, until it does. Gather the dough into a ball, pat it into a disk, and wrap it tightly in plastic. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Divide the dough to make the portions you need and again pat gently into disks. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each dough disk into a round about 1/4 inch thick and about 1 inch greater in diameter than the pan you are using (8 inches for a 7-inch pan; 4 inches for 3 1/2-inch tartlet pans). Drape the rolled-out dough into the tart pan(s), gently pushing it into the bottom edges and against the pan sides to make a strong and straight shell. Trim the edges flush with the rim of the pan(s) using a sharp knife, or roll the rolling pin over the edges to cut off the excess dough. Prick all over the bottom with the tines of a fork and place in the freezer to firm up for 30 minutes. (To store unbaked, wrap the dough ball tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 months, or line the tart shell(s) with the dough as desired, cover with plastic wrapp, and freeze for up to 3 days. Thaw the frozen dough ball in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours before rolling and shaping. Bake lined and frozen shells straight out of the freezer.)                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            To partially blind-bake the tart shell(s), place in the oven directly from the freezer and bake just until no longer translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. To fully blind-bake the tart shell(s), bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before filling and proceeding the recipe. Store fully baked shells, wrapped tightly in plastic, at room temperature for up to 3 days.                                                                                                                             10                                                                            To assemble the Pastry Cream and Fresh Fruit Tart:  If making the pastry cream now, let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 to 3 hours.                                                                                                                             11                                                                            Make the P\u00e2te Sucr\u00e9e and line a 7-inch tart pan as directed. Fully prebake the shell, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Spread the cold pastry cream evenly into the cooled tart shell. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

Stir intermittently. Add the garlic and cook about 30 seconds, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Remove from heat and set pan aside. In a large heavy-bottom pot (I use thisLe Creuset Signature Enameled Cast-Iron 6-3/4-Quart Oval French (Dutch) Oven)add 4 tablespoons butter, flour, and cook over medium heat for about 3 to 5 minutes, whisking constantly, until flour is thickened. You are making a roux and it's very important the mixture is thick or soup will never thicken properly later. Slowly add the vegetable stock, whisking constantly. Slowly add the half-and-half, whisking constantly. Allow mixture to simmer over low heat for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened some. Whisk intermittently to re-incorporate the 'skin' that inevitably forms, this is normal. While mixture is simmering, chop the broccoli and carrots. After simmering 15 to 20 minutes, add the broccoli, carrots, and the onion and garlic you previously set aside. Add the salt, pepper, optional paprika, optional dry mustard powder, and optional cayenne. If you don't have these seasonings on hand, it's okay, but they do add subtle depth of flavor. Stir to combine. Allow soup to simmer over low heat for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened some. Whisk intermittently to re-incorporate the 'skin' that inevitably forms, this is normal. While soup simmers, grate the cheese. It's important to use a high-quality cheese (not the cheapest thing you can find) because the flavor of the soup depends on it. Do not use pre-grated cheese in ziptop bags because that cheese is resistant to melting and won't incorporate well. After simmering about 20 to 25 minutes, add most of the cheese, reserving a small amount for garnishing bowls. Stir in the cheese until melted and incorporated fully, less than 1 minute. Transfer soup to bowls, garnish with reserved cheese, and serve immediately. Soup will keep airtight for 5 to 7 days in the fridge. Reheat gently in the microwave. I find the soup is less likely to 'break' or separate when reheated in the micro rather than on the stovetop, but do what you think is best. I don't recommend freezing the soup because I feel like the cheese and half-and-half will not do well upon thawing and soup could break, but I haven't actually tried freezing it.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/the-best-broccoli-cheese-soup-better-than-panera-copycat-626154", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Macheesmo", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sweet-potato-stuffed-shells-536812.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 536812, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sweet Potato Stuffed Shells", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Macheesmo", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 large yams, boiled and mashed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "yams", "metaInformation": ["boiled", "large", "mashed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11601, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "6 fresh sage leaves, minced", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "fresh sage leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sage.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2038, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "red pepper flakes", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1032009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup Greek yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "greek yogurt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup walnuts, chopped", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "walnuts", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/walnuts.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 12155, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 28 ounce can tomato sauce", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "canned tomato sauce", "metaInformation": ["canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 28.0, "id": 11549, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "6 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "mozzarella cheese", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mozzarella-fresh.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1026, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "Salt and pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "Fresh chives (garnish)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh chives", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "(garnish)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11156, "unit": "serving"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 79.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.macheesmo.com/2012/01/sweet-potato-stuffed-shells/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 14, "aggregateLikes": 279, "instructions": "Directions1) Peel and cube yams and boil them in salted water until they are very tender, about 12-15 minutes.
