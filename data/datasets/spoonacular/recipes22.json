"instructions": "For the crust:Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Remove pie crusts from package. Lightly dust a working surface with flour then unroll and stack pie crusts on top of each other. Roll crust out to a 17 by 12-inch rectangle. Fold crust half then fold in half again and transfer to a 15 by 10 by 1-inch jelly roll pan (this is smaller than a sheet pan). Carefully unfold dough and fit and gently press into the pan. Fold crust under even with the edges of the pan and decorate as desired (the fork technique would also be good here since there's not much excess crust to work with). Transfer to refrigerator to chill until ready to fill.For the topping:In a medium mixing bowl stir together granulated sugar and brown sugar while breaking up any clumps of brown sugar as needed. Mix in quick oats, flour and salt then add butter and cut butter into mixture using a pastry cutter until crumbly (or rub butter into mixture with your fingertips). Transfer topping to refrigerator.For the filling:In a small mixing bowl whisk together granulated sugar and brown sugar while breaking up an clumps of brown sugar as needed. Mix in flour, cinnamon nutmeg and salt. Place apples in a large mixing bowl then pour lemon juice over apples and toss to evenly coat. Pour sugar mixture over apples and toss to evenly coat.To assemble pie:Remove crust from refrigerator. Pour apples over crust and spread and gently press into an even layer. Remove topping from refrigerator. Sprinkle topping evenly over pie. Bake in preheated oven 33 - 38 minutes, while tenting with foil during the last 10 minutes or so as needed to prevent excess browning, until apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick. Remove from oven and let cool until warm.For the glaze (or again, just serve with vanilla ice cream):In a mixing bowl whisk together powdered sugar and half and half, adding a little more half and half as needed 1 tsp at a time, until the consistency is somewhat thick but runs nicely. Transfer to a sandwich size resealable bag, cut a small tip from one corner then drizzle over pie. Cut pie into squares and serve warm.Recipe source: adapted from Pillsbury and BHG", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/crumb-topped-apple-slab-pie-828156", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 15, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Casaveneracion", "cuisines": ["chines", "asian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Yang-Chow-(Yeung-Chow--Yang-Zhou)-fried-rice-521938.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 521938, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Yang Chow (Yeung Chow, Yang Zhou) fried rice", "creditText": "Casaveneracion", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 c. of cold cooked rice, sprinkled with a little water and stirred to separate the grains", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "cooked rice", "metaInformation": ["with a little water and stirred to separate the grains", "cold", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-uncooked.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 10220445, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "3 eggs, lightly beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["lightly beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tbsps. of oyster sauce (optional)", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "oyster sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oyster-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6176, "unit": "tbsps"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsps. of peanut (or soya or vegetable) oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "peanut oil", "metaInformation": ["(or soya or vegetable)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4042, "unit": "tbsps"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd c. of sweet peas (thawed and drained if frozen)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peas", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "thawed", "drained", "( and if )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11304, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd c. of chopped char siu pork (see note at the end)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "pork", "metaInformation": ["chopped", "(see note at the end)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10010219, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 pc. of Chinese sausage (longganisa Macau), roughly chopped", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "sausage", "metaInformation": ["chinese", "roughly chopped", "(longganisa Macau)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1017063, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "a bunch of scallions (onion leaves), cut into one-inch lengths", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["cut into one-inch lengths", "(onion leaves)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "bunch", "unitShort": "bunch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11291, "unit": "bunch"}, {"originalString": "a drizzle of sesame seed oil", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sesame seed oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4058, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd c. of chopped fresh shrimps", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "shrimps", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 15152, "unit": "c"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 52.0, "sourceUrl": "http://casaveneracion.com/yang-chow-yeung-chow-yang-zhou-fried-rice/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "aggregateLikes": 33, "instructions": "InstructionsMethod 1: Heat the cooking oil in a wok.

It's easiest if you use a spoon to drop spoonfuls of frosting all over the cheesecake layer and then gently smooth them to form an even layer of frosting.Pour remaining cheesecake mixture on top and smooth with a spatula.Place on a baking sheet and bake in a 325 degree oven for 60 minutes. Turn oven off, crack door open and leave cheesecake in oven for 60 more minutes.Set cheesecake on counter, run a knife around the edges, and remove sides of springform pan.Spread remaining frosting on top.

Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop.Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and salt onto a large piece of parchment (or into a medium bowl). Beat the granulated sugar, brown sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium high and add the eggs, one at a time; beat until light and smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the applesauce, orange zest and vanilla and beat until just smooth. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add the carrots and 3/4 cup walnuts and beat until just combined.Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove to the rack to cool completely; remove the parchment. (The cake layers can be made a day ahead; let cool completely, then wrap in plastic wrap.)Make the frosting: Peel the ginger and grate onto a piece of cheesecloth. Wrap in the cheesecloth and squeeze the juice into a small bowl (you should get about 1 tablespoon). Add the orange juice and vanilla to the bowl. Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in the juice mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until smooth, about 2 more minutes.Place 1 cake layer on a platter, rounded-side down. Spread with 1 cup frosting, then top with the second cake layer, rounded-side down. Cover the top and sides with the remaining frosting. Press the remaining walnuts into the sides of the cake. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

Mix well with a fork.Tear off 3 sheets of aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the rib rack. Stack the foil sheets on top of each other and place on a baking sheet. Place the ribs on the foil and generously massage the rub into the ribs. Let them sit for 1 hour on the counter.To make the barbecue sauce, heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for another minute. Turn down the heat to medium low and add the teriyaki sauce, sriracha ketchup, hot pepper paste, molasses and lime juice. Simmer to thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Divide the sauce between 2 bowls.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Brush half of the sauce on both sides of the ribs. Wrap the ribs up with the foil. Place 2 large ramekins or heatproof bowls underneath the ribs so they are elevated above the baking sheet.Cook the ribs until just getting tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove the ribs from the oven and raise the temperature to 425 degrees F. Uncover the foil packet, brush the remaining barbecue sauce onto the top of the ribs and cook for an additional 30 to 40 minutes to allow the ribs to caramelize.Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with Aren't Ya Glad I Didn't Say Orange Banana Ketchup on the side.                                                Aren't Ya Glad I Didn't Say Orange Banana Ketchup:                                        Heat the canola oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Break the bananas up into chunks and add them to the skillet. Mash them up with a potato masher or fork. Stir in the granulated sugar, salt and 1/3 cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.Transfer the mixture to a blender, let cool slightly, add the lime juice and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Pour the rice into a medium mixing bowl and cover it with 2 inches of cold water. Let the rice soak for 90 minutes.Drain the rice in a colander and rinse again with cold water, shake out the excess water. Rinse and dry the mixing bowl and set aside.Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a 5 quart nonstick pot (using a pot with a nonstick surface is important; it will help in the formation of the crispy tahdig). Pour in the rice, beans, and salt. Stir. Bring the water back to a boil. Let the mixture boil uncovered on medium high for 8 minutes. Stir the rice periodically during cooking.While rice is boiling, crush the saffron threads in a mortar and pestle. Pour 1/2 cup of hot water into the mortar and let the saffron soak.After 8 minutes of boiling, pour the rice into a colander and rinse with lukewarm water, then drain. Rinse and dry the pot and put it back on the stove. Stir the fresh chopped dill into the rice in the colander, making sure it is well mixed throughout the rice. I use about 1 cup of chopped dill; you can use more if you like a very green rice with a strong dill flavor. In the medium mixing bowl, stir together 1/2 cup vegetable oil, half of the saffron water, and 1 1/2 cups of the cooked rice.Spread the oil and rice mixture in an even layer on the bottom of the pot. This will become your tahdig. Scoop the rest of the rice out of the colander and into the pot, forming a volcano-shaped mound in the middle of the pot. Make a hole in the center of the volcano with the handle of a wooden spoon, pushing it almost to the bottom of the pot.Place a thin kitchen towel over the top of the pot, being careful not to let the towel get too close to the heat source. Place the lid tightly over the top of the towel. Turn on the heat to medium and let the rice steam for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, mix together the remaining saffron water with remaining 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. After 10 minutes, remove the towel and lid from the pot and pour the saffron oil mixture evenly over the top of the rice.Replace the towel and lid. Turn heat to low. Let the mixture steam for 45-50 minutes longer.Move the pot to a cool surface and let it rest for 5 minutes. When ready to serve, you have two options. Option 1: Scoop the rice out of the pot and mound it onto a serving plate or tray, leaving a thin layer of rice undisturbed at the bottom of the pot. Use a spatula to loosen the crispy tahdeeg from the bottom of the pot and arrange the pieces around the cooked rice. Garnish with a little fresh dill, if desired.Option 2: Place a large serving plate upside down on top of the pot. Invert the pot quickly and gently unmold the rice from the pot. This will keep the tahdig intact and create a cake-like effect with the rice.Serve hot.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/persian-dill-and-lima-bean-rice-533168", "vegetarian": true,

    The night before, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with cold water at least twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a medium saucepan over high heat and add the drained chickpeas and baking soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas will need to cook between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Drain the chickpeas. You should have roughly 3 2/3 cups/600 g now. Place the chickpeas in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then, with the machine still running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you get a very smooth and creamy paste.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer the hummus to a bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
