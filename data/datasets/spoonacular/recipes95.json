Turn the heat to medium and gently nestle the pieces of browned chicken into the sauce, making room for all six chicken breast cutlets. The chicken should be mostly covered with the sauce. Cover the skillet and simmer the sauce and chicken on medium or medium low for 15 minutes, checking every few minutes to make sure the chicken isn\u2019t sticking to the bottom of the skillet.

Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour or up to 4.Set the stand mixer bowl back on the mixer and with the whisk attachment, beat on medium, gradually adding the cream.

In a mini food processor, combine garlic, rosemary, thyme, wine, oil, Dijon mustard, and 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard. Grind the mustard sauce until combined, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl. Add remaining 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard to the sauce and stir to combine. Set aside mustard sauce.Preheat the broiler. Line a heavy rimmed baking sheet with foil. Spray the foil with nonstick spray. Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Broil for 2 minutes. Spoon the mustard sauce over the fillets. Continue broiling until the fillets are just cooked through and golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.Transfer the fillets to plates and serve with lemon wedges.                                                            Recommended Wine: 2001 PeccheninoOrigin: Alba, PiedmontGrape: DolcettoWine notes: Using white wine for fish and red wine for meat no longer applies.  Break with tradition.  Italy produces many interesting reds, so for this dish I chose a classic Italian wine made from the dolcetto grape.  This lighter bodied red will marry well with my salmon dish which has a rich and silky texture.  The delicacy of the herbs in my mustard glaze goes nicely with the fruity nature of the wine.  My rule for pairing wine with dishes is to go with what tastes good.Wine Pouring Notes:  Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine's aroma and a better sense of its bouquet.  To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine's beautiful aroma.

edges of the pan with cooking spray, and then wiping gently with a paper towel.Grind the Oreos into fine crumbs using a food processor or blender.In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter for 45 to 60 seconds until the butter is melted.In a separate medium-size bowl, pour the melted butter into the Oreo crumbs and stir until there are no dry crumbs left.Pour the crumbs into your springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up on the sides to create a thick crust. Refrigerate the crust while you are preparing the pudding.For the pudding: Measure out all of the ingredients for the pudding prior to starting.In a medium-size saucepan, add the cold water and sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Allow the gelatin to sit for about 2 minutes until firm.Place the egg yolks in a separate bowl and whisk lightly.Once the gelatin is firm, turn the heat to medium-low and allow the gelatin to dissolve back into liquid.Quickly add the milk and vanilla extract and continuing to whisk over medium-low heat.Add the granulated sugar and vanilla cake mix and whisk constantly to dissolve the dry ingredients into the milk.Once the mixture is warm but not hot, pour about  cup of the milk into the eggs and whisk vigorously. You will need to work quickly to prevent the eggs from becoming scrambled.Immediately pour the egg yolks back into the pan and whisk constantly until the pudding starts to thicken and lightly bubble.Remove the pudding from the heat and immediately strain the pudding through a fine sieve into the prepared crust. This step is optional, but it will help catch any lumps of ingredients that did not get blended.Immediately cover the top of the pudding with clear plastic wrap (directly on the surface of the pudding) and poke a few holes with a toothpick.Allow it to cool on the counter for at least 1 hour before refrigerating. Refrigerate the pie for 4 to 6 hours until the filling is firm before adding the topping.For the whipping topping: Place the mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.Pour the heavy whipping cream into the chilled bowl and use an electric mixer to beat the heavy cream on medium-high speed until the cream gets bubbly.Slowly add the vanilla cake mix and powdered sugar and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form.Pipe the whipped cream using a large open star tip or spread the whipped cream over the top of the pie and garnish with sprinkles.This pie must be refrigerated.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/no-bake-funfetti-pudding-pie-797084", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30,

sugar, stevia.Once blended, mix in the egg, molasses and applesauce. Once that's together, it will look curdled, which is how its supposed to look.Next, to the same bowl add in all the dry ingredients at once...starting with the oat flour, then baking soda, baking powder and all the spices (ginger, cinnamon, allspice). Mix until blended together and forms a dough.Take dough, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours. I chilled mine for 3 hours. You can chill for even longer, but if you chill it too long, it will just be a bit tougher to roll out.When ready to bake your cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out dough between 2 large pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap.A trick I used to make it easier to roll out is holding the end of the parchment paper by folding the end piece over the counter and holding it with my hips! That way, I could roll it out without the paper moving. Its a stiff dough like regular gingerbread, so it takes a bit of muscle to roll it out.Once the dough is to a thickness you like, cut into shapes. To avoid your cookie cutter from sticking, dip it in a bit of oat flour and shake off the excess.\u00a0 The amount of cookies you get depend on the shape you use. Once you cut out your shapes, keep rolling out the remaining dough until you have none left.Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the cookies. I baked mine for 10 minutes. I'd say they were average thickness. If they are fairly thin, I'd bake for 8 minutes, then check. You just want the cookies firm, and there will be no thumbprint if you press them. You can't tell by color on these when you pull them out.Cool on a cookie sheet and transfer to a cooling rack.Add icing with a piping bag if desired. I didn't measure the icing I made and I had lots left over, so I can't include in nutrition. I added 1.5 Tbsp butter with approx 2 cups icing sugar, pinch of cream of tartar and a bit of unsweetened almond milk. Just whipped to a spreadable consistency. I added it to a piping bag and decorated. Since I didn't add too much icing to mine, my guess would be its adding about 30 more calories per cookie and a few grams of sugar.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gingerbread-cut-out-cookies-558828", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 28, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Copy Kat", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Brownie-Bottom-Cheesecake-600993.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 80, "id": 600993, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Brownie Bottom Cheesecake", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Copy Kat", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 squares Bakers Unsweetened Chocolate", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "bakers white chocolate", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-chocolate.jpg", "unitLong": "squares", "unitShort": "squares", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19087, "unit": "squares"}, {"originalString": "Brownie Bottom", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brownie mix", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brownies-isolated-all.png", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 18632, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 stick butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "stick", "unitShort": "stick", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "stick"}, {"originalString": "Cheese Cake", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cheese cake mix", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 98951, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "3 8 ounce package cream cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "3 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1056, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup Sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 25.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.copykat.com/2009/02/06/brownie-bottom-cheesecake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 38, "aggregateLikes": 47, "instructions": "BrownieMelt butter and chocolate in a heavy pan over low heat, stirring constantly, cool.

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, brown sugar and peanut butter on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat to combine.4. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the oats, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and Reese's Pieces candies by hand.5.

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan, line it with parchment paper and butter the paper. Put the pan on a baking sheet.2. To make the brownie batter, put both chocolates and the butter in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stirring occasionally, heat just until the ingredients are melted, shiny and smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat. Alternatively, you can microwave the chocolates and butter together in 30-second increments, stirring well after each one.3. Working with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the sugar and eggs on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, until pale, thick and creamy. Beat in the salt and vanilla extract. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the melted chocolate and butter, mixing only until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then, still on low speed, add the flour, mixing only until it disappears into the batter. Using the spatula, fold in the walnuts, and scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Set aside.4. To make the cookie dough, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.5. Working with the stand mixer in a cleaned bowl or with the hand mixer in another large bowl, beat the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. One at a time, add the egg and the yolk, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients, mixing only until they disappear into the dough. Still on low, mix in the chopped chocolate. Drop the cookie dough by spoonfuls over the brownie batter and, using a spatula and a light touch, spread it evenly over the batter.6. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the cookie top is deep golden brown and firm and a thin knife inserted into the brownie layer comes out with only faint streaks of moist chocolate. Transfer the pan to a rack and cool to room temperature.7. When the brownies are completely cool, carefully run a knife between the sides of the pan and the brownies, then invert them onto another rack, remove the paper and turn right side up onto a cutting board.

Cover and store in refrigerator overnight.You can skewer the chicken and grill it on an outdoor grill or use a grill pan stove top. If using wooden skewers soak in water for a half hour or so before grilling. Skewer each piece twice lengthwise. Grill on all sides until cooked through.Serve on warm flat or pita bread with tzatziki sauce (and/or Greek dressing - recipe below) garnished with fresh vegetables like tomato, onion and lettuce.Sprinkle the diced cucumber lightly with salt and drain in a wire strainer over a bowl in the refrigerator 1-2 hours ahead of time.Combine with the sour cream, feta, garlic, lemon and dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Store in refrigerator.In a food processor emulsify the first 3 ingredients together. Mix in the garlic, lemon zest and seasonings.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, grind the flour, almonds, sugar, and salt until the almonds are very fine and powdery. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is in very small pieces about the size of grains of rice. (Be careful not to over-process the mixture or the resulting crust will become dense and tough.)2. Add the egg yolks and the almond extract to the processor, then let the machine run just until the dough starts to come together. (Again, be careful not to over-process the dough.) Transfer the dough to a work surface, knead it briefly with your hands until smooth, then press the dough into a disk.3. Very lightly butter a 9-inch (23 centimeter) tart pan with a removable bottom. Transfer the disk of dough to the pan. Using your hands, lightly press the dough as evenly as possible into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Freeze the dough-lined tart pan for at least 30 minutes.4. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).5. Set the tart pan on a baking sheet and prick the frozen tart dough about 10 times with a fork. Line the dough with a sheet of aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the tart shell on the baking sheet until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights and continue to bake until the tart shell is deep golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Let cool completely.Make the tart filling6. Spread the raspberry jam over the cooled tart shell in an even layer.7. Trim the hard stem ends from the figs and quarter each fig lengthwise. Arrange the figs in the tart shell in 2 concentric circles, cut sides up, fitting the figs snugly against the sides of the tart shell and each other. Arrange the raspberries snugly in the center of the tart. Drizzle the warm honey over the tart.8. Remove the tart pan sides from the tart pan bottom by setting the tart on an overturned bowl or other tall, wide surface (a large can of tomatoes works well). Gently press down on the outer ring and let it fall to the countertop. Set the tart on a flat surface. Release the tart from the pan bottom by sliding the blade of a knife between the crust and the pan bottom, then slip the tart onto a serving plate.

degrees F (but no more than 110 degrees). Remove from heat and sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar and flour over the surface of the liquid. Set aside without stirring, until foamy and rising up the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.Whisk the butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture.Whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to make a thick, shaggy, and slightly sticky dough. Stir in currants. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Shape into a ball.Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put dough in bowl, turning to coat lightly with butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. (If you have a marker, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time to help you keep track.)To form the rolls: Butter a 9 by 14-inch baking pan. Turn the dough out of the bowl and pat into a rectangle about 16 by 8 inches. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, about 2 ounces each, with a pizza wheel or bench scraper. (If you don't have a scale, divide the dough in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise. Cut each of those four sections into 3 equal-sized rolls.)Tuck the edges of the dough under to make round rolls and place them seam-side down in the prepared pan, leaving a little space in between each roll. Cover the pan with buttered plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the rolls rise almost to the rim of the pan and have more than doubled in size, about 45 minutes.Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.Remove the plastic wrap and brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg. Bake rolls until golden brown and puffy, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the rolls registers 190 degrees F, about 25 minutes.For the glaze: Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, lemon zest and vanilla until smooth. Transfer icing to a zip bag or pastry bag, and make a small cut in the corner of the bag. Ice buns in a thick cross shape over the top of the warm buns.

Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the dry ingredients, mixing only until a little flour remains. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chocolate chips. 4. With a medium cookie scoop (or 2 tablespoons), form dough into balls and place on prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake until the outside edges are just set and light golden brown, and the middles are still puffy, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

Set a timer if you think you may forget to retrieve it before it freezes completely.Place slices in a 1 gallon, resealable plastic bag. Pour hoisin sauce mixture over slices, and mix well. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.  Conversely, you may marinate the whole flank steak.Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.  Discard marinade and, if cooking on skewers, thread the sliced steak on the soaked skewers.  If cooking whole, allow the steak to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to grilling.Over high heat, grill skewers 2 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.For the whole steak, grill for approximately 6-8 minutes per side for medium rare. This will depend a bit on the thickness of the steaks.  (Our last steak was about 1-inch thick and took the higher end of this range.)  Flank steak will be more tender if cooked to medium rare.  Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to redistribute.  Then, slice thinly across the grain.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/asian-beef-skewers-or-whole-flank-steak-482242", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Rachel Cooks", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Blackberry-and-Blueberry-Crumb-Bars-493460.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 49, "id": 493460, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Blackberry and Blueberry Crumb Bars", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Rachel Cooks", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup blackberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blackberries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blackberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9042, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9050, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cardamom", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cardamom.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2006, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 cups light brown sugar, firmly packed", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 19334, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 cups oats (quick or old-fashioned -- I used a mix of both)", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "oats", "metaInformation": ["quick", "( or old-fashioned -- I used a mix of both)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "cold", "small", "cut into  pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 27.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.rachelcooks.com/2014/03/19/blackberry-blueberry-crumb-bars/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "aggregateLikes": 969, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.In a small saucepan, mix together sugar and cornstarch.

F. Put 1/2 cup flour, the yeast and sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. With the motor running, add 3/4 cup hot tap water (about 115 degrees F). Turn off the motor and add the cornmeal, cheese, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 cup flour. Pulse until the dough forms a ball, then continue pulsing until smooth but still wet, about 15 more times.Make the pizzettes: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, 12 to 15 times, dusting lightly with flour if too wet to handle. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 1/4-inch-thick disk, about 14 inches across. Using a 3-inch-round cutter, cut the dough into 16 rounds, gathering and rerolling the scraps if needed. Transfer the rounds to the prepared pans.Mix the olive oil, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Brush each round lightly with the herb oil, then top each with a slice of soppressata and 2 to 3 tomato slices. Sprinkle with the parmesan. Bake one sheet at a time, until the crusts are golden, about 8 minutes.Drizzle the pizzettes with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and top with the basil leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature.Photograph by Anna Williams                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

Place flattened biscuit in prepared pan, pressing it down firmly into base\u00a0and around sides. Repeat with 7 remaining biscuits. Tip - Biscuits rise and puff in oven and I recommend staggering biscuits in pan since you'll have 4 extra empty cavities; set pan aside. To a large bowl add the vegetables, soup, optional chicken, optional salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Before adding the filling, press biscuits down one more time firmly into\u00a0pan. They have a tendency to spring up and you want the maximize amount of area for the filling. Scoop about 1/3 cup filling mixture into each biscuit, dividing it equally. Filling should be just slightly domed above top edge of biscuit. Bake for about 23 minutes or until edges of biscuits are very lightly golden brown and filling has set up some. Start watching closely at 18 minutes since all ovens and ingredients vary. Allow pot pies to cool in pan for about 5 minutes before removing and serving. They will shrink some as they cool.

out the dough to an 11-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom and trim the edges. (Alternatively, a 9-inch pie pan can be used.) Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Line the pastry with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust is set, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the paper and weights and bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.In a medium skillet, cook the bacon until crisp and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Discard the fat or reserve for another use. Arrange the bacon evenly over the bottom of the baked crust. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, yolks, and half and half. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk to combine. Pour into the prepared crust and bake until the custard is golden, puffed, and set yet still slightly wiggly in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving. Serve with Simple Salad.                                                Flaky Butter Crust:                                        To make the dough in a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter in the processor and process until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, add the ice water through the feed tube and pulse quickly 5 or 6 times, or until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the container. Gather the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.To make the dough by hand, combine the flour, salt, and butter in a medium bowl, and mix with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time and mix until the dough comes together and is no longer dry, being careful not to overmix. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface according to the recipe, fit it into the pan, and allow to rest again in the refrigerator before baking. Yield: one 9-inch tart or pie crust                                                Simple Salad:                                        Beat the vinegar in a bowl with the sugar, garlic, salt and pepper until sugar and salt dissolves. Then beat in the oil by droplets, whisking constantly. (Or place all the ingredients in a screw-top jar and shake to combine.) Taste and adjust the seasonings. Toss a few tablespoons of the dressing with the salad mix and serve immediately. If not using dressing right away, cover and refrigerate, whisking or shaking again before use.
