You should have about 1 cup after it has been crushed.Take the crumbs and mix them with the sugar in a medium bowl. Add in the melted butter and really stir to coat the crumbs evenly. I found it worked the best to just get my hands in there and mix it up.Press the Brownie Brittle/butter crumb mixture into the prepared baking pan, making sure to really pack it down tightly and evenly.Bake until the edges of the crust begin to just harden, about 20 minutes. The crust will seem under-baked, but it hardens a lot as it cools!In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and sugar until it\u2019s light and fluffy. Beat in the flour until it is just well combined \u2013be careful not to over-mix and add in too much air as this causes cracks in your cheesecake! It only takes a minute or so to combine the flour.Melt the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. I find it works the best to use 50% power and microwave using 20 second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the chocolate is smooth and melted.Stir the chocolate, vanilla, Greek yogurt and egg white into the cheesecake mixture.

Whisk until blended. Pour the dressing over the leaves and gently massage the dressing into the leaves until they are all lightly coated. Take a little bite, and add more lime juice and salt if you find it too bitter.To cook the refried beans: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot is tender and turning translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin and chili powder and cook, while stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the drained beans and water. Let the mixture come to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Remove from heat and mash the beans with a potato masher, pastry cutter or fork until the mixture is thick and spreadable.To cook the quesadillas: Spread the bean mixture evenly over each tortilla. Warm a medium-to-large skillet over medium heat. Transfer one tortilla to the warmed skillet and sprinkle about one-fourth of the cheese over the bean mixture. Spread a handful of marinated broccoli rabe leaves over one-half of the tortilla, leaving any large buds in the bowl. Once the cheese is melting, fold the cheesy side over the broccoli rabe.

Then use a knife to section the onion into 16ths, beginning with your knife 1/8-inch away from the root and cutting straight down. Once all cuts are complete, turn the onion over and set on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Then use your fingers to gently spread apart the petals. If any of your cuts did not go all the way through, you can use a paring knife to be sure that the entire onion is cut into 16ths.In a separate small bowl, whisk together the Panko, Cajun seasoning and salt until combined.In a separate (additional) bowl, whisk the eggs until combined.Beginning with the lowest (bottom) layers of the onion, brush the top of each petal with the egg mixture until coated, then immediately sprinkle with the Panko mixture. Repeat until all petals are coated. (The panko won't totally \"stick\" when the egg is wet, but just press it on with your fingers.) It is kind of tedious, but worth it!Carefully form a tent with aluminum foil over the baking sheet until the onion is completely enclosed. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove tent and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the onion is soft and the tips are lightly crisped.Remove and serve with desired sauces.Whisk all ingredients together until combined. Serve immediately or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baked-blooming-onion-527279", "dishTypes": ["antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Crock Pot Ladies", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Crock-Pot-Posole-Soup-483768.png", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 480, "id": 483768, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Crock-Pot Posole Soup", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 170.39, "creditText": "Crock Pot Ladies", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper (or more if you like it spicy)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": ["( if you like it spicy)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "Teaspoons", "unitShort": "Teaspoon", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2031, "unit": "Teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 (4 Oz.)
