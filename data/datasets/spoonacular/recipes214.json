In the same processor bowl (no need to clean), in three batches, process the potatoes until very finely chopped. The pieces should be no bigger than a grain of rice and mostly smaller.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            As each batch of potatoes is processed, immediately scrape it into a strainer placed over a bowl. With a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon, press out the moisture. Immediately, stir the potatoes into the onion and egg mixture. Discard the liquid and potato starch that will settle in the bowl. Season the batter with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Pour 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or schmaltz into a 13 by 9-inch baking pan, preferably glass. Turn the pan to coat the bottom and half way up the sides with the oil or schmaltz. Place the empty pan in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.                                                                                                                             8                                                                            Remove the oiled pan from the oven and pour the potato batter into the pan. The oil will come up the sides of the pan, especially in the corners. Press the batter down near the corners to lightly to fill them with potato batter. It's a good thing when the oil comes over the top of the batter. It adds crispness. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil or melted schmaltz on the surface of the batter.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until lightly browned.                                                                                                                             10                                                                            Let rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving, preferably somewhat longer.

If you prefer thick Teriyaki Sauce, combine corn starch and water and whisk well in a small bowl.For Teriyaki sauce, bring the Teriyaki Sauce to a boil in a frying pan to evaporate alcohol (sake) for 15 seconds. If you prefer thin sauce, remove from heat and set aside.For thick sauce, stir in the corn starch mix to the sauce and whisk all together so that the corn starch mix will blend in with the sauce well. Remove from heat and set aside.Before cooking the meat, make sure the meat is at room temperature. In a cast iron skillet or a frying pan, heat oil on medium high heat. When the pan is hot, remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry with a paper towel before cooking to prevent steaming.Sear the meat for 2 minutes on one side, then 1.5 minutes on the other side.

With the mixer running- gradually add the sugar. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, pile about one-third of the egg whites into the yolk mixture. Gently fold them together until smooth. Add half of the flour and continue to gently fold, being careful to not deflate the egg whites. Repeat with another third of egg whites, the rest of the flour, and the last third of whites. Do not over-mix, but batter should be smooth, airy and fluffy.Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back when lightly touched or a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Run a knife around the edge of the cake pan, and invert the cake onto a wire rack. Peel off the parchment, then flip the cake right side up so it can cool.In a glass measuring cup or bowl, stir together the 3 milks and rum if using. When the cake has cooled for about 15-20 minutes. Use a fork to make holes all around the top of the cake for maximum milk-soakage. Place the cake on a large rimmed plate or cake stand. Pour the milk mixture over the cake slowly, letting it soak in before adding more. Make sure to get all around the edges and sides, spooning spilled-over milk back onto the top if necessary. You may not need all the milk, but continue to really drench the cake until you think it's evenly soaked. Chill in the fridge for minimum of one hour. Whip cream in a chilled bowl and fold in the powdered sugar. Spoon the cream over the chilled cake and top with cinnamon.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/tres-leches-cake-571145", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic":
