Thirty minutes before baking, remove the berries from the freezer and set aside, and remove the baking dish from the refrigerator. Bake the French toast, covered, at 350\u00b0 for 30 minutes.                                                                                            In a small bowl, cut butter into brown sugar until crumbly. Sprinkle berries and brown sugar mixture over French toast. Bake, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.                                        Yield: 8 servings.

Keep refrigerated until needed.For the burgers: Cook the bacon three-quarters of the way, remove from the pan and place on paper towels to drain any excess grease. When cool, cut into small pieces and set aside.Remove the stems from the peppers and halve them lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds (or leave them in if you like it HOT!) and finely dice. Set aside.Place the ground beef in a large mixing bowl. Add the diced bacon, peppers and the cheese. Mix together by hand just until incorporated. Don't overwork the burger mixture, as it will make the burgers tough.Shape the burgers into five 8-ounce patties. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Set the grill to high and cook the patties for 3 minutes on the first side, and then flip. Cook another 4 minutes for medium rare, or longer for desired temperature. Split the buns and brush with the oil. Toast the buns on the grill.Place some lettuce and tomato slices on the bottom half of the burger bun. Place the burger on top of the lettuce and tomatoes, then top the burger with a good amount of the cheese spread. Finish with the other half of the bun and serve with French fries.                                                            Cook's Notes: Wear a pair of gloves when cutting the habaneros. Pepper oil on your fingers really burns when you touch your eye.Placing the lettuce and tomato slices on the bottom bun will soak up some of the burger juice and keep the bun from getting soggy.This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe.

In a large, microwave-safe mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup peanut butter, oil, and heat on high power for about 30 seconds, just long enough to nicely soften peanut butter so it can be whisked together easily with the oil. Whisk until smooth and combined. Add the egg, yogurt, sugar, vanilla, and whisk until smooth. Add the mashed banana and stir to combine; batter will be lumpy because of the bananas. Add the flour, baking powder, optional salt, and stir until just combined; don't overmix. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula; set aside. To a mixing bowl (the same one used for the cake batter is fine, no need to wash it provided you scraped it fairly well with a spatula) add 1/4 cup peanut butter and heat on high power to melt it, about 30 seconds. Drizzle peanut butter over cake and lightly swirl it in with a knife, going up and back in a zigzag pattern. Don't get too carried away with swirling or peanut butter will sink into the cake while baking and won't be visible. Evenly sprinkle the chocolate over the pan. Bake for about 30 minutes,\u00a0or until done. The top will be domed and golden, the center set, and a toothpick inserted should come out mostly clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. At any point if your cake is getting a bit too golden or dark before the center is setting, tent with foil (lay a sheet of foil over the top of your cake; I didn't need to, but ovens and ingredients vary). Baking times could vary from 25 to 40 minutes based on water content of the bananas, yogurt, climate, and oven variances; bake until done. Watch your cake, not the clock.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-chunk-banana-cake-519920", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Two Peas and Their Pod", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cucumber-Feta-Salad-548498.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 548498, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Cucumber Feta Salad", "pricePerServing": 92.69, "creditText": "Two Peas and Their Pod", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 English cucumber, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "english cucumber", "metaInformation": ["english", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10111205, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup feta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1019, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh dill", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2045, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["red", "small", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon white vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "white vinegar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2053, "unit": "tablespoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 57.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/cucumber-feta-salad/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a small bowl, combine the cucumber slices, red onion slices, vinegar, sugar, and salt.
