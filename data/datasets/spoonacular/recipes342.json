Stir in the hot walnuts and pumpkin seeds. Add the pumpkin puree, water, maple syrup and sunflower oil and stir well with a sturdy wooden spoon or your hands to make sure the \"dough\" is moistened throughout and evenly distributed.Line a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan on all sides with parchment paper and scrape the dough into the prepared pan, packing it in and rounding it slightly on top; it won't rise in the oven. Cover tightly with a piece of plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 2-8 hours.When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400F. Bake the loaf for 1 hour and 15 minutes; it will be deeply bronzed on top and feel firm to the touch. Let cool completely, at least 2 hours. The bread is best sliced fairly thinly and toasted well. It will keep, refrigerated airtight, for up to 2 weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/alannas-pumpkin-cranberry-nut-seed-loaf-823914", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main

Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Add the fluff and salt and reduce the speed to low. Add the milk and vanilla mixture, scrape the bowl down, and mix until fully incorporated. Raise the mixer to high and beat briefly until fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Frost cupcake immediately.Yield: 3 3/4 cupsCopyright 2009 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved                                                Coconut Easter Grass for Cupcakes:                                        Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available.Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly.  If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer.Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days.Cook's Note:  Food coloring can be messy and can stain your skin. To prevent this, wear latex gloves. You may find it easier to color the coconut in a large zip top plastic bag, tossing it to color evenly.Yield:  2 cups coconut grassClick here for the next cupcake.
