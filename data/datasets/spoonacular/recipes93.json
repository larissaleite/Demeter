Shake vigorously to combine. Strain into 4 tall shot glasses.Mix the sugar and salt together onto a small plate. Dip each lime slice into the sugar mixture, shaking off any excess. Place a slice of lime on top of each of the shot glasses, then place a sugar cube on top of each lime. Pour a dash of the rum over each sugar cube. Using a long match or fire starter, ignite the sugar cubes, and when the sugar begins to caramelize, blow out the flame. Fold the lime slice and drop it into the shot with the sugar cube, and serve immediately.

Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cover. Simmer until the quinoa is mostly cooked through but still on the undercooked side, 15-20 minutes. The water will have absorbed but the quinoa won't quite be translucent. Meanwhile, set a small saucepan over medium heat and add the rice vinegar, honey and salt. Bring just to a simmer and keep warm until the quinoa is ready. Pour the vinegar mixture into the pan with the quinoa, stir well, cover and let sit until the quinoa absorbs the liquid. Remove the quinoa from the heat and let it cool completely.While the quinoa cools, mix together the Miso-Sesame Dipping Sauce. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Taste and add additional honey if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.To assemble the sushi rolls, lay the bamboo mat on a flat surface and spread a piece of plastic wrap over the top. Lay one sheet of Nori on top of the plastic wrap. Spread 1/3 of the quinoa on top of the Nori, leaving a slight border at the edges. In the center of the quinoa, arrange 1/3 of the filling ingredients starting with the avocado, followed by cucumber, then the beets, and ending with the sprouts or microgreens.To roll, start with the end closest to you. Using the bamboo mat for help, bring the end up and tightly roll over the filling, pressing as you go. Press the edges together to seal.

Using a medium cookie scoop (or use your hands and roll the dough into tightly packed balls), form mounds weighing 1.40 to 1.50 ounces each, about two heaping tablespoons each; I made 20 cookies. The mounds will look large because the caramel corn bulks the dough without adding much mass so they look bigger raw than they bake into.It\u2019ll seem that there are more add-ins than dough, and that there\u2019s no way all this caramel corn and chocolate chips will stay bound together with this paltry amount of dough, but they do. Using your hands as necessary, press all the caramel corn and chocolate chips in, and firmly squeeze the mounds of dough, or roll them between your hands as necessary to get everything to stick together. Slightly flatten the mounds so they don\u2019t stay too domed and puffed while baking, just don\u2019t over-flatten.The dough must be chilled before baking, so place mounds on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future as desired.Preheat oven to 350F, line two baking sheets with Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats, place dough on trays spaced 2 inches apart, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until edges are set and tops are barely set. Even if they\u2019re pale, glossy, and slightly under-baked in the center, this is okay and they\u2019ll firm up as they cool. Watch them closely after 7 minutes, and I recommend the lower end of the baking range, and not exceeding 10 minutes.Baking too long results in cookies that become too crisp and hard, with caramel corn and undersides that will become too browned. The cookies shown in the photos were baked for 8 to 9 minutes depending on the batch (I preferred the 8 minute cookies), with trays rotated halfway through baking. They were quite glossy and\u00a0translucent at 8 to 9 minutes, but I pulled them out anyway and as they cooled, the warm dough shrank down and clung tightly to chunks of caramel corn.I brought the cookies to my daughter\u2019s birthday party and men, women, toddlers, teenagers, and strangers from a neighboring party in the park came over to our table requesting cookies. Word got out in the park about them and they were a hot item, even seeming to trump the birthday cakes from either party. Although I made a strawberry cake with strawberry frosting and sprinkles per my princess\u2019 request that wasn\u2019t too shabby.People would take a bite of a cookie, lock eyes with someone else who was eating one, and were proclaiming things like ohmygodthesearesogood. I love bringing food to parties and watching people\u2019s honest reactions when they don\u2019t know who made what and I observe those reactions like a fly on the wall.They\u2019re sweet with a little bit of saltiness from the caramel corn, although not a true sweet-and-salty treat. But you can make them that way with a finishing sprinkle of coarse sea salt. As it bakes, the caramel corn turns from crunchy and crisp into soft and chewy. The caramel sauce that coats the corn melts off a bit, creating puddles of caramel amidst chocolate.The idea of stuffing as much chocolate as possible into cookie dough is something I did with the New York Times Chocolate Chips Cookies and repeated it here. Chocolate oozes everywhere and is a rich, dark, flood that blankets the pieces of caramel corn and contrasts beautifully against the buttery, vanilla-twinged dough.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

"1 Prepare the teriyaki sauce: Combine the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of the water, mirin, honey, minced garlic and grated ginger in a saucepan.Bring everything to boil over medium heat. Dissolve the cornstarch with the remaining tablespoon of water and add to the teriyaki sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low, and let the sauce simmer until it starts to thicken, about 30 seconds to a minute.Turn off the heat and allow the sauce to cool. The sauce will thicken a little more as it cools. You should have about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sauce.2 Cook the chicken: Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saut pan over high heat. Add half of the diced red onions and cook until they start to soften, about 2 minutes. Add ground chicken and a pinch of kosher salt. Using your spatula, break up chicken into smaller pieces. Stir occasionally until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate.3 Cook the vegetables: Quickly wipe down the pan and heat another tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the remaining diced red onions and cook until they soften, about 2 minutes. Add the zucchini and red pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers start to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir the sliced scallions and cooked chicken into the pan with cooked vegetables. 4 Coat with the teriyaki sauce: Drizzle 6 tablespoons of the prepared teriyaki sauce and  teaspoon sesame oil into the pan and stir. Save the rest of the teriyaki sauce for drizzling over wraps. Turn off heat, taste, and adjust seasonings if needed.5 To serve, place several spoonfuls of filling onto a lettuce leaf. Top with chopped peanuts, cilantro, scallions, and an extra drizzle of teriyaki sauce, if desired.

"aggregateLikes": 1657, "instructions": "For the gravy: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the sorghum flour (it will form a chunky paste, but that's normal). In a small bowl, whisk the broth, miso, and potato starch until completely smooth. Pour it into the saucepan and increase heat to medium-high, whisking vigorously until smooth and no lumps remain. Whisk in coconut aminos, salt, and pepper, to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low to avoid burning. Once thickened, remove from heat until ready to use (you can quickly reheat before serving). You can always add a bit more broth if it's too thick for your liking.For the sweet potatoes: Preheat oven to 375F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice a large sweet potato into 1-cm rounds. Place on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss to coat and spread out into an even layer. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-35 minutes, until tender and lightly golden in some spots, flipping once half way through roasting.For the quinoa: Add 1 cup of quinoa into a pot with 1.5 cups of vegetable broth or water. Bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 13-16 minutes, until the water absorbs and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat, season with salt, and keep lid on until ready to consume.For the mushrooms: Remove stems from Portobello mushrooms by twisting them off. Discard stems or save for future use. With a small spoon, scoop out the black gills and discard. With a damp cloth, wipe the cap to remove any debris. Slice into long, 1/2-inch wide strips. In a large wok or saucepan, whisk together the vinegar, garlic, and coconut aminos. Add sliced mushrooms and toss until coated in the liquid. Turn heat to medium-high and cook down the mushrooms for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently and reducing heat when necessary. You want to cook the mushrooms until all the water cooks off the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.To assemble: Add a couple scoops of cooked quinoa into a bowl. Layer on roasted sweet potato rounds. Top with mushrooms and drizzle on gravy. Season with a herbed salt (such as Herbamare) and black pepper to finish.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chickpea-miso-gravy-bowl-with-sweet-and-tangy-portobello-mushrooms-621882",

a food processor until partly smooth but not completely pureed. It should have a little texture. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble dumplings: Hold a wonton wrapper in your hand. Dip a spoon in cold water and then drop 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of a wrapper (dipping the spoon in cold water first will make the filling come off easier). Gather the edges of the wrapper up around the filling and squeeze the sides slightly with your fingers. The sides will naturally pleat, leaving the filling slightly exposed. Tap the dumpling on the table so the bottom is flat and it stands upright. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. (You can freeze the leftover filling for 2 or 3 weeks.)Lightly oil the bottom of a 10-inch bamboo steamer and line it with the whole cabbage leaves. Stand the dumplings in the steamer in a single layer and don't let them touch. You should be able to get 12 siu mai in the steamer at a time. Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a pot. Set the bamboo steamer over the pot, then cover it with the bamboo lid. Steam for 10 to 12 minutes or until the filling feels firm and is cooked through. Serve in the steamer basket and garnish with micro arugula and soy sauce.
