                                                         Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Peel and cut the squash up into 1-inch wedges, discarding the peel and seeds. Peel and core the fennel and chop it up into equally-sized wedges. Roast, drizzled with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, until soft and caramelized, about 35 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In the meantime, toast the fennel seeds in a dry skillet until fragrant, then grind or pulverize in a mortar and pestle. Heat the butter over medium-high heat in a heavy, large pot (like a Dutch oven) until it foams, then add the seeds, onion, thyme, chiles, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            While the squash and fennel finish roasting, prepare the pumpkin seeds: melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat, then add the seeds, sugar, spices, and a pinch of salt. Toss well to coat the seeds and cook until they begin to pop and color slightly, moving them around the pan often. Remove from the heat, wait 30 seconds, then add the honey and toss quickly to coat. Spread on a plate to cool.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Combine the contents of the roasting pan with the onion in the heavy pot, and pour in the sherry. Allow to reduce for a few minutes, then add the water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes. Transfer about a third of the solids to a blender (pur\u00e9e it in batches to ensure the perfect consistency) and add 1/2 cup or so of the liquid. Turn on at low speed until the solid are completely pur\u00e9ed, then add another 1/2 cup broth and turn the speed to high, adding liquid little by little until the soup has the consistency of heavy cream. Blend for at least a full minute on high speed.  Follow this process for the rest of the soup.                                                                                                                            5

Season with salt, pepper.Wash and completely dry the salmon fillets.Heat the remaining teaspoon of vegetable oil in the large reserved   cast iron or non-stick skillet set over medium heat. When the oil is   very hot; add the salmon, skin side  down. Cook it until the skin is   very crisp, dark brown and releases  easily from the pan. This should   take 3 to 4 minutes. Do not be tempted  to check or move the fish around   in the pan during this time. You will  only succeed in making it stick   to the pan or worse ruin your  beautifully crisp skin.Once the skin has crisped flip the fish, and cook  it an additional 1   to 2 minutes more, until the flesh is nearly (but not quite) opaque in   the center. Do not let it cook all the  way through. The fish will   continue to cook after it leaves the pan.  Your goal is a succulent   flesh graduating from a medium rare center outwards to  a crispy crackly   skin.Place the seared fillets on plates, skin side down. Spoon pesto over.

If you have a baking stone, place that in the center rack to bake on. Butter two 8\" cake pans, line bottoms with parchment paper, butter parchment, then\u00a0dust with flour and tap out excess.Spread pecans in a sheet pan and bake in oven for 10 minutes or until gently toasted. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.In a mixer, combine cake flour, baking powder, and sea salt and mix on low for 30 seconds. Set aside. Do not clean bowl.In mixer, beat butter on medium speed until light and fluffy - at least 4 minutes *see note 1. Add in sugar and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.On low speed, beat in egg yolks and whole eggs one at a time until just blended. On low speed, beat in canola oil.On the lowest speed, stir in flour mix until just blended.Mash bananas well, then mix bananas and pecans into batter.Divide batter between the two 8\" pans, place on a sheet pan and put in the oven, or if using a baking stone , slide directly onto the baking stone in the oven.Bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the middle of each of the pans. The kitchen will noticeably smell of the banana cake as it nears completion. Set aside to cool completely before frosting.Butterscotch Sauce DirectionsIn a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over low-medium heat. Just before butter is completely melted, add the brown sugar, stirring to completely moisten the sugar.Gently cook, stirring occasionally,\u00a0until the mixture caramelizes and transforms from its initial graininess to a smooth \u201cmolten lava\u201d. \u00a0Make sure to get the corners of the pot and watch closely because the texture will change quickly, 3-5 min.Whisk in all of the cream at once, lower the heat a little, and continue whisking until the the liquid is homogenous. Turn heat back up to medium and cook for another 7 minutes, whisking every few minutes.Turn off the heat and let cool for 15 minutes. Add half of vanilla extract, Scotch, and sea salt, then taste for flavor. \u00a0Add more of each until the flavor is perfect to your palate. Pour into a sealable container and allow to cool fully. Store covered and refrigerated for up to a month.Cream Cheese Frosting DirectionsIn a mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add cream cheese and beat until light and fluffy.Stir in confectioners sugar, vanilla extract, and bitters then slowly increase speed and beat until incorporated. Set aside until ready to frost cake.Banana Cake AssemblyIn a large skillet heat additional 3 T of butter over medium heat. Add sliced bananas and cook until slices start to brown, 1-2 minutes. Carefully turn over bananas and cook other side until browned, 1-2 minutes.If butterscotch has thickened too much to pour, gently heat until it becomes pourable. Set aside.Remove banana cakes from pans, peel off parchment, and trim the tops with a serrated knife to give them flat top surface.Put a dab of frosting in the middle of a cake circle or plate (the frosting helps keep the cake from sliding around). Place the first cake layer on a cake circle or plate. Line several strips of wax paper around base of cake to help keep circle or plate clean.Put about 3/4 cup of frosting in the middle of the cake and spread the frosting working from the center out, leaving a slight built up edge on the outer rim. When finished, you should have nice thin layer of frosting over most of the top surface of the cake, with a 1/2\" little wall on the outer rim that will help hold in the butterscotch.Arrange browned banana slices on bottom layer of cake, keeping within the frosting rim. Pour butterscotch over banana slices (you'll only use about half of the butterscotch).Take second cake and frost a thin layer \u00a0on the cut top to seal crumb and keep butterscotch from soaking into cake. Carefully turn over cake and set on top of bananas, frosted side down.Spread frosting over entire cake, swirling to completely cover. Remove strips of wax paper at base of cakes. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days.

honey, mustard, oregano and garlic in a bowl. Slowly stream in the olive oil while whisking. Add salt and pepper to taste. Measure out 1/2 cup of the dressing for marinating the chicken. Set aside the remaining dressing for drizzling on the salad.For the chicken: Put the chicken in a nonreactive container, pour the reserved 1/2 cup sweet Greek dressing over it and toss to coat. Marinate the chicken, refrigerated, for 2 hours.Preheat a grill to medium heat.Oil the grill grates with vegetable oil. Grill the chicken until golden on each side and the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F, 7 to 8 minutes per side. Let rest before slicing.For the salad: Brush each romaine half with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on high on the cut sides until slightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes.Place a seared romaine half on a serving plate. Line up some tomatoes, feta, olives, cucumbers, onions and sliced chicken atop the romaine. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Drizzle with the sweet Greek dressing. Garnish with cracked black pepper and sea salt and serve.

I like to break up the ground meat as I add it to the bowl to make it easier to combine well.  Use your clean fingertips to mix everything, just until well combined.Use a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop to form balls about 1\" in diameter.  Roll them in your hands until round, and then set on a plate.  Coat the bottom of a skillet with olive oil and heat until hot.  Brown the meatballs on all sides.  Add the bourbon cranberry sauce to the skillet, and stir to cover the meatballs.  Add a little bit of water if the sauce seems too thick. Cook, covered, for about 10 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through, they should read about 160F on an instant read thermometer inserted in the center.

Snip off the hard stems of the figs with scissors or a small knife and coarsely chop the figs. In a medium bowl, combine the figs, raisins, cherries, apricots, honey, sherry, lemon juice, pecans, and a pinch of salt. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight at room temperature.In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, cloves, superfine sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the egg and mix until incorporated. With the mixer still on low, slowly add the flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt just until combined. Don't over mix! Add the fruits and nuts, including any liquid in the bowl. Divide the dough in half and place each half on the long edge of a 12 by 18-inch piece of parchment or waxed paper. Roll each half into a log, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4-inch thick, making an 18-inch-long roll. Refrigerate the dough for several hours, or until firm. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.With a small, sharp knife, cut the logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the slices 1/2-inch apart on ungreased sheet pans and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly golden.

Place the florets into a large pot with a few inches of water on the bottom. Cover and bring to a boil.

Pierce a few times with a fork and then microwave for about 3-5 minutes or until you can easily pierce with a fork. NOTE: I decided to keep the skin on, but feel free to peel the skin before microwaving. Drain cauliflower from as much water as possible and transfer the into a large food processor. Cut sweet potato in half and then in half again and place in food processor as well. Add in about 1/2 cup of almond milk, salt and pepper to taste, and butter, and process until combined. You may need to stop a few times to scrape the sides. It should be very similar to mashed potato consistency. Place in a large tupperware or bowl and into the refrigerator to let cool.  Once cooled, prepare your cakes by adding in an egg, cheddar cheese, chives, and oat flour. This should thicken up the consistency of the mash a little bit. Using a 1/4 cup scooper, create a ball in your hand and then mash into a cake.Heat a nonstick pan to medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place cakes onto pan (I did three at a time) and let cook for about 2 minutes or until golden brown, covered. Flip cakes and let cook for an additional 2 minutes, covered.

Break up any large pieces of blue cheese, cover and refrigerate until ready you dip.FOR THE SPICY GARLIC WINGS:Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.Working in batches if needed, line up the chicken pieces and drizzle with a little olive oil {not a lot!}. Place pan 5 inches underneath the broiler, flipping every 5 minutes until the chicken is cooked and the skin is golden and crispy, about 25 minutes.Meanwhile prepare the wing sauce. In a sauce pan combine the Frank's, sugar, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Stir while it is brought up to a simmer for 5-10 minutes then remove off the heat.In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolk, water and cornstarch. Grab a small measuring cup of the hot sauce and while whisking, slowly stream it into bowl with the egg/cornstarch. Once combined, gradually add in the rest of the sauce.Add cooked wings into the spicy garlic sauce and toss to coat. Serve with the blue cheese dip and enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/spicy-garlic-chicken-wings-+-the-best-blue-cheese-dip-577149", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
