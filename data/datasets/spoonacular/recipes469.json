Flatten the dough with your hands and roll out into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. As you roll out the dough, use enough flour to prevent it from sticking to the work surface but not so much as to make the dough dry.8. Sprinkle seeds and cranberries over the dough and roll the dough up to encase them. Fold the dough over again to work the seeds into the dough.9. Using a small amount of flour, form the dough into a loaf shape. Place the loaf in the prepared pan and allow to rest and rise for 2 hours (or just 40 minutes if you're using fresh, unrefrigerated dough).10. Twenty minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F., and place an empty broiler tray on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread.11. Just before putting bread in the oven, brush the loaf with egg wash (I sprinkled additional pepitas on top too), and place it on a rack near the center of the oven. Pour 1 cup of hot tap water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door. Bake the loaf for 45 to 50 minutes, until deeply browned and firm.12.
