Line a standard muffin tin with paper liners. Place chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over (not in) a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally just until melted, 4 to 5 minutes.Remove bowl from heat. Whisk in sugar and salt until mixture is smooth; whisk in eggs to combine. Gently whisk in flour and cocoa just until smooth (do not over mix). Fill each cupcake to about  full with batter. Bake, rotating halfway through, until a toothpick inserted halfway in centers comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached, about 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for a10 minutes, then remove cupcakes and allow to cool completely on the rack. Cupcakes can be stored up to 3 days at room temperature in airtight containers.Using the whisk attachment on the mixer, beat butter until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, sift together powdered sugar and cocoa. Whisk together to combine. Whisk in sugar mixture with butter, alternating with milk, beating well after each addition. Beat until smooth. Blend in vanilla. Butttercream will be light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag.In a small bowl, whisk together  cup powdered sugar and milk; add milk a  teaspoon at a time until a glue like consistency is reached. Add more powdered sugar if needed to thicken the glaze. Place 2 tablespoons of the white glaze in a small plastic bag or bottle to use for writing on the tombstones and set aside.In the remaining glaze, add a small amount of black food coloring to color the tombstones gray. Cover with plastic wrap if not using immediately. Dip the halved cookie into the gray glaze, scraping off excess glaze. Allow glazed tombstones to fully dry on a sheet pan.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.Place paper liners into 2 (12-cup) muffin tins and set aside. If you prefer, set 12 ovenproof coffee mugs on a half sheet pan and set aside.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.Place the hot water and the cocoa powder into a small bowl and whisk to thoroughly combine. Set aside. Place the egg yolks and 5 ounces of the sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk on high for 2 minutes or until the mixture becomes pale yellow and 'ribbons' when lifted. Add the cocoa mixture, vegetable oil and vanilla and whisk to combine. Add the dry ingredients and whisk just to combine. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl while you whisk the egg whites.Place the egg whites and cream of tartar into a clean bowl and whisk on high using the whisk attachment, until it becomes foamy. Decrease the speed to low and gradually add the remaining ounce of sugar. Once the sugar has all been added, increase the speed back to high and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, approximately 2 minutes.Transfer 1/3 of the egg whites to the batter and whisk until well combined. Add the remaining egg whites and fold in gently. Transfer batter into prepared muffin tins or coffee mugs, evenly dividing the batter between the cups. Place both muffin tins on the middle rack of the oven or, if using mugs, place all of them on a half sheet pan and set on the bottom rack of the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean or the cupcakes reach an internal temperature of 205 to 210 degrees F. Remove from the oven to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely before frosting.
