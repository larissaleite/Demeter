If you are using a chocolate bar, you can use a grater. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine eggs with honey. Blend them together, until they turn into a foamy mixture and triple in volume.In a separate bowl, combine together flour, baking soda and cacao; set aside.Fold in oil, chocolate into the egg mixture, stir until combined. In small portions, fold in flour mixture into the eggs. Mix until ingredients are well combined together. Divide dough into eight equal pieces or you can weigh each piece individually. This way they will all turn out the same size.Here is the trick to rolling it out easy. Flour surface generously; this will help you work with the dough easier, since the dough is sticky. To move it onto the baking sheet, roll it up onto the roller, and unroll it onto the baking sheet. Make sure it measures out to be large enough to fit the shape you will cut out later. Bake at 350F for 5-7 minutes, until browned. During the process of baking, roll out another layer to speed up the process. When it's done, remove it from the oven and cut out each circle by placing a plate over the top. The key trick to making all of the sides perfect, is to cut the cake right after baking. You'll need the excess pieces (sides you have left over) to use for later decoration.In a mixer bowl, combine together condensed milk, Irish cream and cold heavy whipping cream.

Stir with a wooden spoon or mix on low speed with a dough hook until you form a ball, Then work in the other \u00bd cup flour to stiffen the dough (you may not need all the flour).Then knead for 10 minutes (or about 6 minutes by mixer). Add the Asiago cheese during the last minute of kneading (I kneaded the cheese in by hand to ensure it was even.) The dough should be firm and thoroughly mixed. If it is dry, add a but more water, and if it is sticky, add a bit more flour.Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces and roll into balls. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and let them to rest for 20 minutes.Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. To shape the bagels, push a roll through the center and stretch out the hole to 2\u00bd inches in diameter. Put the bagels on the pan and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Let sit for 20 minutes.To test the bagels to see if they are ready to retard in the refrigerator, your bagels need to pass the float test. Basically, fill a bowl with room temperature water. If your bagels float within 10 seconds of being dropped in the water it is ready! Pat it dry, cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. If it doesn\u2019t float, return the bagel to the pan and let it proof more. Check again every 10 minutes until the bagel floats.The next day, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the one rack set in the middle of the oven.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda. Drop the bagels into the water, boiling only as many as will fit. After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute.
