Melt the butter in an oven safe 12-inch stainless steel skillet set over medium-low heat. Add the grapes and toss until coated in the butter. Transfer the skillet to the oven. Cook, stirring every five minutes or so, until grapes have burst and there is a decent amount of liquid, about 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer. Add the sausages and poach until a meat thermometer measures 140\u00b0F, about 10 minutes. Remove sausages from the liquid and set aside.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            When grapes are done, carefully remove the skillet and set it on a burner. Turn off the oven. Wrap the buns in aluminum foil and add to the oven, so that they can warm from the residual heat. Using a strainer, remove the grapes and set aside in a bowl, leaving as much of the liquid behind as possible. Add vinegar to the skillet. Stir with a wooden spoon and simmer over medium heat until the liquid reduces by half and becomes lightly syrupy, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Brush a grill pan with canola oil and heat over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add the sausages and cook until browned on both sides, one to two minutes per side. Set aside.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Remove the buns from the oven, discard the aluminum foil, and set each on a different plate. Top each bun with a grilled sausage, a few spoonfuls of the roasted grapes, a drizzle of the reduced grape glaze, and 1/2 ounce crumbled cheese.

Put oil, garlic and red pepper flakes into a large, nonreactive pot. Turn the heat to medium. Keep watch. As soon as the garlic starts to sizzle, stir it around for 20-30 seconds, but don't let it brown. Pour in the tomatoes and salt. Stir to combine. As soon as everything starts to bubble, turn the heat down to a simmer. Cook the sauce for 20 minutes, uncovered. If you like your sauce chunky, use the back of a wooden spook to break up the tomatoes. If you like your sauce smooth, puree in a food processor or use an immersion blender to puree the sauce in the pot. Just before using, stir in slivered basil.Pound the chicken While the sauce is simmering, pound the chicken breast halves by putting one half breast into a large ziplock baggie. Using a meat mallet or a heavy rolling pin, pound the breast gently and evenly12-20 times, starting at the middle and working towards the edges, until you get an even thickness of about \u00bd to1/4 inch. Repeat with the remaining chicken.Bread the Chicken: Set out a large plate and pour the flour onto it. Next to that put the eggs into a wide shallow bowl and whisk them. Next to the eggs put a large plate with the breadcrumbs on it. Season the chicken breasts with salt, to taste, on both sides. Then dredge with flour. Shake off the excess. Then dip the breast into the egg and coat both sides, allowing the excess to drip off. Then press the breast into the crumbs to coat both sides. Put the breaded chicken onto a plate and set aside while you repeat the process with the rest of the chicken.Brown the chicken: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Place two of the chicken breast in the pan and cook for one to two minutes per side, just until you get a nice golden brown crust. You may need to add a bit more oil, if the pan seems too dry when you flip the chicken over. Remove the scallops to a plate. Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the pan and brown the other two scallops.Assemble the chicken parmesan Spread about a cup of sauce over the bottom of a large casserole or baking pan. Arrange the browned chicken cutlets on top. Pour 2 cups of sauce evenly over the cutlets. Sprinkle \u00bd cup parmesan evenly over the top. Then add the mozzarella cheese.

Let sit for 10 minutes and allow the yeast to proof, it will foam up. Once the yeast is ready add the eggs, salt, heavy cream and melted butter.Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and mix on medium until combined. Continue adding the remaining 1/2 cup of flour slowly until it\u2019s all incorporated. Dough will be sticky. At this point begin adding a tablespoon of flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a smooth ball (about 4-6 minutes). If you don\u2019t have a mixer or would rather knead the dough with you hands, place the dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth, adding a little more flour as needed (about 8-10 minutes). The dough may still be a bit sticky, but shouldn\u2019t be overly so.Spray a bowl with cooking spray and place the dough inside, cover with some plastic wrap on top. Let rise for 2 hours in a warm spot. I like to turn my oven on to the lowest temperature for about a minute and then immediately turn it off again. Then I place the bowl in the warm oven.When the dough is ready place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out into a square or rectangle. Roll to 1/4 inch thick. Use a pizza cutter, knife or pastry cutter to cut into 3\u00d73 inch squares (about 25 squares).Place a deep, heavy bottom pot on the stove and add enough oil to fill the pot about 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep. Turn the burner to medium and preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. I would recommend using an instant read thermometer so you know the exact temperature at all times. Once the oil is ready, fry 4-6 at time depending on the size of your pot. Use the slotted spoon to flip them over every 30 seconds. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. If they are taking longer than 3 minutes to brown you need to turn your burner up and make sure your oil is at the correct temperature. Remove with slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining squares. Dust the warm beignets with powdered sugar on both sides. To assemble the tiramisu, combine the mascarpone, powdered sugar, kahlua and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.Add the heavy cream to a separate bowl and beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture, set aside.To make the ganache, in a microwave safe bowl add the chocolate and coconut milk (or heavy cream). Microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring between each until melted. Once melted stir in the vanilla extract. Add the coffee to a shallow bowl and dip about 18-20 of the beignets in the coffee, submerging them completely and then allow any excess coffee to drip back into the bowl. Chop the beignets into bite size squares.To assemble add a layer of coffee dipped beignets to the bottom of your serving glasses. Spread a layer of the mascarpone over the beignets and then a layer of the ganache. Sprinkle on the chopped chocolate. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients have been used (I got three layers for an 8 ounce glass). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Garnish each individual tiramisu with a dollop of coconut whipped cream and a beignet. Serve!To make this in a 9x13 inch baking dish, arrange the half the beignets a single layer on the bottom of the dish. Spread one-third of the mascarpone mixture over the beignets and spread half the ganache over top that. Add the remaining beignets and arrange on top. Spread the remaining mascarpone mixture on top and the remaining ganache. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.
