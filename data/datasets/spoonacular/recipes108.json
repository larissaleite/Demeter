Toast the cumin, coriander, and celery seeds in a nonstick skillet until aromatic. Cool, and then grind in a spice grinder until fine.2. Combine all of the gazpacho ingredients except for the Tabasco, salt, and pepper in a bowl and marinate overnight.3. Pure in a food processor and strain out pulp. Season with Tabasco, salt, and pepper; refrigerate.Make the ratatouille4. Heat oil in a 10-inch saute pan. In small batches, saute vegetables until slightly brown and crispy. Remove and place into a mixing bowl. Season with garlic, salt, and pepper to taste.5. Bind with tomato sauce and basil. Heat oven to 350F (175C). Cut the corn tortilla into 1/4-inch strips. Place on a baking sheet and top with another. Crisp for about 10 minutes; cool.6. Fill a large wine glass about one-third to one-half full (depending on the size of the glass) with the yellow gazpacho and float a teaspoon of ratatouille in the center with the scallion julienne.7.

Cut into uniformed sized pieces (about 1\" cubes) and add them to the bottom of a large pot. Cover potatoes with cold water and salt the water with 2-3 teaspoons of salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until fork tender (a fork should pierce them easily). Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain potatoes and them place into a large bowl. Add butter and beat with a hand mixer until potatoes are nice and crumbled. Add milk and sour cream and continue to mix until smooth, adding salt and pepper to taste. Make sure you salt them well - there is nothing worse than bland potatoes! Set aside until ready to use.For the Shepherd's Pie:Preheat oven at 400 degrees F. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots, celery and garlic and saute until softened (about 5 to 8 minutes). Season with salt and pepper. Once the vegetables begin to brown a little bit, add the tomato paste and mix until well incorporated. Add the ground beef and cook until beef is cooked completeley (it will no longer be pink), about 8-10 minutes. Add the frozen peas and carrots, beef stock, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Reduce heat to low and simmer meat mixture for another 10-12 minutes. Transfer mixture to an oven-safe baking dish and spread into one even layer. Spread potatos in and even layer on top of ground beef mixture. You have 2 options here:1. Top with shredded cheese and bake until melted (about 5 minutes). - This was our obvious choice ;)2. Skip the cheese and rake through the potatoes with a fork to form peaks (helps them brown well), place into the preheated oven and bake until potatoes are browned (about 20 minutes).

You want to maintain a bit of texture.Transfer to a mixing bowl and add nut meal (or oat flour) and mix again until a loose dough is formed that's firm enough to be handled. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a touch more salt.Draw an x in the dough to form 4 sections, then use your hands to form into 4 large patties roughly 1/2-inch thick.Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze for 15 minutes to firm up. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F in the meantime.OPTIONAL STEP: For a little extra crust on the outside, before baking heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive or canola oil. Swirl to coat pan, then add falafel. Carefully flip once golden brown  about 3-4 minutes - and then cook on the other side until golden brown as well - 3-4 more minutes. Return to baking sheet to continue baking. Otherwise, just add them straight to the oven for baking.Bake for a total of 30-40 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point for even cooking. The longer you bake them, the firmer theyll get!Serve warm wrapped in a pita or chard bun and desired sauces / toppings. Alternatively, serve atop a salad and use the garlic sauce as a dressing.Burgers will store in the fridge, layered with parchment paper in an airtight container, for several days.

When the butter has melted turn heat up to low-medium setting and add chopped onion and celery.  When the chopped onion begins to look translucent and the celery is tender add the 1 cup of flour.  This will look crumbly, and may appear you have too much flour.  Cook through for a couple of minutes, so the raw flour taste will be cooked out.  Add chicken stock a cup at a time, stirring until the mixture looks thick and gravy like.  Add the second and third cup of chicken stock stirring to incorporate each time.  This mixture will look like a thick gravy now.  Add 1/2 pint of heavy cream, and then stir until incorporated, then add remaining heavy cream and stir.  Add grated cheese by thirds into soup, stirring until all of the cheese is fully melted.  Add tobasco sauce, dry mustard, pepper, Worcester sauce, and stir until fully blended.  Slowly pour in beer stirring until well blended.

Place the bowl in a microwave on high heat for 30 seconds, remove the bowl, and stir the chocolates vigorously with a wooden spoon. Continue heating and stirring the chocolates in 30-second intervals, switching to 15-second intervals as the chocolates start to melt, continuing to stir vigorously with a wooden spoon in between each heating. Heat only until the chocolates are just melted. Add the remaining quarter of the chocolates and stir vigorously until melted and smooth. (If the chocolate isn't completely melted, microwave it for another 5 or 10 seconds.)Place the cornflakes in a medium bowl, pour the chocolate mixture over the cornflakes, and immediately fold them together with a rubber spatula, being careful not to break up the cornflakes. You'll want to work quickly so the chocolate doesn't harden. Fold in the cranberries.Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Working with 2 soup spoons, spoon 8 mounds of chocolate crisps onto the paper. Set aside at room temperature to cool completely until hardened. Peel the crisps off the paper and serve.                                                    \"Make It Ahead\" by Ina Garten (c) Clarkson Potter 2014. Provided courtesy of Ina Garten.

Add the tempeh bits and gently toss to completely coat with marinade. Let stand for 10 minutes or cover and chill overnight.Use a fork to transfer the tempeh pieces (leaving any marinade behind) to a lightly oiled cast-iron skillet preheated over medium heat. Lay the pieces in a single layer, and if desired spritz with a little cooking spray. Cook until well browned on one side, flip, and cook the other side until browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. After the tempeh is browned on both sides, pour the marinade over it and simmer until the marinade is absorbed. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. Store chilled and consume within 2 days for best flavour. For the saladStrip the kale leaves off the stems, tear or chop into bite-size pieces. Wash and spin the kale dry, then transfer the kale to a large mixing bowl. Whisk all of the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl.

In a large bowl, add the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, stirring to combine.In another large bowl, use a wooden spoon to mix 2 cups of the flour mixture with the remaining cup of water, butter, sugar, salt, and egg. Mix thoroughly, then add the yeast mixture. Continue to mix, adding the remaining flour a little bit at a time, until all the flour has been added and a dough forms that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface (I prefer to use all-purpose flour here instead of whole wheat) and knead it for 5-8 minutes, adding more flour as needed if the dough is sticking to your hands or the surface. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (this should take about 90 minutes).After the rise is complete, punch the dough down with your fist, then turn it out onto a work surface (no need to use flour here unless you encounter sticking). Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces, and roll each piece into a strand about 12 inches long. Squeeze the ends of the 3 strands together and tuck under. Braid the strands, and squeeze the opposite ends together and tuck under. (Don't stress about making it look perfect - the second rise is very forgiving, plus it's good for homemade bread to have a little character!)Gently transfer the braided loaf onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spray a sheet of plastic wrap with oil, then loosely set the plastic wrap over the loaf. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for an additional 60 minutes. When the dough is nearing the end of its 2nd rise, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Remove the plastic wrap, and mix the beaten egg together with the water to create the egg wash. Use a pastry brush to gently coat the top of the loaf with the mixture. If desired, sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. Bake for about 30 minutes until golden brown.

Stir to dissolve completely, then add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Remove the brine from the heat, and cool the brine down by transferring it to a bowl that can fit into another bowl filled with an ice bath. While the brine chills, you may trim any visible fat off the pork loin, if you wish. This is a matter of preference. Once the brine has chilled, add the pork loin to the brine and refrigerate for one hour.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, and set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.Remove the pork loin from the brine and discard the brining liquid. Dry the surface of the pork with a paper towel, then brush the entire surface with the dijon mustard. Use kitchen twine to pull together and tie the pork loin into as circular of a shape as possible. This will help the pork loin cook evenly (and also look nicer). Stir to combine both bread crumbs, the rosemary, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, and the olive oil. Press this mixture on the surface of the pork loin, all over the whole loin. Plop the pork loin on top of the wire rack and roast for approximately an hour, but you want to cook the pork loin until a thermometer inserted through the side into the center of the roast reads 138 degrees F. Remove the pork loin from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes (you may tent it with foil to keep it warm). The resting stage is very important because the residual heat in the pork will further cook it to approximately 145 degrees F, and the juices will be allowed to redistribute.

freezer to chill.Sprinkle the gelatin evenly over 1 cup cold water in a medium saucepan. Let sit until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Stir the mixture, and add the mint leaves and granulated sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring gently, until the sugar and gelatin are dissolved completely, about 5 minutes (don't let the mixture come to a boil). Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl placed over an ice bath, pressing the mint with the back of a spoon to extract all the juices. Stir in the bourbon, and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until the gelatin begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.Place sixteen 1-ounce disposable plastic or paper cups on a small rimmed sheet pan. Put 1 medium mint leaf into each glass. Divide the gelatin mixture evenly among the glasses, totally submerging the mint leaves (they will float to the top). Refrigerate the shots until completely set, about 3 hours. (These can be done a day ahead.)Pour the cream and confectioners' sugar into the chilled bowl. Beat the mixture with a large whisk until medium peaks form. Gently fold in the liqueur with a rubber spatula. (This step can be done a day ahead; refrigerate the whipped cream in an airtight container.) Serve the shots cold, topped with whipped cream.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.
