If you don't have a rolling pin just stretch it and press with your hands. This dough is really easy to work with.Scatter the blackberry filling evenly across the dough. Roll it up lengthwise (refer to blog post photos for visual aids) and cut into 12 pieces. Lay the pieces in the prepared baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and let them rise for another 1\u00bd hours.Pre-heat the oven to 350.Bake the risen rolls for 25-30 minutes. They will be golden and pretty.While the buns bake, mix all the ingredients for the glaze until smooth.When you take the buns from the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before inverting them into a wire rack. Flip them back over and frost them with the glaze.Serve warm.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blackberry-sticky-buns-517780", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic":
