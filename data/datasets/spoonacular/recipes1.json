Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, up to 3 days; I made these after 2 days. Chilling the mac 'n cheese is an instrumental step and cannot be skipped because the cheese needs to congeal, solidify, and dry out a bit prior to baking the cheese balls. You may be able to speed this process up and shortcut it a bit by freezing the cooked mac 'n cheese, but I have not tested it. About 15 minutes prior to preparing the cheese balls, place the container of mac 'n cheese in the freezer for a quick cold blast. Meanwhile, place flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate small bowls; set aside.  Preheat oven to 425F and line two baking sheets with Silpats, parchment paper, or aluminum foil (line baking sheets with something to save yourself cleanup work). Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on each baking sheet, smear it around with your hands; set baking sheets aside. Remove mac 'n cheese from the freezer and using a 1-inch cookie scoop or tablespoon-sized scoop, portion out and shape the balls, taking care not to make them larger than about 1-inch in diameter because after battering and breading, they become much larger in size. Depending on the type of noodles in your mac 'n cheese, how cold, or how cheesy the mac 'n cheese is, lightly hand-shaping the noodles into balls may be necessary rather than replying solely on a cookie scoop. Roll each ball through the flour, dip briefly in the egg, roll it through the breadcrumbs, and place it on baking sheet. Repeat until all balls have been battered, placing about 10 balls per baking tray. Bake for 10 minutes (don't be surprised if your smoke detector goes off), remove trays from oven and add 1 tablespoon of oil to each tray and smear it around, flip balls over, and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until browned and golden.

Make the Rmoulade Sauce: Pulse all ingredients except salt and pepper in food processor until well combined but not smooth, about ten 1-second pulses. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve (the rmoulade can be refrigerated for up to 3 days).2. Make the Crab Cakes: Place  cup panko in small zipper-lock bag and finely crush with rolling pin. Transfer crushed panko to 10-inch skillet and add remaining  cup panko. Toast over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer panko to shallow dish and stir in  teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Wipe out skillet.3. Pulse celery, onion, and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 5 to 8 pulses, scraping down bowl as needed. Transfer vegetables to large bowl. Melt butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add chopped vegetables,  teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened and all moisture has evaporated, 4 to 6 minutes. Return vegetables to large bowl and let cool to room temperature. Rinse out pan and wipe clean.4. Pulse shrimp in now-empty food processor until finely ground, 12 to 15 pulses, scraping down bowl as needed. Add cream and pulse to combine, 2 to 4 pulses, scraping down bowl as needed. Transfer shrimp puree to bowl with cooled vegetables. Add mustard, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning; stir until well combined. Add crabmeat and fold gently with a rubber spatula, being careful not to overmix and break up lumps of crabmeat. Divide the mixture into 8 balls and firmly press into 1/2-inch-thick patties. Place cakes on rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.5. Coat each cake in panko, firmly pressing to adhere crumbs to exterior. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place 4 cakes in skillet and cook without moving them until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip cakes, add 1 tablespoon oil, reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer cakes to platter. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining 4 cakes and remaining 2 tablespoons oil.

Boil for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, but not falling apart.Meanwhile, fry the bacon on the stovetop until crispy. Remove the bacon strips to a paper towel lined plate. Once they're cool enough to handle, crumble the bacon and set aside.When the potatoes are done, drain them in a colander, then return them to the pot. Place the pot back on the burner, and use a potato masher to mash them over very low heat. We want most of the steam to escape. Continue mashing until no lumps remain.Turn off the heat, then add 4 Tablespoons of butter and  cup of milk or cream. Slowly mash in the added ingredients until smooth. Continue to add the cream, a little bit at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. Sometimes I add a full cup, and sometimes it's only  cup. Taste the potatoes and season with salt and pepper as needed.Spread the potatoes out into a 9 inch deep dish pie dish and cover with shredded cheese and the crumbled bacon. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until cheese is melted. Allow the casserole to cool for 10-15 minutes before adding the spider web.To make the web, add the sour cream to a zip lock bag and cut a tiny hole in one corner. Twist the bag above the sour cream and use your hand to squeeze the sour cream towards the hole. You may want to practice drawing a line once or twice before doing it on the casserole.You'll start the web by drawing four straight lines through the center of the casserole, like you would cut a pie. Start by making a T through the center, and then follow that with an X through the center. In the end, you should have eight equal spaces. Starting in the center of the pie, draw a small circle, connecting each of the eight sections. Move a few inches outward and draw another circle. Move another inch or two outward and draw one final circle. Top with a fake spider of one made from olives. Serve while the potatoes are still warm.

Stir together until thoroughly combined and let cool for 5 minutes or so.Pour some water into a small dish and set aside. On a flat surface, place an egg roll wrapper, corner facing toward you (like a diamond) and put \u00bc cup of the chicken mixture on the center of the wrapper. Spread the mixture in a horizontal line from the left corner to the right corner of the wonton wrapper, leaving \u00bd inch or so of space on each side. Fold the bottom corner closest to you up over the ingredients and give it a 90 degree roll. Fold the side corners in and tuck them as you give the filled section another 90 degree roll. Dip your finger in the dish or reserved water and lightly wet the edges of the remaining top corner of the wrapper. Finish rolling the filled egg roll over the wet corner so that it adheres.

cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and orange zest until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until a sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. Meanwhile, roll out the dough until 1/2 inch thick on a floured surface. (The dough will be sticky.) Cut out rounds using a 1-inch-round cookie cutter, dipping the cutter in flour each time. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet.Set a rack on another baking sheet. Working in batches, carefully fry the doughnut holes until puffed and browned, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to the rack using a slotted spoon or wire strainer.Make the glaze: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately pour over the chocolate; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth, then whisk in the corn syrup and vanilla. Set aside until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes. Dip the doughnut holes in the glaze, transfer to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with nonpareils. Let sit at least 1 hour before serving.Photograph by Kate Mathis                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

Puree cottage cheese in a food processor. Add sugar, oil, milk and vanilla and process until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and pulse 4 to 5 times, just until the dough clumps together. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and press the dough into a ball. Knead several times, but do not overwork. Dust with flour, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make Raspberry Sauce and prepare toppings.To assemble &amp; bake pie: Position oven rack at the lowest level; preheat to 400F. Coat a 12-inch pizza pan or large baking sheet with cooking spray. Sprinkle with cornmeal, shaking off excess.On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Roll the dough back over a rolling pin and transfer to the prepared pizza pan or baking sheet. Finish the edges by turning them under. To glaze the border, brush it very lightly with a little milk and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar.Spread the crust with Raspberry Sauce; scatter pineapple, kiwi and strawberries (or cranberries) on top. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake until the crust is golden and crisp, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, warm white chocolate in the microwave on Defrost until slightly softened but not melted, 20 to 40 seconds. Grate on a vegetable grater. (If the chocolate breaks into fine shreds, rather than large ones, continue to microwave, checking every 10 seconds.)Sprinkle the grated chocolate over the hot pie; let stand until melted. Cut the pie into wedges; serve warm or at room temperature. makes 8 servings. per serving: 244 calories; 8 g fat (2 g sat, 4 g mono); 1 mg cholesterol; 38 g carbohydrate; 5 g protein; 2 g fiber; 234 mg sodium.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/dessert-pizza-694995", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 65, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Jalapeno-Hamburgers-471303.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 471303, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Jalapeno Hamburgers", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 tablespoons Cajun seasoning", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cajun seasoning", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1032028, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cilantro", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "4 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "jalapeno peppers", "metaInformation": ["minced", "seeded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11979, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 pound lean ground beef", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "lean ground beef", "metaInformation": ["lean"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/meat-ground-red.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 23557, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "tomato paste", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11887, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 68.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Jalapeno-Hamburgers/Detail.aspx?src=rss", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 127, "instructions": "In a medium bowl combine ground beef, jalapenos, garlic, tomato paste and cilantro.

"instructions": "To make the brownie base:Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut parchment paper to fit the bottom and line the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Spray lined pan with nonstick cooking spray.Whisk to combine flour, salt, and baking powder in medium bowl; set aside.Melt chocolate and butter in large heatproof bowl set over saucepan of almost-simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth.When chocolate mixture is completely smooth, remove bowl from saucepan and gradually whisk in sugar. Add eggs on at a time, whisking after each addition until thoroughly combined. Whisk in vanilla. Add flour mixture in two additions, folding with rubber spatula until batter is completely smooth and homogeneous.Transfer batter to prepared pan; using a small off-set spatula or bench scraper, spread batter evenly and smooth the surface. Bake until toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into center of brownies comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 25-30 minutes. Cool on wire rack to room temperature, about 1 hour (do not remove the springform ring or parchment collar).To make the cake:Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 325 degrees. Line the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment and spray bottom and sides with baking spray.Combine chocolate, cocoa powder, and hot water in medium heatproof bowl; set bowl over saucepan containing 1 inch of simmering water and stir with rubber spatula until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup sugar to chocolate mixture and stir until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool.Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Set aside. Combine buttermilk and vanilla in small bowl and set aside.In bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whisk eggs and yolks on medium-low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add remaining sugar, increase speed to high, and whisk until fluffy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Replace whisk with paddle attachment.Add cooled chocolate mixture to egg/sugar mixture and mix on medium speed until thoroughly incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds, pausing to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add softened butter one tablespoon at a time, mixing about 10 seconds after each addition. Add about one-third of flour mixture followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until incorporated after each addition (about 15 seconds).Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture (batter may appear separated). Scrape down sides of bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Pour into prepared pan; smooth batter to edges of pan with an offset spatula.Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out with a few crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Cool cake in pan 15 minutes, then invert onto wire rack and cool completely.To make the Chocolate mousse filling:Place stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer or fridge.Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place the semisweet chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap and allow to heat for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate to a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed.Place heavy cream and sugar in the well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a well-chilled whisk attachment. Whisk on high until stiff peaks form, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer.By hand, whisk to combine 1/4 of the whipped cream into the melted chocolate until smooth and completely incorporated. Add the combined whipped cream and chocolate to the remaining whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together.To make the Ganache:Heat the heavy cream and the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil.Place the semisweet chocolate in a 3-quart stainless steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Reserve ~1/2 cup of ganache to use as glue for strawberries. Remaining ganache should be brought to room temperature (about 40 minutes).To assemble the cake:Spread mousse over top of the brownie base evenly. Use an offset spatula or bench scraper to smooth the top.Place cake round over mousse, pressing down lightly. Chill for 1 hour.Cover the edges of a round cake board with waxed paper strips. Remove springform ring and parchment collar. Use spatula to move cake to a cake board. Use a spatula to smooth the room temperature ganache over the cake top and sides, covering evenly. Place entire cake in fridge for ganache to set.Once ganache has set, remove waxed paper strips from cake board. Heat reserved ganache in microwave for a few seconds. Use as glue to attach 15-16 chocolate covered strawberries. Serve chilled and store leftovers in the fridge. Cut the cake with a hot, dry knife, using the strawberries as a serving guide (1 strawberry per serving).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-overdose-cake-510031",

Scoop about 1 teaspoon of the grated Parmesan onto each cracker. Cut the package of bacon in half (or cut pieces individually) and carefully, so the cheese doesn't fall off, wrap each cheese covered cracker with one half piece of bacon, completely covering the cracker. It should fit snugly around the cracker, but not be pulled too taut. Place the bacon-wrapped crackers onto the rack. Place the baking sheet in the oven for about 2 hours. Serve immediately or at room temperature!
