In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, grind oats for 30 seconds. Add all-purpose flour, white whole wheat flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and pulse again, just until combined. Add cubes of butter and pulse, just until the butter is the size of peas (about 8-12 pulses; not all butter pieces will be the same size.) With the machine running, pour 3 tablespoons milk into the feed tube and pulse just until the dough begins to form a ball. Add 1 additional tablespoon milk if the dough is not holding together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, form into a flat ball, wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease 6 mini pie tins (or a 9-inch pie shell) with cooking spray. If making mini pies: Divide the dough into 6 pieces (keep the pieces you are not working with in the refrigerator as you go). Roll each into a 6-inch circle, then transfer to the prepared pie shells. (If baking a single pie, roll into a 11 or 12-inch circle, then transfer to dish.) Crimp the sides, prick the crusts all over with a fork. Freeze the crust(s) for 15 minutes, then bake for 8-10 minutes (for mini pies) or 15 minutes (for a full size pie), until lightly golden. Remove from oven and set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F.To prepare the quiche filling: Heat olive oil over medium high. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add butter and allow to melt, then add the brown sugar and cook until bubbly, about 3 minutes. Add the pear and saut until tender, 3-5 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, thyme, nutmeg, and salt, being careful not to create too many bubbles.Scoop 1/4 of the pear-onion filling into each of the mini pie crusts (or place 1 and 1/2 cups in the center of a single pie crust. Pour the egg mixture over the top of each, until it nearly reaches the top, then sprinkle on gorgonzola cheese.

Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop. (Mine was doubled in 1 1/2 hours)To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour, cinnamon, sugar, salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining 3/4 cup flour to stiffen the dough. In the last two minutes of mixing, add the Craisins.Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour \u2013 all ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should 77 to 71\u00b0F. If the dough seems too dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems tacky or sticky, add more flour to achieve the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky.Immediately divide the dough into 16 (3.375 ounce) pieces. Form pieces into rolls.Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes.Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Poke a hole in a ball of bagel dough and gently rotate your thumb around the inside of the hole to widen it to approximately 2 inches in diameter. The dough should be as evenly stretched as possible (try to avoid thick and thin spots.)Place each of the shaped pieces two inches apart on the pans. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and slip each pan into a food-grade plastic bag, or cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the \u201cfloat test\u201d. Fill a small bowl with cool or room-temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float. Return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.Day Two: (or several hours later if that's all your schedule allows), preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the pot the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby. (I forgot to add the baking soda to the water. Fortunately, I didn't have any problem.)Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute, flip them over and boil for another minute. If you like very chewy bagels, you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you decide to replace the paper, be sure to spray the new paper lightly with spray oil to prevent the bagels from sticking to the surface.)When all the bagels have been boiled, place the pans on two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately five minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are baking only one pan, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven setting to 450\u00b0F and continue baking for about 5 minutes, or until the bagels turn light golden brown. You may bake them darker if you prefer. (I baked mine for about 15 minutes.)Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving. Optionally, when they come out of the oven and are still hot, you can brush the tops with the melted butter and dip them in cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon-sugar crust, if desired.

in a covered bowl in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before serving.To prepare sandwich like Arby's use thickly sliced wheat bread, add a couple of slices of green leaf lettuce, and add about 1 cup of chicken salad to the sandwich.While they do not toast their pecans, I think you could easily bring this salad to the next level by toasting the pecans in a skillet on medium high heat just until they become fragrant. \u00a0Allow the pecans to cool completely before preparing the chicken salad.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/arbys-grilled-chicken-and-pecan-salad-599838",

Cool slightly and then transfer to a blender along with the reserved tomato juice and spices and process until smooth. Measure out  cup to use in the filling and set the rest aside for now.While the sauce roasts, make the filling. To do so, add the beef, onion, and garlic to a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook (uncovered) until the beef is browned and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat down to medium-low and stir in all remaining ingredients; continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.Pour the remaining Easy Roasted Tomato Chili Sauce into 2 (9 by 13-inch) casserole dishes and spread it out in an even layer. Spoon the beef filling into the poblano halves and arrange them in the bottom of the 2 casserole dishes. At this point, you can either bake or freeze the stuffed peppers.To bake the peppers, preheat the oven to 400F and bake (uncovered) until the peppers are softened, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle on the cheddar cheese and run it under the broiler until melted.Sprinkle on the Cotija and cilantro and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Care- fully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.                                                                                    6                                                                                                                                                                                                   Transfer the chicken to a clean wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 150\u00b0F and the legs register 165\u00b0F, 5 to 10 minutes; remove the chicken pieces to a second rack or a paper-towel-lined plate as they reach their final temperature. Season with salt and serve\u2014or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, go to step 7.                                                                                    7                                                                                                                                                                                                   Place the plate of cooked chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight. When ready to serve, reheat the oil to 400\u00b0F. Add the chicken pieces and cook, flipping them once halfway through cooking, until completely crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to drain, then serve immediately.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/the-food-labs-southern-fried-chicken-668067", "dishTypes":

Set aside.Ladle 1/3 of the sauce into a 9 by 12 by 2-inch rectangular baking dish, spreading the sauce over the bottom of the dish. Then add the layers as follows: half the pasta, half the mozzarella, half the ricotta, and one 1/3 of the sauce. Add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, and finally, sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling.
