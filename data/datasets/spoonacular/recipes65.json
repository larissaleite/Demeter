Add the canola oil when hot. Add the chicken and saute until the chicken starts to turn white, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the onions and continue to saute until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the apple, apricot, pear, raisins and garlic and saute until they begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir so the paste coats all of the ingredients. Add the red wine and cook until the chicken is tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and let cool slightly. Remove the seeds from the peppers by making one long slice down the sides, stuff them with the chicken-fruit mixture and keep warm until ready to serve.For the nogada sauce: Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the shallots and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to saute until the garlic has turned a light caramel color, about 1 minute. Add the white wine and reduce until almost gone, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cream and simmer until reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and finish with the almonds.For serving: Place each stuffed pepper on a plate and spoon some of the nogada sauce over top. Garnish with the cilantro and pomegranate seeds.

Scatter the almonds in a jelly roll pan, and toast until golden, about 10 minutes. Set almonds aside, but leave the oven on.In a food processor, grind the cookies until they are coarse crumbs. Transfer crumbs to a bowl, and stir in the flour. Stir in the 1/2 cup melted butter, and toss to moisten. Butter the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan, leaving the sides unbuttered. Press the mixture onto the bottom of the pan.Bake until set, about 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. When crust has cooled, place it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.Butter a 9x13-inch pan; you'll need this for the toffee filling. Set aside 3 cups of the toasted sliced almonds.In a large saucepan, combine the 1 1/3 cups butter, sugar, water, lemon juice, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook uncovered, without stirring, over medium heat until it caramelizes, about 8 minutes. Remove the caramel from the heat, and stir in the vanilla, almond extract, and 3 cups of the almonds. Pour the mixture into the buttered pan, and set aside to cool.In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth. Spread melted chocolate over the cooled toffee. Immediately sprinkle with about 1 cup of the remaining sliced almonds. Freeze for 1 hour, or until firm. Turn the toffee out onto a work surface, and break it into 1/2 inch pieces.Let the ice cream soften very slightly in a large bowl. Stir briefly, just until malleable. Fold in the toffee pieces. With a large rubber spatula, spread the ice cream into the crust. Top with the remaining almonds. Place the pie in the freezer. When it has firmed up slightly, cover the top with plastic.

Set aside to cool completely before removing from the pan(after cooling in the pan for about 10-15 minutes, I like to gently turn or spin the cookie cups, so that they release from the edges of the pan, and then cool completely. If you try this and they don't release they are likely too warm and will crumble).Once cookie cups are removed from the pan, heat sweetened condensed milk over medium-low heat and add chocolate chips. Continue cooking and stirring until completely melted. Spoon melted chocolate over candies in cookie cups or use a pastry or ziploc bag with the corner snipped. Work quickly because the truffles set relatively quickly. Sprinkle with Skor bits and press down gently so they set in the chocolate.Let chocolate set completely before serving. Can be stored at room temperature for a few days, or frozen for up to a few months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/double-chocolate-caramel-cookie-cups-plus-a-chipits-giveaway-623181", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 39, "servings": 48, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Magnolia Days", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Homemade-Thousand-Island-Dressing-564332.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 564332, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Homemade Thousand Island Dressing", "creditText": "Magnolia Days", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "apple cider vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon capers", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "capers", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/capers.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2054, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup chili sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "chili sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 6972, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 round dill pickle slices (about a tablespoon)", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "dill pickle", "metaInformation": ["( a tablespoon)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill-pickle-slices.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11937, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon ground mustard", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground mustard", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dry-mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002024, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Fresh ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground pepper", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 hard-boiled egg yolk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "hard boiled egg yolk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup mayonnaise", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mayonnaise", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 4025, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon chopped onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 X 1 1/2-inch slice roasted red bell pepper", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "roasted red bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11916, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon sweet pickle cubes", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "sweet pickle", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill-pickles.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11940, "unit": "tablespoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 31.0, "sourceUrl": "http://magnoliadays.com/2013/homemade-thousand-island-dressing/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 521, "instructions": "In a medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise, chili sauce, ground mustard, lemon juice and vinegar until combined.In a small chopper or food processor, add the sweet pickle cubes, dill pickle slices, roasted red bell pepper, capers, onion, and egg yolk.

medium heat, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil in a wok or large skillet.Pour in beaten eggs and scramble. Set aside to cool and then chop.Add 1 tablespoon of oil in the same pan and preheat.Add the carrots, and onion, if using yellow onion; cook for 2 minutes.Add cabbage and cook for 3 more minutes.Add the pork, green onions (if using), soy sauce, salt, and sugar; continue cooking until the vegetables soften, about 6 minutes.Add chopped egg and toss.Spread the mixture out onto a baking sheet and refrigerate to cool, about 1 hour. You'll find the juices will be absorbed once cooled. If not using immediately, cover once cooled and keep refrigerated. Use within 2-3 days.Add the flour to a large bowl.In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks, salt and sugar; add milk and whisk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk thoroughly; set aside.Fill a baking sheet with about 2 cups of room temperature water. Soak one rice paper in the water, right before you are about to fill one, for 5 seconds (as suggested by Three Ladies brand). Do not over soak. The paper will still appear hard, but will soften very soon. Place it on a damp tea towel. Do not use paper towels or they will stick to it. Re-wet the towel as needed.If using square rice papers, place one in front of you so that it appears as a diamond shape. If using round ones, it doesn't matter. Add 3-3 1/2 tablespoons  of filling close to the bottom. An ice cream scoop with spring action works well for this. Roll towards the middle and stop. Fold in the left and right corners. Then roll all the way to the top edge.When you are almost done with rolling, preheat a deep-fryer or pan filled with 2\" of oil to 375\u00b0F. (A deep-fryer works best, as it is difficult to keep the temperature even over the stove. However, it can be done. Just note that when you add the egg rolls to the oil the temperature drops significantly, especially if the egg rolls just came out of the refrigerator.)Using metal tongs, dip one egg roll at a time in the batter. Turn it around so not to allow all of the batter to drip off. Gently drop as many as can comfortably fit into the oil; turning occasionally. Deep-fry for about 7 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. They may look brown enough at 5 minutes, but they will not be crisp enough.Drain on paper towels, and serve warm with your favorite sauce.

small bowl, combine the topping ingredients (pecans, cinnamon and sugars).Sprinkle half of the topping mixture into the greased bundt pan, shaking it so the sugar coats all around (the pecans will most likely not stick, depending on how finely you chopped them - that's ok!). *Notes on the streusal: Be mindful of how much of the streusal you use to coat the pan; the cake can quickly become too sugary! Also, I prefer not to reserve some for topping AFTER baking, but if you wish to do this instead/in addition, you may need to make more toppingAdd flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to a bowl and blend together with a fork.Add butter and sugar to a stand mixer, and cream together on medium speed using a paddle attachment.Add the eggs, vanilla and sour cream while mixing.Add the flour mixture a little at a time while beating on low speed until everything is well blended.Transfer half of the batter to the bundt pan, then top with the chocolate chips (reserving a few for topping after baking) and the remaining streusal mixture evenly over the top of the batter.Drop spoonfuls of the remaining batter evenly around the top of the chocolate chips/streusal, and carefully spread until fully covered.Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean (if you use a 13x9-inch pan, baking time may be shorter - check earlier with a toothpick!).Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes.Use a butterknife to carefully remove the cake from the sides of the pan, and flip over onto a wire cooling rack.Place the rack on top of a piece of parchment paper, then top with chocolate chips.Once cooled, mix the glaze ingredients and drizzle over the cake (an easy way to do this is by using a small sandwich bag with a tiny hole cut in the corner).", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in all of the flour/sugar mixture. Continue to stir until the texture has a paste-like consistency, about 2 minutes. Place over medium heat and stir for 1-2 minutes, or until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and bottom of the pan. It should be glossy.Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on low for 30 seconds. Add the eggs one at a time, only adding the next when the previous one has been totally incorporated. Preheat the oven to 375. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large French star tip. Line two baking pans with parchment paper. Pipe the first eclair in a straight line, onto the parchment-lined baking pan, until it is about 6 inches long. Pipe 5 more eclairs on that pan. Repeat with second pan. Wet your finger and use it to smooth out any raised pieces of dough on the ends. Put the pans in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350. Bake for 40 minutes, rotating the pans halfway. Lower the oven temperature to 325 and bake for another 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 300 and bake for 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely before filling.To make the pastry cream, melt the white chocolate in the microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each. Set aside.Put the egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and mix on medium-low speed for 30 seconds. Reduce the speed to low and pour in the sugar. Increase the speed to medium ad whisk until light in color, about 1 1/2 minutes. Scrape down teh bowl and then whisk on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. Add the custard powder and whisk for 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl and then, with the speed on low, slowly pour in the almond milk. Scrape the bowl again and mix for another minute. Pour the entire custard base into a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until it begins to thicken. Switch to a whisk and whisk until it begins to simmer, cooking for about 5 minutes after you see the first bubble appear, and the pastry cream has thickened.Pour into a bowl. Whisk in the butter in two additions. Whisk in the chocolate in two additions, until incorporated. Pour into a container and cover with plastic wrap so that it is pressed against the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least an hour.Cut the eclairs in half and pipe the pastry cream into one half of them.

Yield: 1 loaf (1-1/2 pounds).

Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat to medium-low and let the ginger infuse the syrup for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Strain out the ginger slices and pour into a container for refrigeration. (Can be made several days in advance and kept in the fridge.)Slice two limes into 1/8\" slices and cut them into half moons. Slice one lemon into 1/8\" slices and cut them into quarters. Place the citrus in a sturdy mixing bowl, along with the 30 mint leaves. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over the citrus and mint, and muddle thoroughly. The sugar should be dissolved and the mint leaves well-bruised.Slice the remaining lemon and limes in half. Use a hand-held citrus squeezer or juicer (or, better, an electric juicer, if you have one) to produce one cup of lemon-lime juice. (You might not use all of the limes - reserve them for other usage, or slice them to garnish the bowl.)Scrape the muddled mint and citrus slices into the punch bowl. Add the citrus juice, the simple syrup, rum, and club soda. (Use 1 cup of club soda for a stronger drink, or 1 1/2 cups to lighten, depending on your preferences.) Stir to mix. Add lots of ice, and use a fork to bring the mint, lime, and lemon pieces to the surface. Garnish with extra lime and lemon slices, if you wish.Use a small ladle to fill each glass with the mojito mix, making sure to include mint leaves and citrus slices. Garnish each glass with a sprig of mint, if desired.
