For the Cajun aioli: In a bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice and Cajun seasoning until combined. Fold in the green onions, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.For the fried pickles: Combine the sour cream and pickle juice in a shallow dish. In a second shallow dish, whisk the flour, cornmeal and cayenne until combined.Drain the pickles and add them to the sour cream mixture. Then, using a fork, add the pickles, a few at a time, to the flour mixture and toss to coat.Heat 1/2 inch of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a large cast-iron skillet. In several batches, fry the pickles, flipping constantly, until golden brown and crispy all over, 2 1/2 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season with salt.

When oven is almost preheated, place butter in prepared baking pan and place in oven until butter is hot and sizzling.

Move off the fire and set aside to cool down. (Please keep the left in an airtight container.)Prepare all the other ingredients: golden syrup, alkaline water, flour and vegetable oil together. Combine golden syrup with vegetable oil and alkaline water in a large mixing bowl. Shift flour in. Mix well. Knead to a ball, wrap with film and reset for 1 hour in refrigerator. Make red bean paste according tothis guidePrepare the wrappers, soaked egg yolk and fillings. Divide the dough and red bean paste into 14 portions. I only use 6 egg yolks in my moon cakes this time. Some of those only use red bean paste as filling for the consideration for vegan friendly readers. How to assemble the moon cakes: wrap the egg yolks with red bean paste firstly. And then take one portion of the wrapper, press into a round wrapper and then place the red bean ball in center. Push the wrapper from bottom to top little by little until the whole ball is completely wrapped. Or you can roll the wrapper into a larger one before assembling. For more tips, see notes. When the assembling process is done, coat the ball with a layer of flour. Also coat your tool please. Place the ball on your board, then carefully cover with the shaping tool, press the rod and gently remove the cake from the tool.  In a small bowl, whisked the egg yolk and combine with egg whites. Preheat oven to 180C (356F).Bake for 5 to 10 minutes and then transfer out and brush a thin layer of egg brushing. Each time after dipping your brush into the egg brushing, remove the extra liquid otherwise the egg liquid might spoil the pattern on the surface. Continue bake for around 15 minutes until the moon cake becomes golden brown. Transfer out and reset to cool down. Place in an airtight container with film wrapped.

Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel to drain. Add the shallots to the bacon grease in the pot and heat over low heat. Stirring occasionally, cook until the shallots are caramelized - about 20 to 25 minutes. You can speed up the process with a teaspoon or so of brown sugar if desired, but I don't really like to add that to the gravy because I find it's a bit too sweet.Add half of the cooked bacon back to the shallots and increase the heat to medium Add the stock and bring it to a simmer. At this time, you CAN add any turkey drippings if desired.Add the cold water to a shaker bottle (or water bottle/mason jar) and add the flour on top. Shake the heck out of it for 30 to 60 seconds, until the flour seems completely incorporated and creates a slurry. With a whisk or fork in one hand, pour the slurry into the bacon drippings and shallots, sitting constantly with the other hand. Continue to stir to avoid any lumps and stir until the gravy has thickened, anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. Make sure you are scraping the bottom of the pan!If you love a super smooth gravy, you can add this entire mixture to a high-powered blender and (very carefully) blend until smooth. While I don't like chunky gravy, I certainly don't mind the shallots and bacon. Add the remaining bacon in right before serving so it stays crispy. Taste the gravy and season it to your liking. Set it over low heat for serving. My mom stores her extra gravy in the fridge for about a week. To reheat it, she places it in a saucepan (it will look disgusting) and adds a touch of water or stock. She heats it over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it's back to it's original consistency.

Set aside.In the bowl of your stand mixer (or a large bowl with a handheld mixer) beat cream cheese with your paddle attachment until smooth and creamy.Add cornstarch, and beat to combine.Add sugar, and beat until completely incorporated.Add eggs, one at a time, beating completely after each addition.Add vanilla, sour cream and whipping cream, and beat until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl at least once.Chop the BUTTERFINGER Peanut Butter Cup Minis and fold gently into the batter.Pour batter into the prepared springform pan.Drop the filled cheesecake firmly on to your countertop several times to release any air bubbles. Return the springform pan to the roasting pan.Place the roasting pan, with wrapped springform pan inside, into preheated oven.Fill the roasting pan with water, until halfway up the springform pan. Work quickly, so you don't release too much heat from the oven.Bake for 90 minutes. DO NOT open the door during baking.Remove cake from roasting pan, and allow to cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack.After 30 minutes, run a thin knife around the outside of the crust to release from the sides. This will help prevent cracking.Cool for another 30 minutes on a wire rack, then lightly cover and move to the refrigerator.Continue to cool for at least 4 hours, but ideally overnight.Before serving, top the cheesecake with warmed hot fudge sauce.Sprinkle chopped BUTTERFINGER Fun-Size over the top of the cheesecake, and as a garnish around the outside edge of the cake.Enjoy!",

Set aside. In a small pot, melt butter, peanut butter honey and brown sugar together over medium high heat until it comes to a bubble. Reduce the heat and cook lightly {like a simmer} for 1 1/2-2 minutes. Pour in vanilla and stir. Pour over dry ingredients and mix well to moisten evenly. Pour into lightly greased small jelly roll pan {about 12x8x1} and press out to be about 3/4 inch in thickness. {If your pan isn't small enough, pack the mixture into one side. You really want to press them down so they stick together.} Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips and pb chips and press them into the bars lightly. Cool on a countertop to room temperature for two hours or until the chocolate chips are set before cutting into bars. Wrap in parchment or plastic wrap and store at room temperature.Recipe Notes: If your granola bars don't seem to be staying together when you cut them, you may have not boiled the mixture long enough...you want it to make it just past the softball stage. OR you made them too thin or you didn't pack them in tight enough. Stick them in the fridge for 20 minutes and that should help keep them together. {Be sure not to keep them in there too long or else they'll become super hard!} The next time you make them, try

"instructions": "1. To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop.2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining \u00be cup flour to stiffen the dough.3. Transfer the dough tot he counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the dried blueberries during the final 2 minutes of kneading. The dough should be firm, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour - all the ingredients should be hydrated. If the dough seems too dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems tacky or sticky, add more flour to achieve the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky.4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 pieces. Form the pieces into rolls.5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes.6. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper and mist lightly with spray oil. To shape the bagels, poke a hole in a ball of bagel dough and gently rotate your thumb around the inside of the hole to widen it to approximately 2\u00bd inches in diameter. The dough should be as evenly stretched as possible (try to avoid thick and thin spots).7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pans. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the \"float test\". Fill a small bowl with cool or room-temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the pot the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby.10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil for another minute. If you like very chewy bagels, you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you decide to replace the paper, be sure to spray the new paper lightly with spray oil to prevent the bagels from sticking to the surface.)11. When all the bagels have been boiled, place the pans on the 2 middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 5 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are baking only 1 pan, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven setting to 450F and continue baking for about 5 minutes, or until the bagels turn light golden brown. You may bake them darker if you prefer.12. Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blueberry-bagels-507913", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Weary Chef", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/White-Chili--An-easy--family-friendly-dinner-514754.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 35, "id": 514754, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "White Chili: An easy, family-friendly dinner", "preparationMinutes": 3, "creditText": "Weary Chef", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 (15 oz.) cans great northern beans, drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned great northern beans", "metaInformation": ["drained", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 45.0, "id": 16026, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "6 c. chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "2 tsp. chili powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2009, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp. dried oregano", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "dried oregano", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2027, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh cilantro", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, minced or crushed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["minced", "crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc tsp. ground cloves", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cloves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2011, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp. olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 large onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breasts", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1055062, "unit": "lbs"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 97.0, "sourceUrl": "http://wearychef.com/white-chili/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 428, "instructions": "Heat olive oil in a dutch oven or stockpot over medium, high heat.

                                                     In a small saucepan, heat 6 tablespoons of milk and 2 tablespoons water until just slightly warm. Pour into a bowl with 1 heaping teaspoon of sugar, whisk to dissolve. Add 1/4 ounce of fresh yeast and whisk to break up and dissolve the yeast. Pour into a standing mixer bowl with the paddle attachment. Turn on low, add 5 tablespoons melted butter. Add the flour and salt and mix just until it comes together. Raise the speed to medium, add the eggs, one at a time, and mix until it becomes elastic and smooth. Turn dough into a bowl, cover with a damp tea towel, and let it rest and proof for 10 minutes. Punch down and allow to rise another 5 minutes. The dough should not proof too long, or the savarins will become crumbly.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Butter each savarin ring. Using your finger, schmear baba dough in the ring to fill it up half way, using about 1 ounce of dough. It will stick to your fingers, but don't dip your fingers in flour to prevent this. Let the dough rise until it reaches the top of the ring, about 30 minutes. Bake the savarins for 15 minutes. Let the cool in their rings then turn them out.To prepare the syrup, place all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Dip the savarins in the syrup then place them in a rectangular pan and drizzle more syrup over them. Cover and let them soak overnight. Add more syrup the next day if they'll absorb it.To serve, cut up the strawberries and stir the honey into the creme fraiche. Serve the savarin on a plate with a spoonful of strawberries and a large dollop of honey-creme fraiche. You may put the leftover syrup in a decorative bottle and pour more of it over the dessert as you serve it at the table.
