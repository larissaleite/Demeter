Gather it and pat just a few times to get it to come together. The top won't be smooth, but the rough surface creates a crunch that is part of a scone's charm. Gently form dough into a 7- to 8-inch disk (or, for smaller scones, into two 4- to 5-inch disks), brush with the egg wash, and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Cut the disk into 6 wedges, like a pie.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Bake: Place the scones on the prepared pan, in a grid with 3 by 2 for large scones and 4 by 3 for small scones. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes (20 to 25 minutes for small scones), rotating the pan halfway through the baking time. The scones should be golden brown.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cook-the-book-grand-central-bakery-scones-195670", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "dessert", "brunch",
