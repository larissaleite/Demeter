cooking spray and line with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang on all sides. Combine the vanilla wafers and pretzels in a large zip-top bag; crush with a rolling pin until you have coarse crumbs with some large pieces. Transfer to a medium bowl.Beat 2 3/4 cups heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and continue beating until just stiff, about 1 more minute. Mix 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and 3/4 cup dulce de leche in a small bowl, then fold the mixture back into the remaining whipped cream until combined. Mix 2 cups of the dulce de leche whipped cream into the cookie-pretzel crumbs.Spread half of the remaining dulce de leche whipped cream in an even layer in the prepared dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cookie-pretzel mixture on top and gently smooth with an offset spatula or your fingers. Top with the remaining dulce de leche whipped cream and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.Uncover and invert onto a platter; remove the plastic. Beat the remaining 1 1/4 cups heavy cream with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, about 2 more minutes. Spread on top of the cake. Put the remaining 1/4 cup dulce de leche in a microwave-safe measuring cup; microwave until pourable, 20 to 30 seconds. Drizzle over the cake.What do you think this rolled crepe should be called?

Combine the cream, milk, vanilla bean and seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.Whisk together the yolks, sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin puree in a large bowl.  Slowly whisk in the hot cream mixture until combined, remove the vanilla pod, and whisk in the bourbon. Strain the custard into a clean bowl.Scatter the pumpkin bread cubes in a buttered 9 by 13-inch baking glass baking dish. Pour the custard over the bread, pressing down on the bread to totally submerge it in the custard. Let sit for 15 minutes to allow the bread to soak up some of the custard.Place the pan in a larger roasting pan and pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until it comes half way up the sides of the glass dish. Bake until the sides are slightly puffed and the center jiggles slightly, about 1 hour.Remove from the oven and water bath and cool on a baking rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.Spoon some of the Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise into a shallow bowl, top with some of the bread pudding and drizzle with the Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce. Top with freshly whipped cream. Bread pudding is best served warm.                                                Pumpkin Bread:                                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter or lightly spray the bottom and sides of a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a small bowl.In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the 4 tablespoons softened butter, sugar, and oil at high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl a few times.Add the pumpkin puree and mix until combined.  Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix until just incorporated. At low speed, slowly add the flour mixture and water and mix until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a baking rack for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and let cool completely.Once the bread is cool, slice in half lengthwise, and then slice each half into 1/2-inch cubes. Spread the cubes on a large baking sheet and bake in a 325 degree oven until lightly toasted, turning once, about 20 minutes. Let cool.                                                Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise:                                        Bring the half-and-half and vanilla bean and seeds to a simmer in a medium saucepan.Whisk together the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until at the pale ribbon stage.  Slowly whisk in the hot half-and-half, return the mixture to the pot, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture coats the back of the spoon. Strain into a bowl and set over an ice bath. Stir until chilled. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.                                                Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce:                                        Combine the cream, apple juice, star anise, ginger, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and nutmeg in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let steep for at least 20 minutes. Strain the mixture into a clean, small saucepan and place back over low heat while you make the caramel.Combine the sugar, water and, vinegar in a medium saucepan over high heat and cook without stirring, until it's a deep amber color, about 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in the warm cream mixture a little at a time, and continue whisking until smooth. Add the apple schnapps and cook for 30 seconds longer. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm. The sauce can be made 2 days in advance and refrigerated. Reheat over low heat before serving.

Wash the beets. In a large saucepan or stockpot fit with a steamer basket, steam the beets until a paring knife enters them easily, 30 to 45 minutes, depending on their size. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm.    Peel the beets; the skin will rub right off. Trim and discard the tops and tails and cut the beets into thick wedges. Transfer the beets to a large serving bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the goat cheese, oregano, and pecans over the beets and serve.    Make Ahead Tips    You can cook, peel, and cut the beets up to 6 hours ahead.

Soak your cashews the night before as well, or for at least 4-6 hours before blending.OPTIONAL STEP: When ready to prepare ice cream, steep HALF of your fresh mint leaves in the coconut milk. Bring the coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan and add the mint leaves, then turn to low. Use a wooden spoon or muddler to puncture the mint so it infuses the coconut milk. Keep on low for 15 minutes, then kill heat and let cool. Once cooled, strain out the mint leaves using a fine mesh strainer and pour the coconut milk right into a blender. (If not doing this step, just add all of the fresh mint and coconut milk right into the blender. The flavor won't be AS strong, but it will still be delicious.)Add remaining ingredients, including DRAINED cashews and remaining 1/4 cup fresh mint (vanilla extract is optional) and blend until creamy and smooth - about 3-4 minutes, using the \"liquify option\" if you have it. Taste and adjust sweetness/minty-ness as needed.Add mixture to your chilled ice cream maker bowl and churn according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions until thoroughly chilled, about 45 minutes. It should resemble thick soft serve (see photo).While churning, prepare your raw brownie by processing dates in the food processor until small bits remain - it will likely form into a ball. Remove and set aside.Add nuts and process until small bits remain, then add back in dates and cocoa or cacao powder and process until well combined (see photo).Transfer to a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use hands to form into a \"brick\" shape. Set in freezer to chill.Once ice cream is done churning, break off chunks of your brownie and stir into the ice cream. I used about 3/4 of my brownie.Transfer ice cream to a freezer-safe container, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Will keep in the freezer for up to one week, though best when fresh.Before serving, let thaw on the counter for 10-15 minutes to soften.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creamy-vegan-mint-brownie-ice-cream-500819", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Leites Culinaria", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cream-Puffs-with-Pearl-Sugar-597206.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 30, "id": 597206, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Cream Puffs with Pearl Sugar", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Leites Culinaria", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 to 5 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon orange-flower water (optional)", "aisle": "Gourmet", "name": "orange-flower water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12411111, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "Pearl sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 36.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 vanilla bean halved lengthwise", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla bean", "metaInformation": ["halved lengthwise"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93622, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 2.0, "sourceUrl": "http://leitesculinaria.com/3279/recipes-cream-puffs-with-pearl-sugar.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 76, "instructions": "1.

Return the pan to the heat and, continuing to stir, cook until some of the moisture evaporates and the mixture begins to dry out a little, about 30 seconds. Remove the vanilla bean.3. Scrape the mixture into the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Stir on medium speed for 20 seconds or so to allow some of the steam and heat to escape. With the mixer on low, add 3 of the eggs, one at a time, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick but still fall slowly and steadily from the paddle when you lift it out of the bowl. If the dough still clings to the paddle, add 1 more egg and mix until incorporated. Stir in the orange-flower water, if using.4. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large (1/2-inch) plain tip, pipe 1-inch dough \u201ckisses,\u201d spaced 2 inches apart to allow for expansion onto the prepared cookie sheet (see Note).5. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 1/2 teaspoons water. Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle with the pearl sugar.6.

In bowl of food processor combine sorghum flour, brown rice flour, granulated sugar, salt, and baking powder. Pulse to combine. Add butter. Pulse until no large pieces of butter remain. Mixture should resemble a coarse meal.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Add water.

Add butter and use your fingers to break the butter into the flour until mixture resembles small peas. Whisk egg yolk with 1/4 cup cold buttermilk in a small bowl and then add the egg mixture to the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon, drizzling in more buttermilk as needed (no more than 1 tablespoon at a time), until dough just comes together (a few dry spots are ok). Gently knead dough on a lightly floured surface until no dry spots remain, about 1 minute. Divide dough in half. Shape each piece into a circular disk.Grease an 8-inch pie plate.Roll out 1 disk of dough onto a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch round (reserve the other round of dough for another use, you do not need it for this recipe). Carefully transfer the crust to the prepared pie plate. Lift up the edges and allow the dough to sink down into the dish. Trim edges to even out crust if needed, then prick the bottom of the dough with a fork a few times. Cover the pie plate and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour or up to two days.!PiePreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the pumpkin pie filling, mix together the pumpkin, heavy cream, brown sugar, egg, pumpkin pie spice, salt and vanilla in a mixing bowl until combined. Pour the mixture into the bottom of your chilled pie crust.To make the pecan pie filling, cream together the sugar and butter until combined. Add one egg at a time, scraping down the sides if needed until the eggs are fully incorporated. Add the maple syrup, salt, vanilla and bourbon until combined. Stir in half of the pecans.Carefully spoon the pecan pie over the pumpkin filling. Some of the two filling will mix, this is OK, but try your best to be careful with the pecan filling so you will get two layers of pie! Once you have added all of the pecan pie filling to the crust, sprinkle on the remaining pecans and chocolate chips (if using).Place the pie in the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes or until the center just has a little jiggle to it. If the top of the pie is burning before the center is done, cover with foil. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.

Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Remove 2 generous cups of the batter and place in a medium size mixing bowl. Stir the baking soda into the cooled chocolate mixture, and then using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula gently fold the chocolate mixture into the 2 cups of batter.Using 2 large spoons, alternate placing large spoonfuls of the chocolate and vanilla batters in the prepared pan, carefully spreading the batters so they touch each other and the sides of the pan. Make a second layer of batter, placing spoonfuls of vanilla batter on top of the chocolate, and the chocolate batter on top of the vanilla. Repeat, alternating the flavors, making about four layers. Firmly tap the pan two or three times on the counter to level the batter. Using a butter knife, zigzag the knife through the batter to swirl the batters, circling through the pan twice. Dont overwork the batters; you are creating a marbled look, not stirring the flavors together.Bake: Bake 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hours or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Place pan on a wire cooling rack to cool for 30 minutes then remove cake from the pan and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-marble-pound-cake-533449", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 130, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chunky-sausage---tomato-pasta-212989.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 212989, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chunky sausage & tomato pasta", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "400g can chopped tomatoes", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["chopped", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 400.0, "id": 10011693, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "parmesan, to serve", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "4 thick pork sausages, cut into bite-sized pieces", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "pork sausages", "metaInformation": ["thick", "cut into bite-sized pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1007063, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "500g pack rigatoni or penne", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "rigatoni", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rigatoni.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 500.0, "id": 11220420, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "tomato puree", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11547, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "200ml medium white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "white wine", "metaInformation": ["white", "medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "milliliters", "unitShort": "ml", "amount": 200.0, "id": 14106, "unit": "ml"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 88.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2625/chunky-sausage-and-tomato-pasta", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 30, "aggregateLikes": 510, "instructions": "Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based pan (preferably not non-stick) and add the sausages.

Sprinkle the veal with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 veal cutlets and cook until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer the veal to a plate. Add another tablespoon of butter and oil, if necessary. Repeat with the remaining 4 cutlets. Set the cutlets aside.Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Add the shallot and garlic. Saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add a tablespoon of the olive oil, if necessary. Add the mushrooms and saute until tender and the juices evaporate, about 3 minutes. Season with salt. Add the Marsala. Simmer until the Marsala reduces by half, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and the rosemary leaves. Simmer until reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Return the veal to the skillet. Pour in all of the pan juices. Cook just until heated through, turning to coat, about 1 minute. Stir the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter into the sauce. Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.Using tongs, transfer the veal to plates. Spoon the sauce over the veal and serve.
