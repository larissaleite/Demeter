Add the diced onion; cook, stirring, until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms; saute until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the broth and half-and-half. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until crisp-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain; shake off any excess water and add to the mushroom sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Make the topping: Soak the sliced onion in the buttermilk, 5 minutes. Combine the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Heat 2 to 3 inches vegetable oil in a large pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, drain the onion, toss with the flour and shake off the excess, then fry until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.Transfer the green bean mixture to a 4-quart baking dish and top with the fried onion. (The casserole and topping can be made up to 2 hours ahead; refrigerate the casserole.

I recommend teaching your children how to use a vegetable peeler. It makes this whole process much more pleasant for everyone. It\u2019s a lot of work for one person to do all that chopping and peeling.In a 9x13 inch pan (or similar), pour 3 cups of water and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Add the peeled apple sections to the lemon water as you\u2019re working. This will keep the apples from turning brown.Once all the apples are ready, place them in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the maple syrup and cinnamon sticks. Also add about 2 cups of water so the apples don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan during cooking.Cover the pot and bring the water just to a boil. Lower the temperature to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the apples are very tender. The time will vary according to what type of apple you\u2019re using. Stir periodically when simmering the apples.Remove the cinnamon sticks and mash the apples to the thickness you desire. If you want it very smooth (like store-bought applesauce), you can puree it in a food processor. I do it by hand with a potato masher.After mashing, return the cinnamon sticks to the applesauce and simmer gently (uncovered) for 5 more minutes.
