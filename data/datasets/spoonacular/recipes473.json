Pat dry a bit with paper towels, and then season the chicken with salt and pepper.In a large Ziploc bag, combine 1/2 cup flour, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. Shake well to mix. Place chicken pieces in bag and shake well until all pieces of chicken are evenly coated. Place liquid egg substitute in one bowl and the Panko, thyme, and salt & pepper in another bowl. Dip each piece of chicken in egg, shake off excess, then dip into Panko and turn to coat well.  Arrange the chicken pieces on the  wire rack and place in the oven. Cook for 15 minutes then, lower the heat to 375 degrees, and cook for another 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked through and crispy. While chicken is cooking, make the country gravy by melting butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium high heat. Whisk in flour, and cook for about another minute. Slowly whisk in the remaining 1 1/2 cups buttermilk,1/2 cup of the broth, and the poultry seasoning, whisking constantly and blending the liquid with the flour mixture until combined. Let the gravy come to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer until the gravy thickens up. If the mixture thickens too much, add more broth as needed until the gravy is the consistency that you want. Serve each chicken fillet, topped with about 1/3 cup of the country gravy.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/country-fried-chicken-with-gravy-7-points-603444", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Bourbon-Peach-and-Raspberry-Crisp-200397.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 200397, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Bourbon Peach and Raspberry Crisp", "pricePerServing": 214.85, "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 tablespoons bourbon", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "bourbon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bourbon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 10014037, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "10 tablespoons butter, chilled cut into small cubes", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["chilled", "small", "cut into  cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 10.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Zest of 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 blades (about 3/4 teaspoon) mace", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "mace", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2022, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "6 slightly underripe peaches, pitted and sliced into 1/2 inch think segments", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peaches", "metaInformation": ["pitted", "sliced into 1/2 inch think segments"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 9236, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup pecan halves", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "pecan halves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12142, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "12 ounces raspberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "raspberries", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raspberries.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 9302, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup raw (turbinado) sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "raw sugar", "metaInformation": ["raw", "(turbinado)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19908, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 36.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/09/bourbon-peach-and-raspberry-pecan-crisp-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 15, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "1", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/glass-baking-tray.jpg", "id": 406921, "name": "glass baking pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F with a rack in the middle.

Combine the bread crumbs, cheese, nutmeg, parsley, and orange zest in a shallow bowl. Put the flour in another bowl and the eggs in a third bowl.Cut the chicken breasts horizontally being sure not to cut all the way through to the other side so it will open like a book. Once the chicken is butterflied, lightly pound the chicken between waxed paper, parchment or plastic wrap into 4 large, very thin cutlets. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper and coat with the flour, then the egg and then the bread crumbs.Heat a 1/2-inch of frying oil in very large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the cutlets 1 or 2 at a time, depending on the size of the pan. As cutlets are done, transfer to a baking rack to drain. Cutlets may be served room temperature but you want them to remain crisp.While the cutlets cook, working next to the stove, peel and section the oranges and dice. Add them to a large bowl along with the tomatoes, oregano, if using, onion, extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste. Toss and when ready to serve fold in the arugula leaves.Transfer the cutlets to serving plates and top with mounds of orange and arugula salad before serving.

To serve, put a dog in each roll and top with the chili and some Cheddar.
