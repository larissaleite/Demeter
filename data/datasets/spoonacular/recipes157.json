Divide the cheddar on top and then add the onion and bacon. Bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a medium nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the chile and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Whisk the eggs in a bowl until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the pan and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until soft curds form. Add the goat cheese.Divide the eggs between the two pizzas and garnish with more herbs.                                                    Recipes reprinted from Brunch @ Bobby's by Bobby Flay.
