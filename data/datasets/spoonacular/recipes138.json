After a couple minutes, check the dough ... is it starting to pull together into dough? If not, add just a bit of water and check again in a minute. I used about 1 cup of water.While the dough is rising, in a small bowl, mix the olive oil, water, Italian seasoning and garlic. Set aside.When the dough is done, spray a large pan with cooking spray. I used my jelly roll pan, which I think is about the right size to get a perfect-sized focaccia. I also preheated my oven to 170 F and then turned it off to make a nice warm \"rising\" area for my bread.Push and stretch the dough out onto the pan, then sprinkle with sea salt, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 30 minutes. Uncover and poke holes all over the bread with your finger ... then drizzle the olive oil mixture over top and add the cherry tomatoes. Cover again and let it set for another 20 minutes.

Pour in the milk and stir until you have a dough that hasn\u2019t quite come together. Dump it on the counter and knead it a few times to work in the dry flour.3. Divide the dough in half. Roll one half out until it is large enough to line a 10-inch pie plate. The other half can sit unless the kitchen is hot. If it is, refrigerate the dough (or work fast).Make the tomato filling4. Mix the tomatoes with the herbs, half the cheddar, and some salt. Pat this out evenly in the pastry. Spread the tomatoes with the mayo and scatter the rest of the cheese on top.5.
