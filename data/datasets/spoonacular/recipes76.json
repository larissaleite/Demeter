Add the onion, pepper, garlic and Italian seasoning. Season well with salt and pepper.

Add about 1/4 cup water to the empty tomato can and slosh it around to mix with any remaining sauce and add it to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook 25 - 30 minutes, stirring often.

Lightly grease a large roasting pan or baking sheet with sides large enough to comfortably fit all the chicken.In a wide, shallow dish mix the Parmesan and bread crumbs together. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken one at a time with the crumbs patting them on with your hands - the chicken will be thinly covered - some of the chicken will show through - that's ok. Place them in the baking sheet at least an inch apart.Bake 15 minutes. Meanwhile cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling water according to package directions to al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water before draining.Remove the chicken from the oven and top with the pepperoni - dividing it up evenly between the chicken, then do the same with the mozzarella, piling it on top. Put them back in the oven about 5 minutes until cheese is completely melted. Chicken should measure internal temperature of 165 - 175 degrees F. If you want the cheese to be golden you can place them briefly under the broiler.Mix the sauce into the spaghetti over low heat, mixing in a little of the reserved starchy water from cooking the spaghetti.

Allow to cool for 20 minutes in the pan, then carefully turn out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Slice the cake horizontally into four layers of equal thickness. Set the bottom layer of the cake aside; that will be the top of your stacked cake. Scoop 1/2 cup of chocolate buttercream onto one layer of cake and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of espresso powder and set the next layer on top. Scoop another 1/2 cup of icing onto the layer and sprinkle with another 1 tablespoon of espresso powder. Repeat with the third layer and top the cake with the reserved bottom layer of cake. Crumb coat the sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream and set the cake to chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Heat the ganache just to the point that it flows well but is not too thin or watery. Set the chilled cake on a cooling rack placed into a baking sheet and carefully pour the ganache over the entire cake, coating it in one smooth layer. Set the cake back in the refrigerator to chill for another 15 minutes to set the ganache.

Cut the hens in half with kitchen shears, cutting along one side of the breastbone. Place the hens on a rimmed baking sheet, cut-side down; season with salt and pepper. Scatter the lemon slices over and around the hens. Roast until the hens are golden, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 minutes. Add the couscous and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly toasted, 3 minutes. Add the broth; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 8 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, cover and cook until tender, about 3 more minutes; set aside.Combine the honey, cumin, paprika and lemon juice. Brush on the hens and continue roasting until cooked through, 5 to 7 more minutes.Stir the cilantro and lemon zest into the couscous and season with salt and pepper. Serve with the hens and drizzle with any pan juices.Photograph by Charles Masters                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the remaining ingredients and mix on low speedy until just combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping 2-tablespoon mounds (I made 15). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a\u00a0Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat or spray with cooking spray and place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart although they don't spread much. I bake 8 cookies per sheet. Bake for 8 to 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set. It's hard to tell with dark cookies when they're done, but do not bake longer than 10 minutes as cookies will firm up as they cool; baking longer causes cookies to set up too crunchy and crumbly. (The cookies shown in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled overnight, allowed to come to room temp for 15 minutes, and were baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated at the 4-minute mark). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/dark-chocolate-dark-brown-sugar-cookies-519943", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 18, "servings": 15,

Be warned: it\u2019s a bitch!Scoop out the pulp and seeds. Lay each half on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil and sprayed with non-stock cooking spray.Bake for about an hour until soft. Side Note: You can microwave the squash which is how I\u2019ve always done it but I\u2019m going to be honest. I like it better roasted! Another note: You can also roast the seeds of the spaghetti squash just like pumpkin seeds.While the squash is cooking, start the soup.Heat the oil in a medium-large soup pot over medium-high. Add the onion, garlic and carrots. Sprinkle with a little kosher salt. Cook until the onion softens and begins to brown.Add the peppers and cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften.Add the cumin, fennel and thyme. Stir and combine all the flavors.Add the broth, tomato sauce and can of water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer at least 20 minutes until everything is soft.Once soft, puree with an immersion blender or transfer to your blender in batches.Return to the pot and keep warm over low heat.By this time your squash should be about done.Take a fork and scoop out squash.Add 3/4 of a cup (116g) of squash to a soup bowl and top with 1 cup of the red pepper soup. I added a little more squash and a sprinkle of parsley for effect.Isn\u2019t it gorgeous?! I loved it! As you can see\u2026That bowl was 1 cup of soup over 3/4 cup of squash and it was a great serving. I measured out 8 cups of broth from the recipe. I\u2019m not sure if I have enough spaghetti squash for 8 servings, but I\u2019m going to share the nutritional information for that size servings.

Pierce the potatoes in a few places with a fork and microwave until almost tender, about 10 minutes, turning halfway through.

Add the kielbasa and cook, stirring, until it starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the onion and caraway seeds and cook until the onion is soft, about 3 minutes.Stir in the potatoes, then flatten the hash into an even layer, pressing gently with a spatula. Cook undisturbed until crunchy and browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip the hash in sections and cook until browned on the other side, about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat.Using a spoon, make 4 shallow indentations in the hash and crack 2 eggs into each. Transfer to the oven and bake until the egg whites set, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top with the parsley and scallions.Per serving: Calories 449; Fat 25 g (Saturated 10 g); Cholesterol 485 mg; Sodium 821 mg; Carbohydrate 34 g; Fiber 3 g; Protein 23

Cook the pasta until al dente, according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl. Spiralize the zucchini with a spiralizer (here's how), or turn the zucchini into noodles with a julienne peeler, or grate the zucchini the long way on a large box grater.Toast the walnuts: In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook the walnuts, stirring occasionally, until they smell nice and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Set aside to cool.Cook the cherry tomatoes: In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cherry tomatoes, olive oil and a pinch of salt. Cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have burst open and they are cooking in their own juices, about 7 to 8 minutes. Set aside.In a food processor, combine the walnuts, half of the cooked tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, red pepper flakes,  teaspoon salt and several twists of freshly ground black pepper. Blend until the mixture is pretty smooth, then season to taste with additional lemon juice, salt and/or pepper until the flavors really sing. Blend again.Pour the pesto over the spaghetti and toss to combine. If you'll be consuming this dish in one sitting, go ahead and toss in all of the zucchini noodles now, too. (If you plan on having leftovers, store the zucchini noodles separately from the rest, as they leach water when they're exposed to saltI just pile the noodles on top of my individual bowls and wait to stir them in when I'm ready to eat. Hope that makes sense.)Pour the rest of the cherry tomatoes on top of the dish, and sprinkle the basil over them. Toss gently, and divide the mixture into bowls. Top individual bowls with Parmesan or nutritional yeast, if you'd like, and a light drizzle of olive oil.

Let cool 15 minutes.To assemble: Remove the cheesecake mixture from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes or until soft enough to pipe. Spoon the filling into a piping bag and pipe some of the mixture into the bottom of a small serving glass. Add some of the caramel apples on top then pipe more cheesecake on top.

Lay down a layer of shredded lettuce on the bottom of the sandwich, then arrange the shrimp on top.

"veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 21, "aggregateLikes": 99, "instructions": "In a small bowl mix together sugar and cinnamon, set aside with a spoon.Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat (I set my griddle to 350 degrees).In a broad bowl (I used a pie pan) beat the eggs lightly and stir in the milk and salt.  Set an empty plate beside it.Add about teaspoon of butter to skillet and spread around as it melts.Quickly dip each side of bread into the egg mixture (you don\u2019t want it too soggy) and then place on the empty plate.  Add a heaping spoonful of cinnamon-sugar and spread around until the surface of the bread is completely covered (add more cinnamon-sugar as needed), flip over and repeat on the other side. Place on the skillet. Repeat with remaining slices of bread until the skillet/griddle is full.Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until each side is nicely browned and the sugar mixture has melted and hardened into slightly crispy coating.In a large bowl or your electric mixer bowl, mix together flours, sugar, salt, yeast and cinnamon.Add egg, butter, buttermilk and water.  Stir with a large spoon or on low speed with the paddle attachment of your mixer until everything comes together in a ball.  If you\u2019re using a mixer you\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready if the dough stops sticking to the sides of the bowl.  If it seems too sticky or too dry add a little more flour or water.If you are using a mixer, switch to the dough hook. Mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes.  If you don\u2019t have a mixer or want to do all the kneading by hand skip to the next step. Sprinkle a work surface with flour and transfer the dough over to it. Knead for about 1-2 minutes if you just used the dough hook or 8-10 minutes if not.  You\u2019ll most likely need to add more bread flour to the dough as you are kneading to keep it from being sticky.  The end result should be dough that is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. (See this post for the difference between the two.) To test whether the dough is ready, cut off a golf ball-sized piece and use your fingers to stretch it into a very thin sheet which looks almost translucent when held up to the light.  If it won\u2019t stretch and/or tears too easily, then you need to keep kneading until the dough passes the windowpane test.  It\u2019s also helpful to have an instant read thermometer because the dough should be ready when it\u2019s between 77-81 degrees. Flatten the dough out with your hands and spread a handful of raisins on top, pressing them into the dough.  Fold the dough in half and spread some more raisins on top of that.  Keep folding and flattening the dough until you have incorporated all the raisins, then knead lightly for a minute or two until they are evenly mixed throughout the dough.Place the dough inside a large bowl that has been sprayed lightly with cooking spray or oil.  Roll the dough around to lightly coat it in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 2 hours at room temperature or until the dough doubles in size.Meanwhile, mix together sugar and cinnamon and set aside.When the dough has risen, remove from bowl and divide into 2 equal pieces (it helps to have a kitchen scale, if you\u2019re not good at eyeing it).  Roll each piece out into a 5 inch by 8 inch rectangle that is about 1/3 inch thick. Sprinkle half the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top. Starting at the short end, roll up the dough, pinching the crease down after each rotation to strengthen the surface tension.  The loaf will spread out as you roll it up.  Pinch the final seam closed with your thumbs and rock gently to even it out.  Place in a lightly oiled 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 in. loaf pan, the ends of the loaf should touch the ends of the pan. Repeat with the other piece of dough.Mist the tops lightly with cooking spray or spray oil and cover with plastic wrap.  Proof at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or until the dough has nearly doubled in size and crests above the top of the pan.  My house tends to be a bit cold (I like it that way), so to help the dough rise, I turn my oven on a low temperature for about a minute, then turn it off and open the door for about 30 seconds.  While the oven is still slightly warm (but still off), I place the pans inside, close the door and let the dough proof in there.Remove the pans from your oven if you proofed them in there and preheat to 350 degrees (F), with the oven rack in the middle.  Place the loaf pans on a large sheet pan, making sure they are not touching each other.Bake for 15 minutes.  Rotate the sheet pan 180 degrees and continue baking for 15-25 minutes.  The loaves should be golden brown on top and lightly golden on the sides.  It should register 190 degrees in the center.Immediately remove from pans (you can also check the bottom of each loaf, which should make a hollow sound when thumped) and cool on a rack for at least 1-2 hours before slicing.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/caramelized-french-toast-484190", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 4,

Lightly grease a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan.In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter, until fluffy. Beat in vanilla extract. Working at a low speed, gradually beat in flour and salt until mixture is crumbly, like wet sand. The dough does not need to come together. Pour crumbly dough into prepapred pan and press into an even layer. (I used the bottom of a flat glass to help with this.)Bake for 20-25 minutes, until base is set and edges are lightly browned. Cool completely before topping.Reduce oven to 300. Spread coconut evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet (preferably one with sides) and toast 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, until coconut is golden. Cool on baking sheet, stirring occasionally. Set aside.Melt sugar in a heavy bottomed pan at medium-high head. Whisk it frequently to keep it from burning. When the sugar turns a dark amber color add the butter and stir until melted.As soon as it is melted remove from heat and slowly add the cream and vanilla stirring gently.Once the caramel cools for 10/15 minutes mix it with the toasted coconut. Put dollops of the topping all over the shortbread base. Using the spatula, spread topping into an even layer. Let topping set until cooled. (I stuck mine in the freezer for 10 mins to speed this along.) When cooled, cut into bars with a large knife or a pizza cutter (it\u2019s easy to get it through the topping). Once bars are cut, melt chocolate in a small bowl. Heat on high in the microwave in 45 second intervals, stirring thoroughly to prevent scorching. Dip the base of each bar into the chocolate and place on a clean piece of parchment or wax paper.Transfer all remaining chocolate (or melt a bit of additional chocolate, if necessary) into a piping bag or a ziploc bag with the corner snipped off and drizzle bars with chocolate to finish.Let chocolate set completely before storing in an airtight container.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/samoa-bars-571469", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Chocolate Chilli Mango", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/raspberry-yoghurt-verrines-703996.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 703996, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Raspberry Yoghurt Verrines", "creditText": "Chocolate Chilli Mango", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "66 grams (2.33 oz) egg whites, room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": ["room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.33, "id": 1124, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "6 grams (0.21 oz) gelatine leaves", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "gelatine", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/gelatin.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.21, "id": 19177, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "15 grams (0.53 oz) honey (orange blossom or other floral variety is best)", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": ["(orange blossom or other floral variety is best)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.53, "id": 19296, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "132 grams (4.66 oz) Natvia Icing Mix*", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "icing mix", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/frosting-or-icing.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.66, "id": 19230, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "250 grams (8.82 oz) non-fat thick Greek yoghurt*", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "low-fat greek yoghurt", "metaInformation": ["thick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.82, "id": 93652, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "5 grams orange blossom water", "aisle": "Gourmet", "name": "orange blossom water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 5.0, "id": 12411111, "unit": "grams"}, {"originalString": "250 grams (8.82 oz) skim milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "skim milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.82, "id": 1085, "unit": "oz"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 31.0, "sourceUrl": "http://chocolatechillimango.com/2016/01/06/raspberry-yoghurt-verrines/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "aggregateLikes": 38, "instructions": "Place the contents of the raspberry jelly sachet into a medium bowl.Add 250 grams of boiling water and whisk until the jelly crystals are completely dissolved.Add 250 grams of cold water and whisk again.Divide the jelly between serving glasses.  How many serves will depend on the size of each glass.For example, for 4 serves, allow 125 grams jelly per serve.Place in the refrigerator to set.  This will take several hours.  I prefer to make this the night before and let it set overnight.For the pannacotta, soak the gelative leaves in cold water to soften, for about five to six minutes.Place the milk and honey into a saucepan and bring to a simmer, whisking to dissolve the honey.When the milk begins to simmer, remove it from the heat.  Squeeze out the water from the softened gelatine and add the gelatine to the milk, whisking to dissolve the gelatine completely.  There should be no lumps.Set the milk mixture aside to cool.Place the yoghurt into a medium bowl with the orange blossom water and whisk to combine.When the milk has cooled, add it slowly to the yoghurt and stir until smooth.  Do not whisk aggressively as this will cause tiny bubbles and froth on the surface.  Tap the bowl on the bench a few times to remove excess bubbles.When the jelly is fully set, pour the cool panna cotta over the jelly in each glass. Again, divide the mixture evenly.  You will need about 125 grams if making four large serves, for example.Place back in the refrigerator, covered, and allow to set.Again, this will take several hours.Preheat the oven to 100C/212F.Line a large baking sheet with silicone baking paper or a Silpat sheet.Make sure your mixing bowl is squeaky clean and dry before starting.The egg whites should be at room temperature in order to achieve maximum volume.Place the egg whites and the Natvia in the bowl and whisk on low speed until frothy.  Increase speed to medium and whisk until stiff peaks form.  The meringue should be stiff enough to hold its shape when you raise the whisk attachment.If you wish to colour the meringues, add a drop or two of food colouring to the mix and whisk on medium speed until the meringue is evenly coloured.  I usually give the meringue a final whisk at high speed just for 20 seconds or so at the end.Scrape the meringue mixture carefully into a piping bag fitted with whatever favourite piping tip you prefer.  To make mini meringues, pipe small mounds or swirls (or roses, whatever) on to the prepared baking sheet.  Bake at 100C/212F, with the oven door slightly ajar, for about 60 - 90 minutes, until completely dried out.  They should be crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth when you bite into them.Decorate each verrine with fresh berries,  mini meringues and anything else you wish to add.  You can add edible flowers, chocolate, nuts, whatever takes your fancy.Undecorated verrines will keep for several days, covered, in the refrigerator.Leftover meringues will keep for several days,
