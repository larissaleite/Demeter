Add the  mushrooms to the pan and saut\u00e9 just until wilted. Remove the pan from the heat and drain out any liquid. Stir in the green cabbage, scallions and hoisin sauce until thoroughly combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let it cool for 10 minutes.Arrange the spring roll wrappers on a dry work surface then place 3 to 4 tablespoons of the chicken mixture in the center of each of the spring roll wrappers. Roll the wrappers around the mixture, folding the edges inward. Before your final fold, dip your fingers in water and then moisten the outer edge of the wrapper to seal the spring roll shut. (See Kelly's Notes.)Arrange the spring rolls in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a Silpat nonstick baking mat. Brush the tops of the rolls with olive oil then bake them for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating after 6 minutes, until they're golden brown and crispy. Remove the spring rolls from the oven and serve them immediately with the sweet chili sauce.Kelly's Notes:Spring roll wrappers can be found in the Asian section of most supermarkets. I highly recommend the Nasoya Egg Roll wrappers, which are found in the refrigerated section of Whole Foods stores. Sweet chili sauce can usually be found by the ketchup in most supermarkets. I prefer the Frank's brand of RedHot Sweet Chili Sauce.The number one rule to successful spring rolls is to roll tightly! The less space you leave within the spring roll, the less chance of it falling apart while baking.The rolls can be prepared up to three hours in advance and stored in an air-tight container in the fridge.

in a food processor and pulse until coarse, with small marbles of butter remaining. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the ice water, then pulse until crumbly and the dough holds together when squeezed. (If too dry, add another sprinkle of water, but do not over mix.) Transfer the dough to a plastic bag, press into a disk and refrigerate for one hour.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Roll out the dough on floured surface, then press it into a deep 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges to leave 1 inch of overhang, fold it under and flute the edges. Cut a piece of parchment or nonstick foil to the size of the pie plate and use it to line the pie crust. Fill with pie weights and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the pie weights and return the pie dough to the oven to dry out, about 8 minutes.Lower the oven to 325 degrees F.For the filling: In a double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate and butter, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat.In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, light brown sugar, eggs, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Fold in the melted chocolate mixture. Set the pie plate on a baking sheet and pour the filling into the crust. Bake until the center of the pie has just about set but still has a slight jiggle, about 1 hour. Let cool completely before serving. Top with chocolate shavings.

"instructions": "1. To Make the Crust: Place the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Scatter the pieces of butter over the flour mixture, using your fingers to toss and coat the butter with some flour. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with five 1-second pulses. Add the shortening and continue to pulse until the flour is ple yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal with butter bits no larger than small peas, about four more 1-second pulses. Turn the mixture into a medium bowl.2. Sprinkle all but 1 tablespoon of the ice water over the mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold the water into the flour mixture. Press down on the dough with the spatula until the dough sticks together, adding up to 1 tablespoon of remaining ice water if the dough does not come together. Divide the dough into two balls, one slightly larger than the other. Flatten each into disks, dust lightly with flour, wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.3. Remove dough from the refrigerator; let stand at room temperature to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.4. Make the Filling & Assemble the Pie: Toss the fruit with sugar, orange zest, lemon juice, vanilla extract and tapioca; let stand for 15 minutes.5. Roll the larger dough disk on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer and fit dough into 9-inch pie plate, leaving dough that overhangs the lip in place. Turn the fruit mixture, including juices, into the pie shell. Scatter the butter pieces over the fruit. Refrigerate until ready to top with the remaining dough.6. Roll the smaller disk on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle. Lay over the fruit. Trim the top and bottom dough edges to \u00bd-inch beyond the lip of the pie plate. Tuck this rim of dough underneath itself so that the folded edge is flush with the edge of the pie plate. Flute the dough or press with a fork to seal. Cut four slits at right angles on the top of the dough to allow steam to escape. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking.7. Place the pie on a baking sheet; bake until the top crust is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until the juices bubble and the crust is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer.8. Transfer the pie to a wire rack; let cool for at least 2 hours before serving so the juices have time to thicken.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/strawberry-rhubarb-pie-507899", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 140, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Farm Girls Dabbles", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Caprese-Stacks-with-Grilled-Honey-Balsamic-Potatoes-497653.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 497653, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Caprese Stacks with Grilled Honey Balsamic Potatoes", "creditText": "A Farm Girls Dabbles", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 T. balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2069, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c. basil pesto", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "basil pesto", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pesto.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93698, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "fresh basil leaves for garnish, optional", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh basil leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "for garnish, optional"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "leave", "unitShort": "leaves", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "leaves"}, {"originalString": "1/4 c. honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19296, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 7-oz. container Galbani\u00ae Mozzarella Fresca\u2122 Medallions (OR substitute 12 slices from Galbani\u00ae Mozzarella Fresca\u2122 12-oz.

Drain and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes. Slice potatoes into 1/4'' rounds. You will need 18 rounds for this recipe.Heat grill pan over medium-high heat. Spray pan with non-stick cooking spray. You could also use an outdoor grill for this part, using the same medium-high heat.In a small bowl, whisk together honey and balsamic vinegar. Dip potato rounds into honey balsamic mixture and place on hot grill pan. Sprinkle potatoes with a bit of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes, or until potatoes have beautiful golden grill marks. Then flip the potatoes and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden grill marks are achieved again. Remove grill pan from heat. To assemble, place a grilled potato round on a small plate (for individual servings) or a large platter (for serving family style). Top with a rounded teaspoon, more or less to taste, of pesto, spreading it out across the potato round. Place a mozzarella medallion on top of the the pesto, followed by a tomato slice. Repeat the stacking with another layer...potato, pesto, mozzarella, tomato. And then top with a third grilled potato slice and a bit of pesto. Press a skewer or pick (mine were about 4'' long) down through the center of the stack to stabilize. Drizzle a bit of balsamic glaze over the top, letting it run down the sides of the caprese stack. If desired, top with a basil leaf for garnish, and sprinkle with additional salt and pepper.Serve at room temperature.Note: I used a balsamic glaze that I found at the grocery store. But you can substitute with a simple homemade sweet balsamic reduction. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup balsamic vinegar to a boil. Reduce heat to medium/medium-high and cook until the vinegar is thickened (like a thin maple syrup), about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of honey. Let cool completely. The glaze will thicken a bit more as it cools. This glaze can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, just let it come to room temperature while you prepare the caprese stacks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

"instructions": "Directions                                            Spice Cookies:                                        Start by making your spice cookies: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla, salt and egg and mix well. Add the flour a little at a time, mixing well and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix until well combined. Let chill for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.Split the dough into 3 pieces. Into one, knead the ground cinnamon in with your hand until well incorporated. Into the next dough piece, knead in the nutmeg. And into the last, the cloves.Pick teeny tiny portions of the cinnamon dough (about the size of a jelly bean), roll them between your fingers and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the nutmeg and clove dough (making sure to keep track of the separate flavors) until you have the desired amount of little cookies (20 to 30 of each). Bake until crisp, about 10 minutes. Let cool.                                                Butterscotch Cookie Coating:                                        Next, make the butterscotch cookie coating: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the butterscotch morsels and 1 tablespoon heavy cream in 30-second increments, stirring every 30 seconds, until the butterscotch is melted. A touch more cream can be added if necessary. Add the corn syrup and very gently fold the mixture until it's a thin, liquid consistency, only heating the mixture for an additional period of 15 seconds or less.Using a fork or slotted spoon (or, if you can use them, chopsticks work well), dip your cookies in the butterscotch mixture to lightly coat them (make sure you keep track of which flavor is which throughout--don't mix them up). The butterscotch creates delicious little pockets of butterscotch sauce while protecting the cookies from getting too soggy in the hot liquid panna cotta. Try to place them somewhere where the excess can drip off of the cookies a bit. Place the coated cookies in the freezer to harden, making sure not to mix up the different flavors!Get out whichever 4 glasses you would like to present your dessert in (this recipe made enough for four 8-ounce stemmed sundae cups that we used).  Wine glasses, martini glasses, tumblers, Irish coffee mugs--any of these work, but, depending on size, the layer size will vary!                                                Irish Cream Panna Cotta:                                        The Irish cream panna cotta will be the bottom layer, so the first to make. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream and vanilla. Gently bring to just a boil, then immediately remove from the heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cream and whisk well until the gelatin is completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then add the Irish cream liqueur and stir well.Divide the liquid among your 4 glasses and carefully place them in the refrigerator for 5 to 6 minutes to slightly set up. Get your cookies out of the freezer. Take out your panna cotta and add 5 to 6 of the coated nutmeg spice cookies to the layer (up to you!) and then return the glasses to the refrigerator to set up completely (will take up to 45 minutes).                                                Brown Sugar Maple Panna Cotta:                                        The next layer will be the brown sugar maple panna cotta layer. In a small saucepan over medium heat, gently bring the heavy cream, brown sugar, maple extract and vanilla to just a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.Making sure that the Irish cream layer is set up, divide the brown sugar maple liquid among your 4 glasses. Return to the refrigerator for 5 minutes to set up, then add your coated cinnamon spice cookies. Chill for 45 minutes to set up completely.                                                Honey Panna Cotta:                                        The final (top) layer will be the honey panna cotta. Heat the heavy cream and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until dissolved completely and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Whisk in the milk.Making sure the other layers are completely set, divide the honey liquid among your 4 glasses. Let set up for 5 minutes, then add your coated clove spice cookies. Let the final layer set up for at least an hour.We garnished each serving with a gingersnap cookie for a beautiful, rich holiday dessert.                                                            Cook's Note: As an option, to brulee the top of the panna cotta, sprinkle the surface of the dessert with granulated sugar. With a kitchen blowtorch, torch the sugar until brown and crisp.

brown sugar, paprika, coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, mustard powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large baking dish. Pierce both sides of the pork chops with a paring knife (about 12 times per side). Add the pork chops to the dish, turning to coat with the spice rub. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.Make the sauce: Combine the vinegar, preserves, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, red pepper flakes and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 8 minutes; let cool completely. Transfer 1/4 cup of the sauce to a separate bowl for basting. Set aside the remaining sauce for serving.Remove the pork from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before grilling. Preheat a grill to medium and lightly brush the grates with vegetable oil. Transfer the pork chops to the grill, cover and cook until lightly marked, about 4 minutes. Flip the pork chops and baste with the sauce; cover and cook 3 more minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, flipping and basting the pork chops every 2 minutes, until they are golden and well marked, about 8 more minutes.

Let the dough rest while preparing the filling.To prepare the filling, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl.Lightly coat a 9-round pan with nonstick cooking spray.On a clean, well-floured surface, roll out the dough into a 14x10 rectangle. Brush with the melted butter and sprinkle with the spiced sugar, leaving a  border on the two longer edges. Gently pat the spiced sugar into the dough with your palms. Carefully roll up into a log from one long edge to the other. Slice into 12 rolls using unscented dental floss (as shown in the video below). Arrange the rolls into the prepared pan. Cover the pan with a clean towel, and place in a warm draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until doubled in size.Preheat the oven to 350F. Once the rolls have risen, bake them at 350F for 18-21 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the sides feel firm.

Continue doing this until the rice is cooked.While the rice is cooking, prepare your quick parsley pesto. Add the pine nuts to a mini food processor, and blitz to form a coarse crumb. Add the parsley and olive oil, and blitz again to create your pesto.When the rice is just about cooked, return your vegetables to the pan, and add the parsley pesto (retain a little for drizzling over the top if desired).

middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Set aside. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season on both sides with salt and pepper.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat just until smoking. Place the steaks in the skillet and cook to sear, about 3 minutes. Flip to sear the other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer the steaks to the prepared rack and roast in the middle of the oven until the steaks are medium rare (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the steaks will register 125 degrees F), about 12 minutes.Meanwhile, once you have transferred the steaks to the oven, immediately add the mushrooms to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add parsley and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm.Transfer the steaks to a warmed serving platter, tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove any fat on the edges and cut the steaks into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve topped with mushrooms and with the spinach on the side.                                                Classic Creamed  Spinach:                                        Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a medium saucepan. Add the shallot and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.Increase the heat to medium. Whisk in the flour and cook until foaming but not browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in the milk. Add the cayenne and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.Add the spinach and stir to combine. Cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed. Serve immediately.

Add nondairy milk and banana to the blender and whiz until well combined. Pour into oat flour mixture, add raisins and stir to combine. It should be rather soupy. Add a handful (about 1/3 cup) rolled oats and stir. If it's still runny, add more oats. I usually add about 1/2-cup total. The batter should be thick like oatmeal (ha ha!) but not dry. Set batter aside and preheat oven to 375F. Grease a muffin pan and spoon batter into the pan. The batter will thicken and get a little sticky/tacky as it sets.\u00a0If it's so thick you can't stir it easily, thin it out with a little nondairy milk, but you shouldn't need to. It should be thick like oatmeal or heavy mashed potatoes. Spoon into 12 cups, top with cinnamon (and brown sugar if you like) and bake 10-15 minutes, or until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.Note: If you have a rather ripe (very sweet) banana, you probably don't even need the sugar, especially if you're used to eating unsweetened oatmeal.

To make 1/2 cup: grate 1 pound of daikon together with 16 dried chilies that have been soaked in hot water for 5 minutes.Lightly season the fish with salt all over, including the cavities. Let the fish rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.Wipe off moisture that accumulates on the surface of the fish with paper towels.Cut a 1/2-inch-deep slit lengthwise along the centerline of each fish, from head to tail. Do this on both sides; the cuts will help the fish cook faster and make it easier to flake off the grilled flesh.To make the dipping sauce, divide the momiji oroshi and scallions between the 4 bowls of ponzu; set aside.Preheat a grill to medium-hot. Brush the cooking grate clean and oil it well.Grill the fish about 5 minutes per side. Flip the snappers with caregently turn them with a fish spatula so they dont break apart. When the fish are ready, youll see juice bubbling from the back, and if you peek inside the cavity, youll see that the spine and flesh near it will have turned white.Serve the fish immediately, accompanied by the ponzu dipping sauce.
