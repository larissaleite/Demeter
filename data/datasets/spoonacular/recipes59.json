Combine butter, shortening and cream cheese in a large bowl, beat together until smooth. Add sugar and salt. Beat until combined. Beat in egg and almond extract until combined and gradually add the flour beating until combined.2. Form dough into a ball with your hands and then into a log shape, divide the log shape into six portions (or how ever many colors you want).3. Place each portion of dough into individual wraps of plastic and tint the dough different colors (See Below for instructions on how to tint the dough)4. Chill tinted dough in the refrigerator 1 hour or freezer 15-20 minutes.5. Divide each tinted chilled dough ball into 8 equal pieces.6. Take one piece of each colored dough (leaving the rest in the fridge while you work) and roll out like a rope or snake on your counter-top. If you use a piece of waxed paper on the counter, you shouldn't have to add any flour.7. Roll the rope shape to about 6 inches long. Continue rolling all the colors and stacking them into a pile. Gently press the ropes together and roll the large multicolored \"rope\" on the counter to round and smooth it and if desired to lengthen it to 10 to 12\".8. Cut the multicolored \"rope\" into two pieces, using both hands, roll with your palms in different directions on both end of the rope pieces to twist it gently.9. Coil the rope into a poop shape, using your imagination as to what you think unicorn poop should look like10. Press in some silver candy balls (dragee) into the dough pieces to decorate if desired. Place dough on greased cookie sheet (or one covered with parchment or silicone mat) and bake at 375 F for 8-10 minutes until cookies are set and bottoms are light brown, they will not spread very much.11. Cool on wire rack.12. Coat with sparkle gel and/or edible glitter to give them some sparkle and add some sprinkles to the still wet gel for more texture. Let cookies dry completely before stacking.-----------------------------Dough Coloring Tint-----------------------------Do this prior to chilling the dough, so that you don't undo the chilling process with your body heat.1. Get a large piece of plastic wrap (to protect your hands and table from the dye), place a ball of cookie dough in the middle.2. Poke a well in the center with your thumb.3. Add the food coloring to the well and then fold the dough over the coloring.4.  Wrap it in the plastic wrap, and begin kneading the food coloring into your dough.This may take a while and you may find that you need more food coloring (Hint: Colored Cookie Dough bakes lighter than what you see when you first tint the dough, once you've gotten the right color tint, add more).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/unicorn-poop-cookies-317964", "vegetarian": false,

To the bowl, add ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, 2 tablespoons ketchup, worcestershire sauce, egg, salt and pepper, and cheddar cubes. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.                    Shape the mixture into a loaf on the prepared baking sheet. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons of ketchup on top.                    Bake 40 - 45 minutes or until the inside reaches 160F.

Preheat the oven to 375F (190C).2. Wash the yam, pierce it once or twice with a fork, and place it in a small roasting pan lined with foil. Roast it until completely soft, about 45 minutes (or longer if youve got a very large yam). Let it cool slightly, then peel.3. While the yam is roasting, chop the onion and saute it in a skillet with the olive oil and a pinch of salt over medium-low heat, stirring often, until its soft and browned, at least 20 minutes, longer if needed.4. Peel and slice the carrots, parsnips, and celery root and toss them in a soup pot with about 3 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, the honey, and the spices. Simmer the vegetables, covered, until they are completely tender, about 30 minutes. Add the roasted yam and the onion as soon as they are ready, along with the vegetable broth, grated orange rind, and citrus juices.5. Puree the soup in batches in a blender or in the pot with an immersion blender until perfectly smooth. Return it to a clean pot, bring it back to a simmer, and taste it. Correct the seasoning with more salt or a little more lemon juice if needed. Stir in the butter for a richer taste and silky textureor leave it out if you prefer a vegan soup.6. Serve the soup with a drizzle of fresh olive oil on top. For a really spectacular dish, drop a spoonful of dark red salsa in the center of each bowl. (A salsa that is not hot, just mildly spicy, and incredibly flavorful, is a splendid finish.)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pureed-carrot-and-yam-soup-with-citrus-and-spice-600100", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste and Tell Blog", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Easy-Ravioli-with-Sausage-and-Brussels-Sprouts-685571.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 13, "id": 685571, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Easy Ravioli with Sausage and Brussels Sprouts", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Taste and Tell Blog", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "12 oz Brussels sprouts, trimmed and thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "brussels sprouts", "metaInformation": ["trimmed", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brussels-sprouts.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 11098, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd lbs frozen cheese ravioli", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "cheese ravioli", "metaInformation": ["frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ravioli.png", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 93832, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "\u00be lb Italian sausage, casings removed", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "italian sausage", "metaInformation": ["italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/italian-sausage.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.75, "id": 7036, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup chicken or vegetable broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "vegetable broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 6615, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 75.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteandtellblog.com/easy-ravioli-sausage-brussels-sprouts/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 20, "aggregateLikes": 73, "instructions": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp and browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Pour off and reserve the bacon fat. You should have about 4 tablespoons bacon fat.2. To make the hash, heat the butter and 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the potato, onion, and apple and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the maple seasoning and cinnamon, if using. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm over very low heat.3. Meanwhile, cook the pork chops: Heat the remaining bacon fat in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the pork chops with the salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and cover. Cook, occasionally flipping the chops over, until they are golden brown and an instant-read thermometer horizontally inserted through the side of the chop into the center reads 145\u00baF, about 15 minutes. Uncover the skillet during the last 5 minutes. Transfer the chops to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.4. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings from the skillet. Whisk the flour into the pan drippings and let bubble over medium heat for 1 minute. Whisk in the broth, maple syrup, and cream and bring to a boil.

Line muffin pan(s) with 18 liners.In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar,  cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder,  tsp salt.In the bowl of your stand mixer (or using a hand mixer), beat together: 1 egg,  cup buttermilk, 2 Tbsp Greek yogurt,  cup oil, and  Tbsp vanilla for 1 minute on med/high speed or until well blended.With mixer on low, slowly add dry ingredients into wet ingredients until no clumps of flour remain.

Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes before removing from cupcake pan then cool completely to room temp before applying frosting.Beat together 8 oz pkg cream cheese with 1 cup powdered sugar (starting on low so you aren't covered in a cloud of powdered sugar, and beating until well blended and creamy (make sure no clumps of cream cheese remain or it will be difficult to pipe the frosting when done.Melt 4 oz white chocolate bar according to package instructions on the stove or in the microwave just until melted when you stir it (don't overheat chocolate in the microwave or it will turn crumbly). Once chocolate is no longer hot but still liquid, blend it into your cream cheese mixture on high speed until well incorporated.In a separate bowl, beat 1.5 cups cold heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form (about 1 min on high speed). Don't over-beat cream or it will turn buttery and will be difficult to blend. Fold whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well incorporated and smooth.Once cupcakes are cooled to room temp, pipe or spread frosting over cupcakes, sprinkle with shaved chocolate and serve. I used the Wilton 2D closed flower tip to decorate, but in hindsight, the Wilton 1M would have been easier to pipe this frosting on.

Here's Martin Cate's recommended technique: You'll need a 1-inch square of white bread, left out to dry overnight. Soak the bread in lemon extract, then place it in a hollowed-out lime hull. Float the lime hull in the punch and use a long match or lighter to set it on fire. This will create a dramatic tall yellow flame. Just be sure to have a pitcher of water and tongs on hand! If the bread starts to blacken and smell like toast, grab it with the tongs and dunk it in the water to extinguish the flame.

In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 30 seconds. Create a well in dry mixture and set aside. In a seperate mixing bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup sugar with lemon zest, then blend in buttermilk, lemon juice, eggs, lemon extract, vanilla extract and melted butter. Pour buttermilk mixture into well in flour mixture and whisk just until nearly combined (batter should be lumpy, don't over-mix). Butter griddle if necessary and pour batter onto griddle into rounds about 1/4 - 1/3 cup at a time. Cook until bottom is golden then flip and cook opposite side until golden. Serve immediately with Lemon Cream Syrup and fresh strawberries if desired.For the syrup:In a medium saucepan combine heavy cream, butter, sugar and lemon juice. Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to boil. Allow to boil for 1 without stirring, then remove from heat and stir in baking soda. Whisk for about 10 seconds until mixture becomes foamy and frothy then return to low heat and cook about 30 seconds longer (until baking soda flavor has cooked out), then remove from heat and stir in lemon extract. Serve warm. Note: Syrup can be stored in the refrigerator up to one week and reheated before serving.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy, adapted slightly from my Almond Poppyseed Pancakes", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

                                  Peel the beets and the shallot. Combine them in a food processor and pulse carefully until the beets are shredded; do not pur\u00e9e. (Or grate the beets by hand and mince the shallots; combine.) Scrape into a bowl.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then add the mustard, oil, and vinegar and toss.

Use equal parts beet and cabbage, about 1/2 pound of each. Shred the beets (with the shallot) as directed, then shred the cabbage by hand or by using the slicing disk of the food processor. Add 1 navel orange (including its juice), peeled and roughly chopped, to the rest of the ingredients.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Raw Beet Salad with Fennel. Use equal parts beet and fennel, about 1/2 pound of each. Shred the beets (with the shallot) as directed, then shave the fennel very thinly. Omit the Dijon and substitute lemon juice for the sherry vinegar.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Raw Beet Salad with Carrot and Ginger. Use equal parts beet and carrot, about 1/2 pound of each. Treat the carrots like the beets (you can process them together) and add about a tablespoon of minced ginger to the mix; omit the tarragon. Substitute peanut for olive oil, lime juice for sherry vinegar, and cilantro for the parsley.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Celery R\u00e9moulade. Replace the beets with 1 medium celery root or 1 bunch celery (1 to 11/2 pounds). Peel the celery root and cut it into matchsticks or trim the celery and slice thinly. Mince the shallot. In Step 2, replace the olive oil with 2 tablespoons mayonnaise if you like.                                                                                                                            7

Simply combine the milk, lemon juice, and salt in a large pot over medium heat. Stir frequently until the mixture just simmers, then immediately remove the pot from the heat (curds will begin to form almost immediately and will increase in quantity as the milk warms). After the pot is off the heat, allow it to rest without stirring for 10 minutes.Line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth (you may alternatively use a paper towel), then set it in a large mixing bowl (the size of the colander and bowl should be such that the colander can rest on the rim of the bowl with sufficient space underneath to allow for drainage). Slowly and carefully pour the curdled milk through the colander, and let drain for 10 minutes. Once drained, remove the cheese from the cheesecloth, place it in a covered container, and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.Once the ricotta is cold, whisk it together with the heavy cream and beat by hand until the mixture is mostly smooth and slightly thickened (keep in mind that it will be a bit lumpy due to the natural texture of the cheese). Stir in 1/3 cup honey, whiskey, and vanilla extract. Taste, and add up to 3 more tablespoons of honey to suit your preference (note that the sweetness will be somewhat muted after freezing). Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Meanwhile, toss the red grapes with the honey and olive oil, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Place on a parchment-lined, rimmed metal baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes at 450 degrees until the grapes become wrinkled and soft. In my experience, some of the grapes may cook more quickly than others, so I recommend keeping a pretty close eye on them after the 20 minute mark to prevent burning.Place the walnuts in a dry saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat for 3-5 minutes until toasted and fragrant. Shaking the pan occasionally will help prevent burning.Top the fresh ricotta soft serve ice cream with the warm roasted grapes and nuts and serve immediately.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/fresh-ricotta-ice-cream-with-roasted-grapes-and-toasted-walnuts-523430", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eating Well", "cuisines": ["mexican"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/quick_guacamole-21835.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 21835, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Quick Guacamole", "creditText": "Eating Well", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 avocados, diced (about 3 cups)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "avocados", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9037, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "Fresh Tomato Salsa", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "salsa", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salsa.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 6164, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 71.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/quick_guacamole.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 66, "instructions": null, "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/quick-guacamole-21835", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 10, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Easy-apple-tarts-224542.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 60, "id": 224542, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Easy apple tarts", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 eating apples, peeled, cored and halved, then each half thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apples", "metaInformation": ["cored", "peeled", "halved", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9003, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "50g butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp golden caster sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "golden caster sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp ground almonds", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "ground almonds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93740, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "375g 13oz block dessert pastry", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "egg pastry", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dough.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 375.0, "id": 10018338, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "vanilla ice cream, to serve", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "vanilla ice cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-ice-cream.png", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19095, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 34.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/338606/easy-apple-tarts", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 17, "aggregateLikes": 31, "instructions": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.On a lightly floured surface, roll thepastry out to a rectangle about the sizeof this magazine and trim the edges toneaten.

In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the warm water, honey and sugar. Let the mixture sit until it begins to foam, about 10 minutes.In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, bread flour and salt and then make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil. Using a fork, incorporate the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, continue to work and then knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.Lightly coat a clean bowl with olive oil and then add the dough, turning once to coat the dough in oil. Cover and set in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour.Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; make sure the grill grates are clean. Have your pizza toppings standing by.Cut the dough in quarters, shape into balls and work with 1 ball at a time. Stretch each dough ball into a 9- to 10-inch circle by hand or roll into a bigger (and thinner) circle with a rolling pin.With a towel soaked in canola oil, coat the grill grates lightly in oil. Add the dough rounds and cook until grill marks form and the dough stiffens, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the crusts and cook for an additional minute.Remove the crusts to an inverted baking sheet (so they slide off easily). Load the crusts with the desired toppings. Return to the grill, cover and cook the pizzas until the toppings are warmed and the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove carefully, cut and serve.

Cover pot and wait 2-3 minutes for the kale to wilt. Remove cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes longer or until the kale is tender. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Add kale mixture to potatoes and mash until thoroughly combined.In the same heavy skillet used for the kale, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the sausages for 4-5 minutes, until nicely browned on both sides and heated through.Divide the kale-potato mash between 4 or 5 bowls. Arrange sausages on top. Drizzle on a teaspoon of olive oil per bowl and sprinkle with chopped scallions, if you like.

Using your fingertips, rub the vanilla seeds into the sugar until it is evenly distributed. Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the bowl and whisk to combine. 4. Add the cubed butter and, using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is the texture of coarse sand and there are no pieces of butter larger than the size of a pea remaining. Stir the rhubarb and ginger into the mixture, making sure that everything is evenly coated in flour. 5. Pour the heavy cream into the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon, gently stir until all of the cream has been absorbed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times to bring the dough together. 6. Divide the dough in two and pat each into a 7-inch circle. Cut six triangles out of each circle and place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with additional granulated sugar. 7. Bake until the scones are set and golden brown, about 20 t0 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add lard, then meat. Toss to coat meat, and saute just long enough to brown meat on all sides. Remove from heat. Place meat in a 1 quart baking dish. Add carrots, turnip, potatoes, and onion. Mix well.                            Place 1 cup water and ale in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer. Mix cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water until smooth. Slowly pour cornstarch mixture into simmering ale mixture, whisking constantly. Continue to simmer until mixture has thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour mixture over meat and vegetables. Trim puff pastry to fit over top of filling.                            Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until pastry is deep golden brown.
