Set aside.Put the shrimp in a bowl and sprinkle with the Creole seasoning and set aside.In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over med-high heat. Add your sliced onion and saute in olive oil for a few minutes, keep them moving often so they don\u2019t burn.When onions are starting to turn translucent, about 4 minutes or so, add the shrimp and saute the onions and shrimp together for about 5 more minutes.Spread the Creole mayonnaise over both sides of your french bread.Add some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.Spoon the shrimp and onions on the sandwich. Don\u2019t be afraid to get some of the liquid from the shrimp and onions on there\u2026 it seeps into the bread and tastes like heaven.Serve immediately.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
