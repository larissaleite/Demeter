Use a rubber spatula to scrap down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the flour and salt, mixing just until combined.Pat pastry into a 6 inch disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.Remove chilled pastry from the refrigerator and divide into 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place in an ungreased mini muffin pan. Press the pastry against the bottom and up the sides of each cup to form the Tassie shells. Tip: Using one 24-cup or two 12-cup mini muffin pans is ideal. If you have only one smaller pan, keep the extra pastry in the refrigerator until ready to use.Cover filled pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate Tassie shells until firm, at least 30 minutes.While Tassie shells are refrigerating, preheat oven to 350 degrees F, allowing 15 to 20 minutes for the oven to preheat before baking.Bake: Bake 20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown around the edges. Rotate the pans from front to back toward the end of the baking time so the Tassie shells brown evenly. Remove from oven and place on a wire cooling rack to let cool.Run the tip of a small sharp kitchen knife around the edges of the muffin cups to loosen the Tassie shells. Remove shells from pan and place on a serving plate.In a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, lemon juice, water, and butter. Cook until thickened and gently boiling, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon so mixture does not burn, continue cooking for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat.In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with a fork or wire whisk to thoroughly break up the yolk.Temper the eggs: very slowly, in a thin stream, pour about  of the hot lemon mixture into the beaten eggs while quickly whisking together. Tip: The technique used to blend uncooked eggs with a hot liquid is called tempering. Tempering slowly warms the eggs so they are closer to the temperature of the liquid they will be added to, preventing the eggs from scrambling. If you simply poured the eggs into the hot mixture they would immediately start cooking and you would have chunks of cooked egg in the mixture.Return the egg mixture back to the rest of the hot lemon mixture, pouring back slowly while whisking the two mixtures together. Return to medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula and scraping over the bottom of the pan, cook until mixture boils and becomes thick, or registers about 150 degrees using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. Remove from heat.Cover the surface with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the top of the filling so a film does not develop.

surface, mais pas sur toute la surface ; voir la photo ci-dessous. Lorsqu'il fait une temp\u00e9rature normale, mon levain atteint ce stade 6 heures apr\u00e8s un repas o\u00f9 je lui ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s son poids en farine et son poids en eau.(Je pars donc avec 65 g de levain, auxquels j'ajoute 70 g de farine et 70 g d'eau, ce qui me donne 205 g de levain m\u00fbr. Les 5 grammes servent de marge pour compenser ce qui reste sur les parois du bol et sur la spatule.)Dans un grand saladier, ou dans le bol de votre robot-p\u00e9trin, m\u00e9langez les farines, l'eau, le levain et le gluten, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que toute la farine soit incorpor\u00e9e. (Je me sers du crochet du Kitchen", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Aid pour m\u00e9langer \u00e0 la main d'abord, avant de le fixer au robot que je lance 20 s en vitesse 1, juste pour que tout se m\u00e9lange ; vous pouvez utiliser un fouet danois ou une simple cuill\u00e8re en bois.)Laissez reposer 20 \u00e0 40 minutes. C'est la phase d'autolyse, qui permet \u00e0 la farine d'absorber un maximum d'eau avant que le grand m\u00e9chant sel n'arrive.Ajoutez le sel et p\u00e9trissez avec le crochet \u00e0 basse vitesse pendant 5 minutes. Si vous travaillez \u00e0 la main et que vous trouvez la p\u00e2te trop collante pour la p\u00e9trir, vous pouvez vous contenter de la plier sur elle-m\u00eame avec la corne, comme sur cette vid\u00e9o, pendant 7 minutes.Couvrez le bol d'un torchon et laissez reposer la p\u00e2te \u00e0 temp\u00e9rature ambiante pendant 1 heure. Au bout d'une heure, pliez la p\u00e2te (comme sur cette vid\u00e9o) une douzaine de fois. Ceci permet de d\u00e9velopper les ar\u00f4mes et d'obtenir une belle mie. Remettez le torchon.Laissez reposer 1 heure de plus et pliez la p\u00e2te \u00e0 nouveau comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus.D\u00e9posez un morceau de film plastique sur la p\u00e2te, et mettez une charlotte de douche autour du bol. Enfoncez la charlotte pour retirer l'air, jusqu'\u00e0 toucher le film plastique. Mettez au frais 12 \u00e0 24 heures. (Note : lorsque j'ai termin\u00e9, je laisse s\u00e9cher le film plastique pour que les petites particules de p\u00e2te s'enl\u00e8vent facilement, et je garde le film plastique pour m'en resservir la fois suivante.)Retirez le bol du r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur. La p\u00e2te devrait avoir \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s doubl\u00e9 de volume.Retirez le plastique et remplacez-le par un torchon. Laissez la p\u00e2te revenir \u00e0 temp\u00e9rature environ 1 heure.Mettez une pierre \u00e0 pizza carr\u00e9e ou rectangulaire \u00e0 mi-hauteur dans le four. Pr\u00e9chauffez-le \u00e0 300\u00b0C (ou, si votre four ne monte pas si haut, \u00e0 sa temp\u00e9rature maximale) pendant 30 minutes. Si vous n'avez pas de pierre \u00e0 pizza, pr\u00e9chauffez le four \u00e0 240\u00b0C et pr\u00e9parez une plaque \u00e0 p\u00e2tisserie que vous recouvrirez de papier sulfuris\u00e9 si elle n'est pas anti-adh\u00e9sive.Pr\u00e9parez un torchon de lin que vous r\u00e9serverez pour la boulange et farinez-le bien. On appelle ce tissu la couche. (Il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de le laver ensuite ; plus vous l'utiliserez, plus il sera satur\u00e9 de farine, moins la p\u00e2te pourra attacher.)Renversez la p\u00e2te sur une surface g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement farin\u00e9e en vous aidant de la corne pour la faire sortir du bol (j'utilise un vieux tapis de cuisson en silicone bien farin\u00e9). Divisez la p\u00e2te en 4 p\u00e2tons de tailles similaires ; ce n'est pas \u00e9vident \u00e0 faire \u00e0 l'oeil, mais vous pouvez corriger \u00e0 la balance apr\u00e8s si vous voulez.Fa\u00e7onnez chaque p\u00e2ton en un boudin, comme dans la premi\u00e8re partie de cette vid\u00e9o. Laissez reposer 5 \u00e0 10 minutes.Roulez chaque boudin sur lui-m\u00eame pour en allonger la forme, sans d\u00e9passer la largeur de votre pierre \u00e0 pizza (ou plaque de cuisson). Apr\u00e8s avoir fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 chaque baguette, d\u00e9posez-la sur la couche, en formant un pli dans le tissu de part et d'autre pour soutenir la forme (voir la photo ci-dessous). Couvrez d'un torchon et laissez reposer pendant le temps de pr\u00e9chauffage restant.Pendant les 5 derni\u00e8res minutes de pr\u00e9chauffage, ins\u00e9rez une l\u00e8che-frite (= une plaque de four avec rebords) \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage le plus bas du four. Amenez environ 400 ml d'eau \u00e0 \u00e9bullition dans la bouilloire. Juste avant d'enfourner les baguettes, assurez-vous d'avoir un v\u00eatement \u00e0 manches longues, mettez une manique \u00e9paisse, et versez la moiti\u00e9 de l'eau bouillante dans la l\u00e8che-frite -- l'eau va bouillir et d\u00e9gager une grande quantit\u00e9 de vapeur, c'est un peu impressionnant -- avant de refermer rapidement la porte du four.Ceci va cr\u00e9er un environnement bien humide qui favorisera la formation d'une belle cro\u00fbte. Faites vraiment attention de ne pas vous br\u00fbler (d'o\u00f9 les manches longues et la manique) et pour cette \u00e9tape, faites sortir de la cuisine les enfants et les animaux familiers.Si vous utilisez une pierre \u00e0 pizza, placez 2 des baguettes sur une pelle \u00e0 pizza bien farin\u00e9e ; si les p\u00e2tons ne sont pas tout \u00e0 fait de la m\u00eame taille, commencez par les deux plus gros. Faites trois incisions sur le dessus d'un geste d\u00e9termin\u00e9, en tenant la lame \u00e0 un angle de 45\u00b0. D\u00e9posez-les sur la pierre \u00e0 pizza, en travaillant rapidement (mais sans pr\u00e9cipitation) pour que le four reste ouvert le moins de temps possible.Recommencez avec les 2 autres baguettes. Versez le reste de l'eau bouillante dans la l\u00e8che-frite et baissez la temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 220\u00b0C.Si vous n'avez pas de pierre \u00e0 pizza, mettez les 4 baguettes sur la plaque de cuisson. Incisez-les comme indiqu\u00e9 plus haut et enfournez \u00e0 mi-hauteur. Versez le reste de l'eau dans la l\u00e8che-frite, mais ne baissez pas la temp\u00e9rature.Laissez cuire 20 \u00e0 25 minutes, en permutant les baguettes au bout de 15 minutes de telle sorte que celles qui \u00e9taient dans le fond du four soient plus pr\u00e8s de la porte et vice versa, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles soient brun-dor\u00e9 sur le dessus et le dessous. Lorsqu'on tape au-dessous, \u00e7a doit sonner creux. Si la couleur est bonne mais que vous craignez qu'elles ne soient pas tout \u00e0 fait cuites \u00e0 coeur, vous pouvez les laisser 5 \u00e0 10 minutes de plus dans le four \u00e9teint.Laissez refroidir une heure sur grille avant de les go\u00fbter.", "number": 2, "ingredients": []}], "name": ""}], "aggregateLikes": 12, "instructions": "Le levain est pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 lorsqu'il para\u00eet un peu gonfl\u00e9, et que des bulles sont apparues \u00e0 la surface, mais pas sur toute la surface ; voir la photo ci-dessous. Lorsqu'il fait une temp\u00e9rature normale, mon levain atteint ce stade 6 heures apr\u00e8s un repas o\u00f9 je lui ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s son poids en farine et son poids en eau.(Je pars donc avec 65 g de levain, auxquels j'ajoute 70 g de farine et 70 g d'eau, ce qui me donne 205 g de levain m\u00fbr. Les 5 grammes servent de marge pour compenser ce qui reste sur les parois du bol et sur la spatule.)Dans un grand saladier, ou dans le bol de votre robot-p\u00e9trin, m\u00e9langez les farines, l'eau, le levain et le gluten, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que toute la farine soit incorpor\u00e9e. (Je me sers du crochet du KitchenAid pour m\u00e9langer \u00e0 la main d'abord, avant de le fixer au robot que je lance 20 s en vitesse 1, juste pour que tout se m\u00e9lange ; vous pouvez utiliser un fouet danois ou une simple cuill\u00e8re en bois.)Laissez reposer 20 \u00e0 40 minutes. C'est la phase d'autolyse, qui permet \u00e0 la farine d'absorber un maximum d'eau avant que le grand m\u00e9chant sel n'arrive.Ajoutez le sel et p\u00e9trissez avec le crochet \u00e0 basse vitesse pendant 5 minutes. Si vous travaillez \u00e0 la main et que vous trouvez la p\u00e2te trop collante pour la p\u00e9trir, vous pouvez vous contenter de la plier sur elle-m\u00eame avec la corne, comme sur cette vid\u00e9o, pendant 7 minutes.Couvrez le bol d'un torchon et laissez reposer la p\u00e2te \u00e0 temp\u00e9rature ambiante pendant 1 heure. Au bout d'une heure, pliez la p\u00e2te (comme sur cette vid\u00e9o) une douzaine de fois. Ceci permet de d\u00e9velopper les ar\u00f4mes et d'obtenir une belle mie. Remettez le torchon.Laissez reposer 1 heure de plus et pliez la p\u00e2te \u00e0 nouveau comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus.D\u00e9posez un morceau de film plastique sur la p\u00e2te, et mettez une charlotte de douche autour du bol. Enfoncez la charlotte pour retirer l'air, jusqu'\u00e0 toucher le film plastique. Mettez au frais 12 \u00e0 24 heures. (Note : lorsque j'ai termin\u00e9, je laisse s\u00e9cher le film plastique pour que les petites particules de p\u00e2te s'enl\u00e8vent facilement, et je garde le film plastique pour m'en resservir la fois suivante.)Retirez le bol du r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur. La p\u00e2te devrait avoir \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s doubl\u00e9 de volume.Retirez le plastique et remplacez-le par un torchon. Laissez la p\u00e2te revenir \u00e0 temp\u00e9rature environ 1 heure.Mettez une pierre \u00e0 pizza carr\u00e9e ou rectangulaire \u00e0 mi-hauteur dans le four. Pr\u00e9chauffez-le \u00e0 300\u00b0C (ou, si votre four ne monte pas si haut, \u00e0 sa temp\u00e9rature maximale) pendant 30 minutes. Si vous n'avez pas de pierre \u00e0 pizza, pr\u00e9chauffez le four \u00e0 240\u00b0C et pr\u00e9parez une plaque \u00e0 p\u00e2tisserie que vous recouvrirez de papier sulfuris\u00e9 si elle n'est pas anti-adh\u00e9sive.Pr\u00e9parez un torchon de lin que vous r\u00e9serverez pour la boulange et farinez-le bien. On appelle ce tissu la couche. (Il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de le laver ensuite ; plus vous l'utiliserez, plus il sera satur\u00e9 de farine, moins la p\u00e2te pourra attacher.)Renversez la p\u00e2te sur une surface g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement farin\u00e9e en vous aidant de la corne pour la faire sortir du bol (j'utilise un vieux tapis de cuisson en silicone bien farin\u00e9). Divisez la p\u00e2te en 4 p\u00e2tons de tailles similaires ; ce n'est pas \u00e9vident \u00e0 faire \u00e0 l'oeil, mais vous pouvez corriger \u00e0 la balance apr\u00e8s si vous voulez.Fa\u00e7onnez chaque p\u00e2ton en un boudin, comme dans la premi\u00e8re partie de cette vid\u00e9o. Laissez reposer 5 \u00e0 10 minutes.Roulez chaque boudin sur lui-m\u00eame pour en allonger la forme, sans d\u00e9passer la largeur de votre pierre \u00e0 pizza (ou plaque de cuisson). Apr\u00e8s avoir fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 chaque baguette, d\u00e9posez-la sur la couche, en formant un pli dans le tissu de part et d'autre pour soutenir la forme (voir la photo ci-dessous). Couvrez d'un torchon et laissez reposer pendant le temps de pr\u00e9chauffage restant.Pendant les 5 derni\u00e8res minutes de pr\u00e9chauffage, ins\u00e9rez une l\u00e8che-frite (= une plaque de four avec rebords) \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage le plus bas du four. Amenez environ 400 ml d'eau \u00e0 \u00e9bullition dans la bouilloire. Juste avant d'enfourner les baguettes, assurez-vous d'avoir un v\u00eatement \u00e0 manches longues, mettez une manique \u00e9paisse, et versez la moiti\u00e9 de l'eau bouillante dans la l\u00e8che-frite -- l'eau va bouillir et d\u00e9gager une grande quantit\u00e9 de vapeur, c'est un peu impressionnant -- avant de refermer rapidement la porte du four.Ceci va cr\u00e9er un environnement bien humide qui favorisera la formation d'une belle cro\u00fbte. Faites vraiment attention de ne pas vous br\u00fbler (d'o\u00f9 les manches longues et la manique) et pour cette \u00e9tape, faites sortir de la cuisine les enfants et les animaux familiers.Si vous utilisez une pierre \u00e0 pizza, placez 2 des baguettes sur une pelle \u00e0 pizza bien farin\u00e9e ; si les p\u00e2tons ne sont pas tout \u00e0 fait de la m\u00eame taille, commencez par les deux plus gros. Faites trois incisions sur le dessus d'un geste d\u00e9termin\u00e9, en tenant la lame \u00e0 un angle de 45\u00b0. D\u00e9posez-les sur la pierre \u00e0 pizza, en travaillant rapidement (mais sans pr\u00e9cipitation) pour que le four reste ouvert le moins de temps possible.Recommencez avec les 2 autres baguettes. Versez le reste de l'eau bouillante dans la l\u00e8che-frite et baissez la temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 220\u00b0C.Si vous n'avez pas de pierre \u00e0 pizza, mettez les 4 baguettes sur la plaque de cuisson. Incisez-les comme indiqu\u00e9 plus haut et enfournez \u00e0 mi-hauteur. Versez le reste de l'eau dans la l\u00e8che-frite, mais ne baissez pas la temp\u00e9rature.Laissez cuire 20 \u00e0 25 minutes, en permutant les baguettes au bout de 15 minutes de telle sorte que celles qui \u00e9taient dans le fond du four soient plus pr\u00e8s de la porte et vice versa, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles soient brun-dor\u00e9 sur le dessus et le dessous.
