It will take a few minutes, so be patient. Keep stirring until the sugar is absorbed into the butter and looks smooth, 5-8 minutes.Add the slivered almonds.

The mixture will turn a golden, caramel color.Please, please get a thermometer if youre making any kind of candy. Its very hard to tell the perfect temperature just by looking at it. If you undercook the candy, it will be a horrid texture and will probably stick to your teeth and you just might pull out a couple fillings. If you overcook it, it will become bitter and theres no fixing it, unless you start all over again.Add the vanilla.As soon as the candy is the correct temperature, pour it out onto the prepared baking sheet and quickly smooth it out. Set it aside at room temperature to cool and harden, 30 minutes to an hour.Meanwhile, melt the chocolate over a water bath. You can use any chocolate that you like. I prefer milk chocolate, but you can use dark chocolate if thats what you like. When the toffee has cooled, pour the melted chocolate over its surface and smooth it out.

milk. Blend for 30 seconds. Add remaining ingredients except for coconut oil. Blend for several minutes, until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Blend in the coconut oil. Transfer to a container, and refrigerate overnight.CrepesCombine all ingredients in a blender and process for about one minute, until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain. If necessary, scrape down the sides of the blender and process again. Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Brush a small amount of coconut oil onto the skillet. While holding the skillet away from the heat, quickly pour about 3 tablespoons of the crepe batter onto the skillet, tilting it so that the batter coats the bottom. Return the skillet to the stovetop. Allow the crepe to cook for about 2 minutes, or until set. Carefully lift the crepe with a rubber spatula, grab it by your fingertips, and gently (but quickly!) flip it over. Allow the opposite side to cook for 30-60 seconds, until just golden. Remove the crepe from the pan and transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining crepe batter, stacking the finished crepes.At this point, the crepes can be covered and refrigerated until ready to use, up to a day in advance. However, I find that the crepes roll better when warm or room temperature, so if you have refrigerated the crepes, you might try warming them up in the microwave before filling.Caramelized Fig and Orange CompoteHeat the coconut oil over medium-low heat until melted. Add the figs and coconut sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, or until figs are softened. Add the orange juice and zest and increase heat to medium-high. Simmer until the fruit is very softened and the liquid is thick and syrupy, 3-4 minutes.AssemblyPlace a few tablespoons of cannole filling along the lower half of each crepe, and roll it up, burrito style, folding in the sides. Serve immediately, or transfer crepes to a baking dish, seam-side down. Again, the filled crepes can be refrigerated, covered, for up to one day.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray two 24-cup mini muffin tins with cooking spray.Place the russets into a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until halfway done, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, then use a kitchen towel to carefully remove skins. Let cool for 15 minutes.Grate the par-cooked russets into a large bowl. Grate the red potatoes and add them to the bowl as well. Add the salt, pepper, flour and olive oil. Gently combine by hand.Scoop one tablespoon of the potato mixture into each muffin cup, pressing flat with your fingers. Bake until brown at the edges, 15 minutes, then flip so that each side gets golden brown! Spray the tops with more nonstick spray and sprinkle with salt. Return to the oven and bake until browned, another 12 to 15 minutes.Serve with ketchup and mustard for dipping.

Serve with crusty bread, if desired.Photograph by Antonis Achilleos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lemon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Lunch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Pasta Dishes                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li ><a href=\"/content/food/topics/l/lemon.html\">Lemon</a></li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/c/cheese.html\">Cheese</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li ><a href=\"/content/food/topics/e/easy-lunch.html\">Lunch</a></li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/m/main-dish.html\">Main Dish</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/s/stuffed-shells-recipes.html\">Pasta Dishes</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lemon-pepper-fettuccine-317246", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 20, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lemons and Anchovies", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Penne-with-Roasted-Shiitake-Mushrooms--Eggplant-and-Sambal-568764.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 568764, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Penne with Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms, Eggplant and Sambal", "creditText": "Lemons and Anchovies", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 eggplants, cubed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "eggplants", "metaInformation": ["cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/eggplant.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11209, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped (you can use any other fresh herb you like)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh oregano", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped", "canned", "(you can use any other herb you like)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1002027, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 cloves garlic, sliced thinly", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1 -

In separate bowls, toss the eggplant cubes in olive oil, salt and pepper (and white balsamic vinegar, if using. I like to add this just for help with caramelization but you can omit). Do the same for the mushrooms in another bowl but without the vinegar. Be a bit more generous with the salt and olive oil here since the two absorb a lot of oil and the salt brings out their flavor. In separate baking sheets, arrange the eggplants and mushroom slices in a single layer. You can line your sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.Roast the mushrooms for about 7 minutes or until they are golden. Remove from the oven and set aside. The eggplants will need a bit more time, about 20-25 minutes total.To prepare the pasta, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook until al dente.While the pasta is cooking and when the eggplants are done, Saut\u00e9 the garlic and chopped oregano over medium heat in a skillet. I like the garlic to have a more pronounced flavor here so I cooked it for about 3 minutes; just be careful so that it doesn't burn.After about three minutes, the garlic should be quite fragrant. Add the sambal. Try it with one teaspoon first. This will add some kick but the dish won't be hot. I used 1\u00bd tablespoons to suit our taste. The sambal will sizzle and the oil will turn a reddish color. When it starts simmering, add the chicken stock (or pasta water) and lemon juice. When the mixture starts simmering again, add the mushrooms, eggplants and pasta. Turn off the heat.

"instructions": "For the chicken:1Remove the tenders from the chicken breasts and cut off the thinner triangular bottom pieces. Split the remaining thick ends in half. You should end up with about 8 pieces, 1/4 to 1/3 inch in thickness. Toss in a bowl with the salt and lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 hours.2Make the marinade by combining all the remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Use a whisk or immersion blender to mix well.3Drain the chicken (discard the lemon juice) and add it to the yogurt marinade, coating the pieces well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or as long as overnight.For the sauce:1Toast and grind the spices: Combine the cinnamon, cloves, fenugreek, green cardamom pods, and black cardamom pod (if using) in a small saucepan. Toast over medium heat, tossing or stirring occasionally, until the spices are fragrant and hot, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder and process until fine. Transfer to a small bowl and add the smoked paprika (if using in place of the black cardamom).2Melt the butter in a heavy 1-1/2-quart saucepan over medium heat. When it starts to bubble, add the ground spices and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger, garlic, and salt and cook until the butter foams again, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium low and add the tomato paste, using a small whisk to blend it into the butter mixture. Add the water in 2 additions, whisking until smooth. Simmer until the mixture is a pale brick red, about 3 minutes.3Whisk in the cream and simmer until shiny and the volume of the sauce has reduced by a quarter, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.To assemble:1To cook the chicken, heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and lightly brush it with vegetable oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade, let any excess drip off, and place the pieces in the grill pan (you will probably have to do this in batches). Cook until the chicken has dark grill marks and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes on the first side and about 3 minutes on the second. Remove to a platter until all the pieces are cooked and cool enough to handle.2Bring the sauce back to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cut the chicken into 3/4-inch squares and add it to the sauce, along with any juices from the platter. Simmer until the sauce is shiny and has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Serve with basmati rice.

tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic, serrano and anchovy paste and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the capers and olives and stir around to combine. Add the tomatoes, toss to combine, cover, and cook, shaking occasionally, until the tomatoes are cooked through and softened, about 15 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine and stir to pick up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the sliced calamari, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook just until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes (do not overcook). Add the marjoram and lemon juice and toss to combine. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the butter and stir until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the raviolo: Combine the calamari tentacles, basil, parsley, lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper in a food processor; pulse for 5 seconds. Scrape down the sides and pulse for another 5 seconds. With the machine running, add the cream in a steady stream. Transfer to a bowl and fold in the ham hock and Parmesan.Place 1 pasta sheet on a work surface. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the filling evenly down the sheet, about 4 inches apart. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the areas around the filling with egg wash. Lay another pasta sheet on top and press down around each mound of filling to seal and squeeze out air pockets. With a 4-inch round cutter, cut into individual raviolos.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the raviolos and cook until almost done, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a spider, transfer the raviolos to the puttanesca sauce along with 1 ounce of the pasta water and finish cooking in the sauce, reducing to the proper consistency, another minute.Add two raviolos to each plate and spoon sauce over the top. Garnish with basil, parsley and marjoram.

Spray a baking sheet or glass dish with nonstick spray and place the pork loin inside. Scoop up any marinade left in the bowl and paste it over the meat. Roast for about 40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.While the pork is roasting, make the sauce. Mince up the shallots and cook them in a skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil until they are soft. Add the bouillon, water, 2 Tbsp of dijon and thyme. Let simmer for about 10 minutes (volume will reduce during this time). Turn off the heat then whisk in the sour cream. Season with fresh black pepper.Let the pork rest for at least 5 minutes after you take it out of the oven to let the juices redistribute. Slice on an angle into medallions about .75 inch thick.

Finely grate 1 teaspoon of zest from the lemon; set aside.  Squeeze the juice of the lemon into a medium bowl. Whisk in the milk, sugar, and cayenne until the sugar and cayenne are dissolved. Add the sprigs of rosemary and garlic. Pierce each chicken piece several times with a fork, add to the milk mixture, turning to coat well. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Lay the bread on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake, turning a few times, until the bread is crisp and dry, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool completely. Break into large pieces and pulse in the bowl of a food processor until it forms coarse crumbs.3. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. In a shallow dish combine the bread crumbs with the corn meal, Parmesan (if using), chopped rosemary, reserved 1 teaspoon zest, and season with salt and pepper. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a wire rack. Coat the rack well with nonstick cooking spray.4. Working with one piece at a time, remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing the excess to drip off. Press into the bread crumb mixture until the chicken is well coated and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken and crumbs. Mist the chicken with nonstick cooking spray.5. Bake until the chicken is crisp and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 160 degrees F, about 50 to 55 minutes.

Repeat with remaining eggplant until all chips are made.Before placing in the oven, give the chips a quick spritz of cooking spray - this will help them get ultra crispy in the oven. Bake on the center rack for 20 - 30 minutes until crispy. Flip half way through to ensure even cooking.Let cool completely before storing.

Stamp out lots of different sized circles using a selection of round and fluted biscuit cutters of 4cm, 5cm and 6cm diameter. Brush a little milk over the surface of the biscuits, and prick all over with a fork. Start to arrange in a circle on the baking sheet, overlapping each other. If you want to serve a cheese in the centre, check that it will fit. Scatter over a few more fennel and poppy seeds and bake for 15 - 20 mins until the biscuits feel dry and sandy with a slightly golden colour around the edges - they may still feel soft but will harden up when cooling.

the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes.                                                                Add the butter to the flour mixture and toss to evenly coat. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender, a food processor, an electric mixer, or your hands, just until the mixture becomes coarse and crumbly and the butter is the size of peas. Stir the water and lemon juice together, then pour over the dry ingredients and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened.                                                                Dump the dough onto a well-floured work surface and press it into a 6-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.                                                                Roll the chilled dough into a 14-inch disk, then line a 9 or 10 by 3-inch springform pan with the rolled-out dough. Patch any holes and trim off any dough that hangs over the edges of the pan. Chill for an additional 30 minutes while you prepare the crumb topping and the fruit filling.                                                                            To make the walnut crumb topping, mix the flour, brown sugar, walnuts, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in the butter, then work it in with your hands until the texture of crumbs. Put the topping in the refrigerator while you make the fruit filling.                                                                Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.                                                                            To make the fruit filling, remove the stem from each fig, then boil the figs in 1 cup of water for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.                                                                Slice each fig into 4 to 5 pieces, put them in a large bowl, and add the apples, pears, and cranberries. Separately, rub the sugar and cornstarch together, then add to the fruit and gently toss until evenly coated.                                                                Transfer the filling to the pie shell and top with the walnut crumb. Bake in the lower third of the oven for 60 to 75 minutes, or until the crumb is golden, the fruit juices are bubbling thickly around the edges, and the fruit is tender when pierced with a wooden skewer. If the crumb is getting too dark, cover it with foil.                                                                Storage: Covered with a tea towel, the pie will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days. Spooned into a bowl and drizzled with chilled cream, it makes a wonderful breakfast.

Dust the top of the pastry lightly with flour and roll out until the dough is just a little thinner.Cut 2\" circles out of the dough and place on the prepared baking sheets.Using a Tablespoon measure(or something else that is circular and about 1 inch in diameter), make an indent in the center of each puff pastry circle, not pressing all the way through the dough.. *This step is crucial in making sure that your tartlet's have a crust that puffs up around the toppings instead of the whole tart puffing up and pushing the toppings off.Add a heaping teaspoon of the onion mixture to the center of each puff pastry circle. Make a well in the center of the onion mixture, pressing around the center indent, but not outside of it.Bake the tarts in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until just turning golden brown.Remove from the oven and place a cube of cheese in the center of each tart.Place back in the oven and bake for another minute or two, just until the cheese has melted.Remove and drizzle a little honey over each tartlet.Add a leaf of tarragon to each tartlet and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/caramelized-onion-cranberry-swiss-tartlets-621419", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Quick-beef---broccoli-noodles-218354.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 218354, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Quick beef & broccoli noodles", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "400g pack beef stir-fry strips", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "beef stir fry meat", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 400.0, "id": 23572, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 head broccoli, cut into small florets", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "broccoli", "metaInformation": ["small", "cut into  florets"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broccoli.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11090, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "3 blocks egg noodles", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "egg noodles", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-noodles.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20409, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 thumb-sized knob ginger, peeled and finely grated", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["finely grated", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp low-salt soy sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "low sodium soy sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 16424, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp oyster sauce (not oyster stir-fry sauce)", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "oyster sauce", "metaInformation": ["(not oyster stir-fry sauce)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oyster-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6176, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp sesame oil", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sesame oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4058, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "sliced spring onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "spring onion", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11291, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp tomato ketchup", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "tomato ketchup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ketchup.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11935, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp white wine vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "white wine vinegar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002068, "unit": "tbsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 91.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3452/quick-beef-and-broccoli-noodles", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "aggregateLikes": 231, "instructions": "Start by making up the sauce.
