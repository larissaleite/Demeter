butter, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, apples, pears and a tiny pinch of salt. Cook while stirring until the fruit is tender, but still has a bit of a bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove to a plate or bowl and place in the freezer or refrigerator until cold.In a large bowl, add the softened ice cream and chilled fruit and stir until combined. Place in an airtight container and return to the freezer until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Place a parchment-lined baking sheet in the freezer to chill as well.For the coating and frying: In a bowl, add the cereal, pecans and a pinch of salt and stir to combine. In another bowl, add the eggs and 2 tablespoons water and whisk. Refrigerate the egg wash until needed, returning it to the refrigerator when not in use.Remove the ice cream from the freezer. Using an ice cream scoop, make 1 ball of ice cream (if you use your hands to make it perfect, do it fast!) and quickly roll it in the cereal coating. Place it on the baking sheet in the freezer and repeat for the remaining balls. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.Remove the egg wash from the fridge and, one by one, dunk and coat each ball in it. Then roll again in the cereal coating, returning each ball to the freezer immediately after rolling in the cereal coating. Freeze this time about 30 minutes.Repeat the egg wash and cereal coating again, freezing the final time a full 2 hours or overnight. (Perfect to prep the day before!)Fill a heavy pot or deep fryer about halfway with oil and bring to 375 degrees F. Drop a few ice cream balls in directly from the freezer and cook golden brown, about 1 minute. Timing depends on the batch and ball size, so watch the pot! Roll on a paper-towel-lined plate to quickly remove any excess oil. Serve immediately after frying.

pressure cookerAdd the goat meat, allspice, seasoning salt, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 tablespoon grated ginger and 3 cups water to a pressure cooker. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.On the stovetop in a deep pot, add the oil, curry powder, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 tablespoon grated ginger and cook over low heat until all the ingredients combine together in a paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the scallions and habanero peppers and let simmer 2 to 3 minutes.Add the goat and cooking liquid to the curry paste. Add more water if necessary, and simmer until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Be careful not to overcook as the meat will get mushy and fall apart.Add the potatoes to the meat mixture and simmer until the goat is tender and the potatoes are cooked, about 1/2 hour more. Serve hot with accompaniments.                                                                    Professional Recipe: This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and makes a large quantity. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe in the proportions indicated and therefore cannot make any representation as to the results.                                                    Cook's Note: It is better to have the goat cut when partially frozen to avoid splintering of the bones. Allow each pound goat to cook under pressure for about 10 minutes. If the goat is cooked before serving time, turn off the heat and allow the flavors to mix, then reheat before serving.

Add the onion, carrot and celery and saute for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and mostly cooked through. Add the garlic and mushrooms and continue cooking for an additional 4-5 minutes until the mushrooms are browned, and all of the vegetables are completely cooked through.Pour in the wine, and give the mixture a good stir. Let the mixture come to a boil and simmer for about 2-3 minutes, or until the wine is reduced by about half.Add in the vegetable stock, tomato sauce, bay leaf, Italian seasoning, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Let the mixture continue cooking until it comes to simmer. Then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncover for about 10 minutes so that it slightly reduces.Taste, and season with extra salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and/or crushed red pepper if needed.Once the pasta is cooked and drained, combine it with the sauce and toss until combined.

oil, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons Essence in a re-sealable, 1-gallon plastic bag. Let marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat a grill pan to high heat. Remove the chicken from the plastic bag, and place on a platter. Season the chicken on both sides with the remaining Essence salt and pepper. Place the chicken, smooth side down, on the grill and cook for 4 minutes, rotate 45 degrees and cook an additional 4 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook for another 4 minutes on the second side, or until cooked through. You can choose to baste the chicken with the marinade but you need to either: baste the chicken and continue cooking the chicken a little bit longer on each side or you need to bring the marinade up to a boil for at least 5 minutes and then you can baste the chicken.  Remove from the heat and serve with the Couscous and Sauteed Cremini Mushrooms.

Published by William Morrow, 1993.                                                Couscous:                                        Set a 1-quart saucepan over high heat and add the water, red onions, carrots and currants. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. While the water boils, combine the remaining ingredients except the mint in a medium heat-proof bowl. Pour the water over the couscous in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to steam for 5 minutes, remove the plastic, add the mint and fluff with a fork. Serve hot.Yield: about 4 cups                                                Sauteed Cremini Mushrooms:                                        Set a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and once melted, add the shallots and garlic to the pan. Cook for 1 minute, then add the mushrooms, thyme, salt and pepper. Continue to cook the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, 7 to 8 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the balsamic vinegar and continue to cook until the vinegar has reduced by 1/2, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve the mushrooms spooned over the chicken and couscous.Yield: about 1 1/2 cups                                                    Recipe courtesy of Emeril Lagasse, 2007

oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners, and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray.Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet, and bake until nicely toasted, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Set aside 12 nice halves as garnish, then pulse the remaining pecans in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer the ground pecans to a medium bowl. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, and whisk to combine; set aside.Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition. Scrape down the side of the bowl once or twice as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Adjust the speed to low, and add half the flour mixture, then the sour cream, then the remaining flour mixture until just combined.Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Bake until the edges are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 24 minutes, rotating the tin halfway through. Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cupcakes can be made 1 day ahead and stored at room temperature in an airtight container.)For the frosting: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until the milk solids have turned golden brown and the butter smells toasty, about 10 minutes. Pour the butter into a shallow baking dish, and refrigerate until it's solid but still soft enough that your finger leaves an indentation, about 25 minutes. Scrape the cooled butter into a large bowl (be sure not to leave any brown bits in the skillet), and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. While continuing to beat, add the corn syrup, and beat until incorporated. Scrape down the side of the bowl. Adjust the speed to medium-low, add the confectioners' sugar and salt, and beat until smooth. Use right away or keep for up to 2 hours at room temperature in an airtight container.To assemble: Divide the frosting evenly among the cupcakes, and use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to swirl. Top each cupcake with a teaspoonful of dulce de leche and 1 of the reserved toasted pecans.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

sides of a 9-inch square baking pan with vegetable oil. Using a small, fine-mesh sieve, dust the pan generously with confectioners' sugar, knocking out any excess.                                                                In a medium bowl, whisk together cocoa powder, malted milk powder, 3 tablespoons corn syrup, and 1 tablespoon hot water. Set aside.                                                                 Put 1/2 cup water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Sprinkle the gelatin into the bowl and stir briefly to make sure all the gelatin is in contact with water. Let soften while you make the sugar syrup.                                                                In a heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan, combine the granulated sugar, the remaining cup of corn syrup, salt, and 1/2 cup water. Place over moderate heat and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Put a candy thermometer into the boiling sugar syrup and continue boiling (the mixture may foam up, so turn the heat down slightly if necessary), without stirring, until the thermometer registers 240\u00b0F (soft-ball stage). Remove the saucepan from the heat and let stand briefly until the bubbles dissipate slightly.                                                                With the mixer on low speed, pour the hot sugar syrup into the softened gelatin in a thin stream down the side of the bowl. Gradually increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the marshmallow is very thick and forms a thick ribbon when the whisk is lifted, about 5 minutes.                                                                 Working quickly, scoop out about one-third of the marshmallow (it will be very sticky), add it to the chocolate-malt mixture, and fold until fully incorporated. Return to the mixer and beat until fully incorporated, 30 seconds to 1 minute.                                                                 Scrape the marshmallow into the prepared pan (it will be very sticky) and use wet fingertips to spread it evenly and smooth the top. Let stand, uncovered at room temperature, until the surface is no longer sticky and you can gently pull the marshmallow away from the sides of the pan with your fingertips, at least 4 hours or overnight.                                                                 Dust a cutting board with confectioners' sugar. Use a rubber spatula to pull the sides of the marshmallow from the edge of the pan (use the spatula to loosen the marshmallow from the bottom of the pan if necessary) and invert onto the cutting board. Dust the top with confectioners' sugar. Brush a long thin knife or a chef\u2019s knife with vegetable oil and dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar to prevent sticking; continue dusting the knife as necessary. Cut lengthwise into 8 strips, then crosswise into eighths, to form a total of 64 squares. (For larger marshmallows, cut lengthwise into 6 strips, then crosswise into sixths, to form a total of 36 squares.) Coat marshmallows, one at a time, in confectioners' sugar, using a pastry brush to brush off any excess. DO AHEAD: Marshmallows can be stored, layered between sheets of wax paper or parchment in an airtight container in a dry place at cool room temperature, for 1 month.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-malt-marshmallows-212778", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 64, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Jo Cooks", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Smashed-Avocado-Bacon-Breakfast-Sandwiches-559315.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 559315, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Smashed Avocado Bacon Breakfast Sandwiches", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Jo Cooks", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 avocados", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "avocados", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9037, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 slices cheddar cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1009, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "juice from \u00bd lime", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lime", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9160, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "8 slices turkey bacon", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "turkey bacon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon-turkey.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 8.0, "id": 42130, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "4 whole wheat rolls", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "whole wheat rolls", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-wheat-hamburger-buns.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 18351, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 80.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.jocooks.com/healthy-eating/smashed-avocado-bacon-breakfast-sandwiches/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "aggregateLikes": 750, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.

leaving foil overhang on the 2 long sides. Spray the foil with nonstick spray.Stir the butter and chocolate in a large heavy saucepan over very low heat until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and whisk in the sugar, and then the eggs, 1 at a time. Whisk in espresso powder, vanilla, and salt. Then sift the flour over the chocolate mixture and stir to blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan and bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking, and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached. This should take about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on rack.Once cooled, run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. Cut into individual rectangular flag shapes. Mine are approximately 2-1/2'' wide by 1-1/2'' tall.Cook the raspberries in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently until the raspberries are broken down into a sauce. Set up a fine mesh strainer lined with 2 layers of cheese cloth over a bowl. Pour the raspberry sauce over the cheese cloth to remove the seeds. I gather up the ends of the cheese cloth and gently press out all the raspberry juice to get as much juice out as possible. Pour the raspberry juice back in the pan. Simmer a bit until the juice reduces to 2 tablespoons. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool completely.With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add half the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add the rest of the powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Measure out 1 cup of the frosting and set aside. To the remaining frosting in the mixer bowl, add the 2 tablespoons of raspberry sauce. Mix well. This will be used for the red stripes on the flag. If you want the red to be deeper in color, add a little bit of red food coloring. (I did.) Mix well again. If either the white or red frosting seems too stiff, you can add milk, a half teaspoon at a time.Fit a pastry bag with a flat petal tip (I used a Wilton #150 with an opening that is about 1/2'' wide) and fill it with the red frosting. Pipe 2 straight lines, 1 on top and the other on the bottom, onto the brownie, as shown in the pictures. Repeat until all brownies have 2 red stripes.Then fit another pastry bag with the same tip and fill it with the reserved white frosting. Pipe 1 line in between the two red lines, as shown in the pictures. Repeat until all brownies have a white stripe.Remove the flat petal tip from the bag with the white frosting and replace it with a small star tip. Squeeze a small amount of frosting onto the brownie where the blueberry will go, and then stick a blueberry on it. Finish by adding a small star to the top of the blueberry.

Melt the butter in a large microwave safe bowl in 30 second increments until melted. Stir in 1 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, cocoa powder, salt, food coloring, and vinegar.

Add the confectioners' sugar and 2 Tbsp cream, beating on medium until creamy. Add 1 more Tbsp cream until the frosting is spreadable consistency. You want it to be thick so that the frosting layer stays neat when you cut into the brownies. Fold in the crushed Oreos. Lift the cooled brownies out of the pan and spread them with the frosting. Stick them into the refrigerator as your prepare the ganache. You want the frosting to slightly chill on the brownies.Make the ganache: Break up the chocolate into small pieces in a medium bowl. Heat the heavy cream until boiling, either in the microwave or on the stovetop. Pour boiling cream over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Cut in the butter, one small piece at a time, and stir until smooth.

Whisk together the oil, sugar, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce and garlic cloves in a bowl. Add the beef to a baking dish or ziplock bag and pour the marinade ingredients overtop. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or even overnight.When you're ready to cook the beef, heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. (as a note, I do not add the marinade to the skillet - I remove the beef with kitchen tongs and whatever marinade is on the beef comes along. The rest is discarded.) Add the coconut oil and once melted, add the beef in 2 or 3 batches. You don't want to crowd the beef and you only want to cook it for a few minutes so it stays tender. Sear the beef for 1 to 2 minutes, then flip and sear the other side. Remove the beef and place in a bowl - and repeat with remaining beef. Once all of the beef is in the bowl, reduce the heat to medium-high. Add in the peppers and onions and stir well to coat, scraping any bits off the bottom. Cook until the vegetables just start to soften, about 2-3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the beef back to the skillet and toss. Cover and let sit over warm heat for 5 to 10 minutes so the flavors can marry a bit. Serve immediately with the coconut jasmine rice.coconut jasmine riceHeat a saucepan over medium-high heat and add rice, coconut milk, coconut water and salt. Stir, then bring to a boil.

granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Make a hole in the center of the flour mixture and add the pumpkin, ricotta, milk, vanilla and egg yolks and mix gently to combine.In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites with a pinch of salt. Using a mixer or whisk, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks and look very fluffy, like snowdrifts.Using a rubber spatula, scoop a third of the egg whites into the pumpkin batter and fold to gently combine. Repeat this process two more times until all the whites have been added. Do this gently but quickly  the idea is to not squish the air out of the egg whites. This is the secret to keeping the pancakes fluffy!Place a griddle over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, drop a pat or two of butter onto the griddle. Once melted, schmear the butter around and wipe up any excess with a paper towel.Using a 2-ounce ladle, spoon ladlefuls of batter onto the buttered griddle to create 3-inch pancakes. Let the pancakes cook until bubbles appear on the surface, burst, and then stay open  this will take about 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook the second side until golden brown. Re-butter the griddle and repeat until all the batter is gone or everyone is full. Hold the finished pancakes in the warm oven.For the compote: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the apples, cider, cinnamon stick, star anise and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer (BTB, RTS), then continue cooking until the liquid has reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes.Add the maple syrup and raisins. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and serve spooned over the pancakes, dusted with powdered sugar if desired. Try not to eat too many.                                                    \"Own Your Own Kitchen: Recipes to Inspire & Empower\" by Anne Burrell Clarkson Potter 2013.

Let the butter cook until it just starts to brown.Pour the melted butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using an electric mixer).Add the sugars, and beat together until fluffy and well-combined.Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides as needed.Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.Cover, and refrigerate (or freeze if youre in a hurry) for at least 6 hours (or 4 hours in the freezer). If you put the dough in the freezer, you'll need to set it out while the oven preheats.When youre ready to bake the cookies, preheat oven to 350 F. Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.Drop scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheets using a medium cookie scoop (1  tablespoons).Bake for 7-9 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.To make the filling, beat cream cheese and yogurt together until well-combined.Add the vanilla extract, and stir until its incorporated.Add enough powdered sugar to make it spreadable.Once the cookies have cooled, spread half of them with the cream cheese filling.Top with the remaining cookies.Store any leftover cookies in the refrigerator.This recipe makes about 28 cookie sandwiches.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

"instructions": "Heat the grill on medium heat.  Remove the husk and silk from the ears of corn.  Add the ears of corn to the grill and shut the lid on the BBQ.  Every few minutes, open the lid and turn the corn so that it doesn\u2019t sit in one place too long and burn.  Continue turning them every few minutes until the corn turns a dark color in various places on each ear of corn (about 15 minutes).While the corn is grilling, lay the butter in each serving dish, or on a medium size plate.  Then add 3 tablespoons of the crumbled cheese on top of the butter (reserve 1 tablespoon of crumbled cheese for garnish).  Add the pepper on top of the cheese.As soon as the corn is done, while it\u2019s still hot from the grill, lay each ear of corn on top of the butter, cheese, and pepper mixture.

Brush a little oil on each side and sprinkle the top of each fillet with  teaspoon of spice mix. Place 2 fillets, spiced-side down, in the pre-heated skillet. Then sprinkle the top side of each fillet with  teaspoon of spice mix. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes per side, or until spices are blackened and fish is cooked through. Transfer fish to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe the pan clean to avoid a burnt taste. (blackened is not the same as burnt!) Repeat with the other two fillets.Assemble the Tacos: Divide fish, onion-cabbage mixture, and avocado evenly among warmed tortillas.
