In bowl of food processor, combine granulated sugar and grapefruit zest. Process until no large pieces of zest remain, about 30 seconds. Add eggs. Process until thoroughly combined. Add dry ingredients. Pulse until smooth, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add oil and Greek-style yogurt. Run processor until thick batter forms, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides as necessary.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Spoon batter evenly into prepared loaf pan. Bake until golden brown. A cake tester inserted into center of loaf should come out clean or with just a few dry crumbs, about 40 minutes.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            While loaf bakes, prepare glaze. Combine grapefruit juice and granulated sugar in small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until mixture boils and sugar dissolves. Remove from heat.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Remove loaf from oven. Allow to cool in pan for three minutes. Transfer loaf to wire rack set over a plate or pan. Using a long skewer, immediately poke holes all over loaf. (Skewer should reach bottom of loaf.) Brush 1/3 of glaze over top of loaf. Allow loaf to absorb glaze, about 5 minutes. Repeat two more times with remaining glaze. Cool loaf before serving. Wrap and store at room temperature for up to three days or freeze cooled loaf for up to one month.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gluten-free-grapefruit-cake-201799", "dishTypes":

Slow Cooker Method (6 hours 50 minutes):                                        In a large skillet on high heat, add the butter and ground chuck. Season with a pinch of salt and, using a wooden spoon or spatula, break it up into small chunks, not bits. Brown the meat on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes, then remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon to a plate and reserve.Toss the top round cubes in a medium bowl with the flour to coat. Add the cubes to the hot skillet in batches and sear on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove to the plate with the ground beef and reserve.Use twine to tie the thyme, sage and oregano together. Turn the slow cooker to high and add the seared beef, tied herbs, onions, beef stock, red chili flakes, peppercorns, garlic and 1 cup of the beer. Season with another pinch of salt and cover. When the liquid begins to boil, after about 30 minutes, turn the slow cooker to low and cook until the onions are tender, about 4 hours.At the 4-hour mark, add the potatoes, carrots and remaining 1/2 cup beer. Cover and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 2 hours. Skim any fat off the top (see Cook's Note), then spoon the stew atop your choice of serving options. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.                                                Oven Method (8 hours 20 minutes):                                        Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.In a large ovensafe pot or Dutch oven, sear the ground chuck and beef cubes in the butter using the same method as above. Use twine to tie the thyme, sage and oregano together. Add all the meat back to the pot along with the tied herbs, onions, beef stock, red chili flakes, peppercorns, garlic and 1 cup of the beer. Season with a pinch of salt, cover and place in the oven to cook until the onions are tender, about 6 hours.At the 6-hour mark, add the potatoes, carrots and remaining 1/2 cup beer. Cover and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 2 hours. Skim any fat off the top (see Cook's Note), then spoon the stew atop your choice of serving options. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.                                                Stove Top Method (8 hours 30 minutes):                                        In a large pot or Dutch oven, sear the ground chuck and beef cubes in the butter using the same method as above. Load the pot the same as above. Bring to a very low simmer over medium heat, cover and simmer until the onions are tender, about 6 hours.At the 6-hour mark, add the potatoes, carrots and remaining 1/2 cup beer. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 2 hours. Skim any fat off the top (see Cook's Note), then spoon the stew atop your choice of serving options. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.                                                            Cook's Note: You can let the stew cool slightly in the pot or slow cooker sleeve when done, then refrigerate the whole thing overnight. The fat will solidify on top and will be easy to remove once chilled. Then just reheat and top with parsley before serving.
