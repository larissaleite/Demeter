Finally, give the batter a good 2-minute beating to ensure that it is thoroughly mixed and well aerated. Divide the batter evenly into the prepared baking pans and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.Let cakes cool completely in the pans on a wire rack, at least one hour.Remove cakes from pans and place on a piece of plastic wrap.In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, cook the blueberries, 3/4 cup water, and 2 Tbsp sugar, partially covered, until blueberries are softened, about 8 minutes.Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl and discard solids.Whisk berry-flavored gelatin and food coloring into the juices and cool slightly, about 15 minutes.In another medium saucepan over medium-low heat, cook the strawberries, 1/2 cup water and 2 Tbsp sugar, partially covered, until berries are softened, about 15 minutes.Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl and discard solids.Whisk strawberry gelatin into the juices and cool slightly, about 15 minutes.Using a skewer, poke 25 holes in the top of each cake, twisting gently to form larger holes. Pour cooled blueberry syrup over one cake layer.Repeat with cooled strawberry syrup and second cake layer.Cover cakes with plastic wrap and refrigerate until gelatin is set, at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. I put mine in the freezer overnight; I think frozen cake layers are much easier to frost.Make the whipped cream stabilizer by adding the gelatin to the cold water and letting it sit for a minute. Microwave on high for just long enough to become liquid; mine took about 10 seconds then let cool for one minute.In a large chilled bowl, beat cream and sugar until soft peaks form; while mixer is running add stabilizer and mix thoroughly to incorporate. Refrigerate until ready to use.Place blueberry cake, syrup side up, on a platter. Spread 1 cup of whipped cream over top.Place strawberry cake layer, syrup side up, on top of whipped cream. Spread remaining whipped cream over top and sides of cake.Garnish with additional blueberries and strawberries.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/july-4th-red-white-and-blue-patriotic-cake-522759", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Texanerin", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/100-Whole-Grain-Nutella-Swirl-Banana-Muffins-480571.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 22, "id": 480571, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "100% Whole Grain Nutella Swirl Banana Muffins", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 30.41, "creditText": "Texanerin", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 medium super ripe bananas, mashed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "bananas", "metaInformation": ["ripe", "medium", "mashed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9040, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup (80 grams) honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 80.0, "id": 19296, "unit": "grams"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd cups (180 grams) whole spelt, whole wheat pastry, or whole wheat flour", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "spelt", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat", "whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/farro-or-spelt.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 180.0, "id": 20140, "unit": "grams"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 33.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.texanerin.com/2012/03/100-whole-grain-nutella-swirl-banana-muffins.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-tray.jpg", "id": 404671, "name": "muffin tray"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Line 12 muffin tins with liners and preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F / 175\u00b0C.
