Spread the sugar on a baking sheet and let it dry overnight at room temperature.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            For the Marshmallows: You\u2019ll need a Thermapen or other candy thermometer.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Place the gelatin in a bowl of ice water to soften.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Remove the gelatin from the water and squeeze out excess water. Place the gelatin in a small metal bowl set over a small pot of simmering water and melt it (do not let it simmer), then reduce the heat and keep it warm.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds to the egg whites.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Combine the granulated sugar, water, and corn syrup in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then simmer for about 5 minutes, until the syrup reaches 250\u00b0F/121.1\u00b0C, according to the candy thermometer.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Letting the syrup continue to cook, turn the mixer to medium speed. The goal is to have the whites at medium peaks when the syrup reaches 281\u00b0 to 284\u00b0F/138\u00b0 to 140\u00b0C. Should the whites reach stiff peaks before the syrup reaches the proper temperature, reduce the mixer speed to the lowest setting.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            When the syrup reaches 281\u00b0 to 284\u00b0F/138\u00b0 to 140\u00b0C, remove it from the heat. Turn the mixer to medium speed and slowly add the syrup to the egg whites, pouring it between the side of the bowl and the whisk. Pour in the gelatin, increase the speed to medium-high, and mix for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is thickened, glossy, and warm but not hot. Put aside, to be piped into plastic egg molds.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Preparing the Eggs: You\u2019ll need twelve two-piece plastic eggs, a clean egg carton, and a pastry bag with a \u00bd-inch plain tip.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            If the plastic eggs are new, open them, wash them, and dry thoroughly. Spray the inside of both halves of each egg with nonstick spray and set them in the egg carton. Fill the pastry bag with the warm marshmallow mixture.                                                                                                                             11                                                                            Holding the tip close to the bottom of an egg half, slowly pull up as you fill the half completely; try not to leave any air pockets. Fill the other half and fit the top and bottom together\u2014there will be some resistance, but they must be secure to form a perfectly shaped egg.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Wipe off the excess marshmallow that oozes from the egg with a damp paper towel. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Stand the filled eggs in the egg carton and let them sit at room temperature overnight.                                                                                                                            13                                                                            Put the decorating sugar in a small bowl. Remove the eggs from the molds. Toss the eggs in the sugar and then stand them in the egg carton.                                                                                                                            14                                                                            If they will be served within a few hours, let the eggs sit at room temperature.

Cover mixture with remainder of bread flour, all purpose flour, sugar, and salt and let sit for 30 minutes (even though the mixture is dry, it will rise).Add 3 eggs and mix in a stand up mixer with a dough hook on medium speed for about 10 minutes, scraping down the bowl every once in a while. Add the remaining egg and mix for 3 more minutes.Slowly add the butter in pieces, mixing each piece in completely before adding more, scraping down the mixing bowl often.When dough is done, it will be very shiny and elastic. If the dough is not elastic, continue mixing: it will come together!Place dough in a bowl that is big enough to allow it to double in size, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit out at room temperature for 1 \u00bd hours.Fold dough over on itself and then cover again with plastic wrap\u2014chill in refrigerator overnight.Dough is now ready to fry, separate in about 40-1/2 ounce pieces and roll in to balls if you wish. {My batter was too sticky to roll, so I used a small cookie scoop and plopped them right into the hot oil...worked like a charm!} Deep fry in oil about 350 degrees Farrenheit until golden brown and toss in sugar right from the oil. Make sure these take a minute or two to fry so they get completely cooked. My oil was too hot at first and cooked the outside but not the inside. Be sure your oil is at 350! Serve immediately right out of the oil and sugar!

Bake at 350\u00b0 for 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.                                                                                           Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla; beat on low speed just until combined. Pour over crust.                                                                                           Bake for 15-20 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.                                                                                           Place chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream just to a boil. Pour over chocolate; whisk until smooth. Cool, stirring occasionally, to room temperature or until ganache reaches a spreading consistency, about 40 minutes. Spread over top. Refrigerate until firm. Cut into bars. Refrigerate leftovers.                                        Yield: 2 dozen.
