Add the milk, oil, egg, and vanilla, mix for 2 minutes.Slowly add the remaining 1 & 1/4 cups of flour - a stiff dough will result. Stir in the sliced sausage. Grease a regular sized 12-muffin pan, do not use paper liners. Divide the dough evenly among the 12 cups. In a draft free place (I used the inside of my oven, while it was OFF) let the dough rise for 20 minutes. The dough will rise slightly, but not double in size. Remove the muffin pan and let the oven preheat, bake at 375 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes, or until slightly brown. Allow the muffins to cool for 2 minutes, then remove from the pan.

Press the mixture through a fine strainer into a bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic onto the top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate for at least an hour.  But it's best if you can let it refrigerate overnight. For madeleines: Beat the eggs and the sugar together until they are pale and frothy.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and lemon zest.  Mix the honey and the milk with the cooled butter and add it to the eggs. In 2 additions, fold in the flour mixture.  Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to begin baking, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter and flour 2 (12 shell) madeleine tins with softened butter. Use 2 soup spoons (Tablespoons) to scoop a spoonful of batter.
