Set aside.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Wipe out the pan with a paper towel.  No need to be overly thorough.  Add 1/2 stick butter and melt over medium to medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until translucent, 10 or so minutes.                                                                                                                              4                                                                            Add the cabbage to the onion, toss thoroughly with the onion, and cover.  Cook until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes.  Stir occasionally, lowering the heat if the onions are browning too much. (A little browning is okay, but well-done onions will overwhelm the potatoes.)                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.  Dry, shaking the pot, over high heat for about ten seconds.  Turn off the heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter and the half and half, and mash\u2014by hand\u2014to your liking.  I prefer a few lumps myself\u2014remember, this is a country dish.  And salt and pepper to taste, then add even more pepper!                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Preheat broiler.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Dump the cabbage-onion mix into the potatoes and mix thoroughly.  Return the bacon to the pan, distributing more or less evenly.  Scoop the potatoes on top, spreading to cover bacon. Don\u2019t smooth down too much.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Dot the top with remaining butter (you may not need all of it).

Drain the garlic and peel. Set aside.Dry the chicken with paper towels. Season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the butter and oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. In batches, saute the chicken in the fat, skin side down first, until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Turn with tongs or a spatula; you don't want to pierce the skin with a fork. If the fat is burning, turn the heat down to medium. When a batch is done, transfer it to a plate and continue to saute all the chicken in batches. Remove the last chicken to the plate and add all of the garlic to the pot. Lower the heat and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, turning often, until evenly browned. Add 2 tablespoons of the Cognac and the wine, return to a boil, and scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken to the pot with the juices and sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Cover and simmer over the lowest heat for about 30 minutes, until all the chicken is done.Remove the chicken to a platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sauce and the flour and then whisk it back into the sauce in the pot. Raise the heat, add the remaining tablespoon of Cognac and the cream, and boil for 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper, to taste; it should be very flavorful because chicken tends to be bland. Pour the sauce and the garlic over the chicken and serve hot.
