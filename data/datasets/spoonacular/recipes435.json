Stir with a wooden spatula until you have a nice soft dough that\u2019s not sticky. You may need a bit more flour.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Divide the dough in two equal parts, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour to stiffen.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).                                                                                                                             8                                                                            Roll out one ball of dough on a well-floured counter. The dough will be pretty soft, so while rolling, you\u2019ll need to sprinkle more flour over the rolling pin and the dough.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Fit the dough into the pie plate and neatly trim the edges. Crumble the almond paste over the bottom and spread it evenly.                                                                                                                             10                                                                            Spoon all the rhubarb from the bowl into the crust. If there is a lot of liquid in the bowl, leave it behind, or the bottom of the pie will become soggy.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Roll out the other ball of dough and place it over the pie. With a fork, press the edges firmly together. With an apple corer or knife, cut a hole in the center to allow steam to escape from the pie.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Beat the remaining egg white and brush the entire pie with it.                                                                                                                             13                                                                            Bake in the center of the oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until golden brown.
