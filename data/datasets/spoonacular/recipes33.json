This is best done in a stand mixer so you have an extra hand for the next step.Once the tea has steeped in the cream for ten minutes, remove the tea bags and discard.Very, very slowly drizzle \u00bd cup of warm cream into the egg yolks with the mixer beating the yolks on medium-low speed.

You want to get an even layer of sugar over the whole surface, so you may need to tilt, wiggle, and shake the dish to get the sugar to spread out. Tap out any excess sugar. Ignite a culinary torch and hold it near the ramekin so the flame is parallel to the surface of the custard. You want the heat from the flame to be very close to the sugar so it caramelizes, but not directly in contact with it or it will burn. Move the torch around the surface of the custard in a slow, even motion so as not to burn the sugar. Caramelize the surface of all four cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es.

Put 1/2 inch water in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan and place a metal rack across top of pan (rack should not touch water).Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade, and arrange pork strips 1 inch apart on rack. Roast in oven 15 minutes.Meanwhile, bring marinade to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, then boil 1 minute (marinade may look curdled). Remove from heat.Brush both sides of pork with some marinade and roast 10 minutes more. Generously brush both sides of pork with marinade again and roast, basting 2 or 3 times, 10 minutes more. I recommend brushing it as many times as it takes to use the marinade up; you wont regret it.Increase oven temperature to 400F and roast pork until strips are mahogany-colored and caramelized on edges, 10 to 15 minutes more (pork shoulder will need the most time, tenderloin the least; totally cooking time will be about 50 minutes). Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 10 minutes.Make dressing while pork roasts: Blend together all dressing ingredients in a blender until smooth. (See Note below about an alternate dressing.)Cook noodles and beans while pork finishes roasting: Soak noodles in cold water to cover until pliable, about 15 minutes, then drain in a colander. Cut noodles in half with kitchen shears.Cook beans in a 5- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a skimmer or slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, reserving cooking liquid in pot. Drain beans and pat dry.Return bean-cooking liquid to a boil, then cook noodles, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain noodles in colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Drain noodles again, then spread out on paper towels and pat dry.Assemble salad: Cut as much pork as desired for salad across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Toss noodles with 1/4 cup dressing in a bowl. Toss long beans with 2 tablespoons dressing in another bowl. Arrange pork, noodles, beans, and remaining salad ingredients on a large platter. Drizzle with some of dressing and serve remaining dressing on the side.Many notes (Updated 1/10/14):Pork tenderloin: As I mentioned in 2007, we made this with pork tenderloin rather than the pork shoulder called for and still do. As the cooking time is relatively short, and pork shoulder is so fatty, weve been concerned that the fat just wont render off in the amount of time that its in the oven. Pork tenderloin is gorgeous here; it already comes in about 2- to 3.5-inch wide strips, but I even enjoy halving it lengthwise into two strips that can be cut into small medallions, perfect for a salad. In the years since I shared this recipe (2011 to be exact), the USDA has (to the delight of cooks and restauranteurs, whove always preferred it this way) reduced the recommended internal cooking temperature of pork from 160F to 145F and this markedly improved the texture and flavor of the tenderloin.Meat vs. vegetable volume: While Im all for a vegetable-centric meal, and truly prefer meat as a side dish rather than a centerpiece, each time I make this, I think that the recipe would either benefit from double the pork or half the vegetables. Maybe its just that the pork is that good, so it goes quickly. Even if not doubling the pork, the amount of cucumber and green beans seems especially high for a salad of this size. Tweak the amounts to your anticipated tastes (meat-heavier, less green beans, or the like, etc.).The dressing: Its fine, you know? But in the years since I shared this recipe, Ive shared another noodle-meat-vegetable dish that has a sauce that Id prefer as a dressing here. The Dipping Sauce from these Cold Noodles with Peanut Lime Chicken (with fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, garlic and chiles) is boldly flavored and perfectly balanced. If those ingredients appeal to you, try it here as the dressing instead.Salt: Taste the hoisin-soy-sake sauce before adding the additional salt; you may find that you dont need it. (I found this even when using low-sodium soy sauce, and Id predicate this by saying that we probably already like salt more than we should.)Summer rolls: I remain convinced that leftovers from this salad would make for excellent summer rolls, wrapped in 8-inch rice paper rounds.Do ahead: Unsliced pork keeps, wrapped in foil and chilled, up to 3 days, or frozen, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in a sealed plastic bag, up to 1 month.See more: Date Night, Meat, Photo, Salad, VietnameseDo more: Link | Bookmark| Pin | Print| Email| 66 Comments", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/smitten-kitchen-34565", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Baking Pan", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/marshmallow-peeps-672213.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 672213, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Marshmallow Peeps", "preparationMinutes": 90, "creditText": "The Baking Pan", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "About 1 cup Colored Sugar for sprinkling in pan and coating cut-out Peeps.", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "colored sugar", "metaInformation": ["for sprinkling in pan and coating cut-out peeps."], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "About 1 teaspoon melted chocolate (dark, semisweet, or milk chocolate)", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "dark chocolate", "metaInformation": ["dark", "melted", "(, semisweet, or milk chocolate)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19904, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 envelopes unflavored gelatin", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "gelatin", "metaInformation": ["unflavored"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/gelatin.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 19177, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cups granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u2154 cup light corn syrup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light corn syrup", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 19350, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup cold water, divided", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": ["cold", "divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 1.0, "sourceUrl": "http://thebakingpan.com/recipes/candy/marshmallow-peeps/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 37, "aggregateLikes": 32, "instructions": "In a large bowl of an electric mixer, put  cup cold water. Sprinkle gelatin over the water; set aside about 10 minutes for gelatin to soften.In a medium-size heavy-bottomed pan, combine  cup water, sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals.Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 240 degrees F, a soft ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches 235 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 240 degrees. In addition, remove the pan from the heat just before the syrup reaches 240 degrees to prevent it from going over 240 degrees.With the electric mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot syrup into the gelatin mixture. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it. Gradually increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is thick and shiny and nearly tripled in volume, about 10 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium, slowly add the vanilla. Increase the speed to high and continue beating about 1 minute or until the vanilla is well combined.Scrape marshmallow mixture into the prepared 13x9 inch pan, or divide between several pie or cake pans if making different colors. Spread with a rubber spatula to make as smooth as possible. The mixture will be sticky.Coating: Generously sprinkle the top of the marshmallow with 1 to 3 tablespoons of the Colored Sugar. Tip: if using several pie or cake pans with different colors, the marshmallow doesnt need to cover the whole bottom of each pan. Just put however much you want for each color, spreading so the marshmallow is at least  inch thick.Let marshmallow sit uncovered, at room temperature, until set and dry, about 12 hours.Sprinkle a large pastry board with some of the colored sugar. Run a sharp kitchen knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the marshmallow. Invert the pan onto the pastry board. Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the top of the marshmallow with more of the colored sugar.Use a chick or bunny shaped cookie cutter that has been dipped in a little of the colored sugar to cut-out the Peep shapes. Dip the cut sides of the Peeps into the colored sugar to help prevent them from sticking together, shake off any excess sugar. Tip: Cut the left over scraps into small pieces, roll in the colored sugar to coat, and enjoy as snacks or in a cup of hot chocolate. I used a bottle cap to cutout these small egg shapes.Dip a toothpick in the melted chocolate and apply a dot of chocolate to form eyes and noses on the chicks and bunnies.Store Marshmallow Peeps

Special equipment: a baking stone or baking sheetPosition an oven rack in the bottom position of the oven, put a baking stone or a baking sheet on it and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line another baking sheet with parchment.Toss and squeeze together the mozzarella, salami, pepperoni, Parmesan, 4 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs, 1 of the eggs, banana peppers, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt and red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; set aside.Dust a work surface with flour, and unfold the puff pastry sheet onto it. Roll it out into a 9-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the pastry to the prepared baking sheet.Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs lengthwise down the center of the pastry. Pile and pack the cheese mixture into a log on top of the breadcrumbs, leaving a 1-inch border on the 2 short ends and about a 3-inch border on the 2 long sides. Fold the 1-inch borders to overlap the filling. Use kitchen shears to snip inch-wide strips of dough along both long sides that stop 1/2 inch from the filling, like a kind of fringe.Brush the pastry all over with some of the remaining beaten egg. Starting at 1 short end, alternate folding the strips, on a slight diagonal, over the filling to make a design that looks vaguely like a braid. The filling should be mostly covered, but some will peek out from the spaces between the strips. Holding both ends of the roll, bend it into a U shape. Brush the top and sides with more egg. Sprinkle oregano, red pepper flakes and Parmesan all over the top.Put the baking sheet with the pizza roll on top of the preheated baking sheet, and bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the pizza sauce. Use a serrated knife to slice the roll into pieces. Serve the pizza sauce on the side for dunking.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time  the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, but keep going, adding milk gradually to avoid lumps.

In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine 1 heaping cup peanut butter, corn syrup, sugars, and heat on high power for 1 minute to melt. Stop to stir. Mixture will be on the granular side, this is okay. Return bowl to microwave and heat for 1 more minute on high power. Stir in the vanilla. Stir in the cereal. Turn mixture out into prepared pan, packing it down somewhat firmly with a spatula and smoothing the top; set pan aside. For the Chocolate Topping - In a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips, shortening, and heat on high power for 1 minute to melt. I highly recommend using shortening for many reasons. It helps the chocolate melt smoother and easier. It prevents the chocolate from setting up too quickly. It keeps the chocolate from cracking when you slice into the finished bars because the chocolate is fudgier and more forgiving than typical hardened chocolate. Stop to stir. Chips may not be completely melted. Return bowl to microwave and heat in 10 to 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth. Pour chocolate over bars, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula or knife; set pan aside. Add 1/4 cup peanut butter to a small microwave-safe bowl and heat to melt, about 30 seconds. Stir peanut butter smooth. To create the marbled pattern, drizzle peanut butter over the chocolate in 5 wide, evenly spaced, parallel lines, each spanning the width of the pan. Like 5 rows of long train tracks. Rotate pan 90-degrees. With a toothpick, starting at the top of the pan, \"draw\" 5 evenly spaced lines through the peanut butter. In essence you're dragging the toothpick perpendicularly through the first set of lines to create the marbling. Cover pan with a sheet of foil (to prevent fridge smells), and place pan in fridge to set up for at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight, or until chocolate layer is completely set before lifting out with foil overhang, slicing, and serving. Bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

Boil for 5 minutes while still stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in rum.Poke holes in cake and drizzle half of the glaze over the cake. Invert onto a serving plate and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top and sides of the cake. Serve.

Also, mince the garlic cloves.Using kitchen shears, cut kimchi into bite size pieces.In a large wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat and add scallion (white part) and the minced garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant.Add kimchi and kimchi juice and cook for 1 minute to combine with the scallion.Add gochujang and soy sauce and cook stirring for 1 minute until kimchi starts to get soft. If kimchi starts to stick to the bottom but not cooked through yet, add a little bit of water or more kimchi juice. You can also add more kimchi juice if you like it spicy. Make sure you cook kimchi thoroughly before adding rice.Reduce heat to low and add the rice, stirring thoroughly to combine. Cook until the rice is warmed through, about 1-2 minutes. Toss the wok to keep the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan.Lastly, sprinkle sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green part of scallion (save some to garnish on top later). Add a pinch of freshly ground black pepper. Toss the wok from time to time If the ingredients look like they are about to burn and stick to the bottom of the pan.Meanwhile in a non-stick frying pan, heat oil over medium high heat and add the eggs. Turn down the heat to low and cook until egg white is completely cooked. The tip I learned to make a perfect sunny side up is to scoop the hot oil from the pan with a spoon and pour it over the uncooked egg white so that egg white will cook faster without overcooking the egg yolk.Serve Kimchi Fried Rice on a plate topped with a fried egg and sprinkled with scallions and shredded Korean seaweed.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/kimchi-fried-rice-605300", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Desserts with Benefits", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthy-Buttery-Lemon-Shortbread-Cookie-Dough-(sugar-free-and-gluten-free)-523283.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 523283, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Healthy Buttery Lemon Shortbread Cookie Dough (sugar free and gluten free!)", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Desserts with Benefits", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "64g (1/4 cup) Raw Almond Butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "almond butter", "metaInformation": ["raw"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12195, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "almond milk", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 93607, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "40g (1/4 cup) Brown Rice Flour", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "brown rice flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 20090, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp Butter Extract", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1001, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 15oz can Garbanzo Beans (drained and rinsed well;

To Make the Herb Oil: Heat 2 cups of olive oil to about 100 degrees F. Add 1 cup of chopped fresh herbs or 1/3 cup dried herbs. We used a mixture of fresh basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and parsley. Add the salt, pepper, and garlic. Stir together and allow to steep while you prepare the dough.2. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add the olive oil and water and mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until all the ingredients form a sticky ball. Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is soft and sticky. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl.3. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter to make a bed about 6 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and dust liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Let the dough relax for 5 minutes.4. Coat your hands with flour and stretch the dough from each end to twice its size. Fold it, letter style, over itself to return it to a rectangular shape. Mist the top  of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap.5. Let rest for 30 minutes. Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. After 30 minutes, repeat this one more time.6. Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1 hour. It should rise but not double in size.7. Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment paper and drizzle olive oil over the paper. Spread the oil with your hands or a brush to cover the entire surface. Lightly oil your hands and, using a plastic or metal pastry scraper, lift the dough off the counter and transfer it to the sheet pan, maintaining the rectangular shape as much as possible.8. Spoon half of the herb oil over the dough. Use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it to fill the pan simultaneously. Only use your fingertips to avoid tearing or ripping the dough. Try to keep the thickness as uniform as possible across the surface. Dimpling allows you to degas only part of the dough while preserving gas in the non-dimpled sections. If the dough becomes too springy, let it rest for about 15 minutes and then continue dimpling. Don\u2019t worry if you are unable to fill the pan 100 perfect, especially the corners. As the dough relaxes and proofs, it will spread out and fill the pan. Use more herb oil as needed to ensure that the entire surface is coated with oil.9. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough overnight (or for up to 3 days).10.Remove the pan from the refrigerator 3 hours before baking. Drizzle additional herb oil over the surface and dimple it in. This should allow you to fill the pan completely with the dough to a thickness of about 1/2-inch. Cover the pan with plastic and proof the dough at room temperature for 3 hours, or until the dough doubles in size, rising to a thickness of nearly 1 inch.11. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Place the pan in the oven. Lower the oven setting to 450 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking the focaccia bread for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is lightly golden brown. The internal temperature of the dough should register above 200 degrees F (measured in the center of the loaf).12. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately transfer the focaccia out of the pan onto a cooling rack. Allow the focaccia to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting and serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/focaccia-bread-548438", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 80, "servings": 26, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Smoked-mackerel-with-herb---beet-couscous-212094.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 212094, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Smoked mackerel with herb & beet couscous", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "150g pot 2% fat Greek yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "0% fat greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["2%"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 150.0, "id": 1256, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "250g pack cooked beetroot, cut into cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "beetroot", "metaInformation": ["cooked", "cut into cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beets.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 11080, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "100g couscous", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "couscous", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/couscous-cooked.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 20028, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cucumber, deseeded and cut into cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cucumber", "metaInformation": ["deseeded", "cut into cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11206, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "20g pack dill, roughly chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "dill", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dill.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 20.0, "id": 2045, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp horseradish sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "horseradish sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/horseradish-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2055, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "juice 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "250g pack peppered smoked mackerel fillets", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "mackerel fillets", "metaInformation": ["smoked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mackerel-fish-fillets.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 10015050, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "20g pack mint, roughly chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mint", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mint.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 20.0, "id": 2064, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "small red onion, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["red", "small", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/764641/smoked-mackerel-with-herb-and-beet-couscous", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 12, "aggregateLikes": 46, "instructions": "Put the couscous into a large bowl,pour over 150ml boiling water, then coverwith cling film.

add the cream cheese, dill, cucumber and 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice and pulse until smooth. Taste and add more lemon juice if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.For the eggplant: Place the eggplant spears on a baking sheet and lightly brush with the oil just to coat. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, Greek seasoning, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the eggplant in batches and coat with the flour mixture, shaking to remove the excess, then remove to a plate.For the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, Greek seasoning, lemon zest and a nice pinch of salt until combined. Slowly whisk in the beer until you achieve a pancake batter consistency; you may not use all of the beer. Allow the batter to rest 5 minutes. If it thickens, loosen with a bit more beer.Heat a fryer filled with oil to the proper level or a pot with about 2 inches of oil to 365 degrees F.In batches, dunk the flour-coated eggplant spears into the batter, shake off the excess and gently place in the oil. Fry until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes, making sure to maintain an oil temperature around 350 degrees F. Remove the eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately spritz lightly with lemon juice and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Serve immediately with the chilled dip.                                                            Cook's Note: You can find Greek seasoning-often a mix of onion, garlic, oregano and other Mediterranean herbs--at the grocery store in the spice aisle. Or use a favorite recipe and make it on your own.

a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, add the butter, chorizo, onion and garlic. Cook, stirring to keep the onions from browning, until the chorizo is cooked through and broken down to resemble ground meat, about 10 minutes.For the cornmeal: Into the skillet with the chorizo, add the milk, buttermilk and cornmeal. Bring to a simmer while whisking, to keep the cornmeal from clumping or sticking in the corners. When the liquid begins to thicken, turn off the heat and continue to stir until the mixture is the texture of loose grits.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs while very slowly adding a bit of the cornmeal mixture. Whisk vigorously to combine and then feel the outside of the bowl. If it's not warm, add a bit more of the cornmeal mixture while continuously whisking; keep adding the cornmeal mixture until the eggs are just as warm as the cornmeal mixture. Then, reversing the order, slowly pour the egg mixture into the cornmeal mixture, whisking vigorously. Add the Cheddar, mozzarella, corn, chopped tomatoes and chiles and scallions to the skillet and stir to combine.Bake until the edges are golden brown and the center is set, 35 to 40 minutes.

You'll work with 1 ball at a time, keeping the rest covered.3. Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into an oval, about 4\"x3\". Fold the oval in half to create bun shaped. Place on parchment square. Keep covered loosely with plastic wrap or towel to prevent drying out. Repeat with remaining dough.4. Prepare steamer (see photos above). Steam the buns for 15 minutes. You'll have to steam in 2 or 3 batches (avoid overcrowding the buns).FOR THE CHILI SAUCEPlace the green onion, chili, vinegar and salt in a small heatproof bowl.
