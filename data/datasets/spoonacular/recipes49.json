Tear bread into pieces and process in a food processor until coarse crumbs form. To make fine breadcrumbs, process until very fine. To make dry breadcrumbs, spread coarse or fine breadcrumbs on a baking sheet and bake at 250F until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. One slice of bread makes about 1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs or about 1/3 cup dry breadcrumbs. For store-bought coarse dry breadcrumbs we like Ians brand, labeled Panko breadcrumbs.

Then store in an airtight container for up to 3 months.

Place the remaining cup of cream into the now chilling bowl and set a mesh strainer on top. 4 In a separate bowl whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to avoid the eggs scrambling. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. 5 Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden spoon or heat proof spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir. When the custard becomes thick until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run.6 Pour the custard through the strainer into the cream.

Set aside. (Allowing the shallot to sit for a short time in vinegar pickles it slightly while also mellowing the flavor, removing the oniony bite.)Cut the celery into very thin slices, using a mandoline if you have one. Set the apple on a cutting board and cut as close to the core as possible, slicing a large segment off the side. Rotate and cut off another side, as close to the core as possible. Continue cutting in this fashion until you have 4 big pieces and a square-shaped core.Dispose of the core and place the flat side of each apple piece against the cutting board. Cut into thin slices. Then turn that stack of sliced apple on its side and cut into matchsticks.Add the olive oil, mustard and honey to the bowl with the shallots and stir to combine. When everything is well incorporated, add the celery, apple and dill. Fold all of the ingredients together, coating evenly with the vinaigrette.

You will need 1/4 cup for this recipe; store the remainder in an airtight jar. Stored at room temperature, it will keep for 6 months.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To make the chips: Cut off both ends of each plantain. With the tip of a sharp knife, slice the peel along the length of each plantain, avoiding cutting into the flesh. Repeat this in three different places on each plantain. Gently remove each section of peel. (Compost the peels and tips.) If the peels are difficult to remove, soak the plantains in hot water for a few minutes. Just be sure to dry them well with a clean kitchen towel before frying, to prevent splattering. With a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice each plantain as thinly as possible into rounds, ideally about 1/16 inch thick, keeping the slices of each plantain separate.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Put 1 tablespoon of the spice blend in a small paper bag. Line a plate with paper towels.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Warm about 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, about 375\u00b0F. Fry the slices of 1 plantain at a time, moving them around with a fork to ensure even cooking, until golden, about 1 minute. With a skimmer or slotted spoon, immediately transfer the slices to the paper bag with the spice mixture. Fold the top to seal, then shake vigorously to evenly coat. Transfer to the lined plate. Repeat this process with the remaining plantains and spice blend. Serve while they are hot and crispy.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creole-spiced-plantain-chips-from-afro-vegan-471737", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes":

You can use your paddle attachment, a spoon, or even clean hands to mix these two together. Add the yeast, olive oil, honey, salt, and fresh rosemary into the bowl and knead with the dough hook on medium speed for about 8 to 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and elastic. The dough will clean the sides of the bowl. If you do not have a stand mixer, you can knead by hand on a clean work surface. Oil a half sheet pan and place the dough on it to rise. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours, punching down and turning the dough after 1 hour. Flip the dough over on the oiled pan so that both sides are covered and gently press the dough out into the corners of the half sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let it proof in a warm place until puffy, about 30 minutes. Dimple the dough with your fingertips then cover with plastic wrap again and let it finish proofing until double in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425F and place a metal dish in the bottom of the oven to heat up. Sprinkle your toppings evenly over the dough and dot with pieces of butter.

Spray\u00a0one 9x5-inch loaf pan with floured cooking spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside. In a large bowl, add 2 cups + 2 tablespoons flour, sugars, baking soda, optional salt, and whisk to combine; set aside. In a medium microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, melt the butter, about 45 seconds on high power. Allow butter to cool momentarily so you don't scramble the egg. To the butter, add the egg, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and whisk to combine. Pour wet over dry and stir until just combined; don't overmix. Batter will be somewhat lumpy and don't try to stir the lumps smooth or bread will be tough; set aside. In a medium bowl, add the raspberries, 2 tablespoons flour, and toss lightly to combine (coating berries in flour helps to reduce sinking while baking). Add the raspberries to the batter and fold very lightly to combine. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula and pushing it into corners and sides as necessary. Baking time will range greatly based on if using fresh or frozen berries. I used frozen berries and baked for 1 hour 17 minutes, and tented the pan with foil (lay a sheet of foil over top of pan) at the 30-minute mark. If using fresh berries (highly recommended), I estimate baking time to be about 45 minutes; tent pan with foil about 30 minutes into baking to prevent top and sides from becoming overly browned. Bread is done when top is set in the middle, slightly domed, springy to the touch, and a toothpick inserted in the center (if you can find a patch without hitting raspberries) comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Allow bread to cool in pan for about 15 minutes before turning out on a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving. Optionally, serve bread with\u00a0Blueberry Butter,\u00a0Strawberry Butter,\u00a0Honey Butter,\u00a0Cinnamon-Sugar Butter, or\u00a0Vanilla Browned Butter Glaze.

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the flour, salt and sugar to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the flour resembles coarse cornmeal,  about 10 pulses.2. Drizzle 5 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture in the processor and pulse several times to work the water into the flour. Add the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue pulsing until the mixture develops small curds. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, shape it into a disc, and wrap it well. Refrigerate until chilled through, at least 1 hour.3. On a lightly floured surface, roll half the dough to 1/16-inch thickness. Cut out six 4 1/2-inch circles. (If you don\u2019t have a cookie cutter this large, a wide-mouth jar works well.) Ease the dough circles into a nonstick muffin tin with 12 standard-size (4 ounce) cups. Gently press out any overlapping folds in the pastry. Repeat with the remaining dough. Place the muffin tin in the freezer for 5 minutes. Remove and trim any overhang using the back of a knife so the pastry cups are flush with the top of the tin. Nestle a paper cupcake liner in each dough cup and fill it with dried beans or pastry weights. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the tin to a wire rack and let cool completely.Make the custard4. Keep the oven at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). 5. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup of the cream. Add the remaining cream and sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is smooth. Just to be sure, dip a spoon in the mixture and peer closely to check for sugar granules; none should remain. In a small bowl, blend the yolks with a fork until smooth. Slowly add the yolks to the cream mixture, stirring gently to combine.6. Remove the paper liners and pastry weights from the partially baked pastry cups.
