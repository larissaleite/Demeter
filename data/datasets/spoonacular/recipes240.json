Cook, stirring for 10 min. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar, and stew the chicken, turning it occasionally, until it\u2019s cooked through another 15-20 min. If you like, discard the thyme sprigs, rosemary, and garlic.When the stew is almost done, heat 1 Tbs. of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. When hot, add the zucchini. Season well with salt and pepper; saut\u00e9 until the zucchini is tender and lightly browned, 3 to 4 min. Transfer to a bowl. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet and add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until soft and lightly browned, 3 to 4 min. Add the olives and chopped thyme, return the zucchini to the pan, and toss. Fold the zucchini mixture and the parsley into the stew. Taste for salt and pepper.

Return to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven to cook until meat is fork-tender and sauce is rich and full of depth, 2 1/2 to 3 hours total, flipping meat once during cooking.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            While the meat is cooking, bring potatoes and garlic to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook until tender when pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, return to pot and add butter, milk and sour cream. Season with salt and pepper, and mash with a potato masher or a fork.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            When short ribs are done cooking, discard bay leaves and orange zest.

If the mixture is too thin, add extra ice until it is the consistency of a thick slushy. Pour into a container, and store in the freezer while you rinse the blender to make the next batch.If you would like to rim your glasses with salt or sugar, make a small slit in a fresh lime wedge and run it around the tops of your glasses to wet the edges. Then invert the glasses, and dip them in a bowl of salt or sugar to coat the rims.Use a spoon to scoop your desired first flavor of margaritas into the bottom of your serving glasses until they are 1/3 full. Add your second flavor, and then your final flavor. Serve immediately.*For those of you who would like to have somewhat straight lines between layers, I have a little tip. Once your first layer is in, do not add a huge spoonful of the next color on top. Rather, add just a few small spoonfuls of the next color in small piles around the edges of the first layer until you have made a circle border. Then fill in the center, and THEN you can start adding in larger spoonfuls on top of that. (Repeat with the third layer.) If you add a huge glop of a new color, it will make the layer underneath get super uneven and start to bleed color everywhere.But hey, after about 5-10 minutes, the colors will start to seep and combine anyway.

Spread the spears in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and roll to coat thoroughly. Roast the asparagus until lightly browned and tender, about 10 minutes, giving the pan a good shake about halfway through.Meanwhile, put the egg yolk, lemon juice, and cayenne in a blender.

Grind a generous amount of pepper over the top.Cook's Note: This recipe can be easily doubled. If you double the recipe, be sure to place the stems on the baking sheet so that the tips are pointed toward the center, and the bottoms are pointed out, toward the edges of the pan. Since the tips are thinner than the stems, they tend to cook faster. However, when roasting, items at the edges of the pan cooked more quickly than those in the center. Taking the time to lace them this way helps the asparagus cook evenly.Copyright 2005 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.
