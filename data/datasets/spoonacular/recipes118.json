To remove the wishbone at the top of the breast, use a small knife to scrape along the bone to expose it, then insert the knife and run it along the bone, separating it from the flesh.  Use your fingers to loosen it further, grasp the tip of the wishbone, and pull it out.  Tuck the wing tips back and under the neck.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Tying the chicken plumps the breast up and brings the legs into position for even roasting.  Cut a length of cotton string.  With the chicken on its back, slip the string under the tail and bring the ends up over the legs to form a figure eight.  Loop over the end of each leg and draw the strings tight to bring the legs together.  Draw the string back under the legs and wings on either side of the neck.  Pull tight, wrap one end around the neck, and tie off the two ends.  Salt the chicken evenly all around.  Coarse salt has a good texture of large grains that makes it easy to calibrate how much salt you are putting on the chicken; sprinkle it from up high, so that it falls like snow.  Season liberally with fresh-ground pepper.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F, put all the vegetables and herbs together in the bottom of a large, heavy ovenproof pot, and season with salt and pepper.  Set the chicken on top, dot with the butter, and roast uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes (or longer), depending on the size of the chicken.  It is done when the leg joint is pierced with a knife and the juices run clear, not pink.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before carving, and serve family-style with all of the caramelized vegetables and juices from the pot on a platter and the chicken pieces on top.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cook-the-book-thomas-kellers-one-pot-roast-chicken-199545", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/campari-citrus-ice-pops-736390.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 736390, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Campari-Citrus Ice Pops", "preparationMinutes": 490, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup Campari", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "campari", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93788, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Juice of 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 cups fresh orange juice", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "orange juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9206, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 16.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/katie-lee/campari-citrus-ice-pops.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 69, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Make the simple syrup: Combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

                                                          Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly spray 13- by 9-inch cake pan with baking spray. Line pan with parchment paper or heavy-duty foil lengthwise with one sheet, then crosswise with a second sheet to create a sling; spray once again with baking spray.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            For the Topping: Rub lemon zest into brown sugar with fingertips until no zest strands remain. Add flour and combine in medium bowl. Using two dinner knives, cut in butter until mixture is resembles wet sand. Stir in nuts and thyme; set aside.                                                                                                                                3                                                                            For the Cake: Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Add butter and beat on medium speed until combined, about 1 minute (mixture will be crumbly).                                                                                                                                4                                                                            In small bowl, beat together eggs, buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add egg mixture in slow steady stream. Beat just until combined. Pause mixer, scrape sides and bottom of bowl, then beat mixture on medium-high speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Scrape batter into prepared baking pan. Place 12 spoonfuls of preserves on top of batter. Run a knife through cake batter to create a marble swirl.

Transfer cake to cooling rack and cool in pan 10 minutes. Pull cake out onto a cooling rack using the parchment sling and cool completely, about 1 hour. Sprinkle cake with additional thyme leaves, if desired.

For the beef: In a large pan with straight sides on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook, while stirring, until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the bacon fat in the pan and add the olive oil, beef, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Brown the beef while breaking it up into bits, about 10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a plate and reserve. Leave the fat in the pan for the sauce.For the sauce: Add the butter and flour to the already-hot pan from the beef. If the butter begins to brown, lower the heat while working it into the flour. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, then raise the heat and slowly whisk in the milk. Once it begins to thicken slightly, add the heavy cream and continue to cook until the sauce reduces a bit more and thickens as well. Add the mustard. The sauce will not be thick like gravy, but not as thin as water either. Taste and season with a pinch of salt.For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Using a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish, layer starting at the bottom with: a few spoonfuls of sauce to cover the bottom, half of the ravioli in 1 layer, the Swiss cheese, half of the beef, half of the tomatoes, half of the remaining sauce, the remaining ravioli in 1 layer, the American cheese, the remaining beef, the remaining tomatoes, the remaining sauce and the reserved bacon. Top with all of the shredded cheese blend. Bake until the edges are bubbly and the cheese begins to brown, 30 to 35 minutes.Toss the lettuce and onion in a large bowl with the pickle juice. Serve each portion of casserole with a mound of this garnish over the top.

Stir in the chocolate chips, nuts and toffee bits.3. In a large, chilled mixing bowl (chill bowl and beaters in freezer for 15 minutes- or in fridge for an hour), whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into dry ingredients; combine well. It will be sticky.4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead gently until a soft dough forms; about 2 minutes. Form dough into 2 balls. Pat each ball out into a circle. Place each on a cookie sheet, and cut pie-like into 8 wedges.

Gently flip the cheese over with the tongs, grilling the other side of the slices. Cook for one more minute, then remove the slices from the grill and set on a plate.Top each slice with a small spoonful of tapenade and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately, while hot.Method for Olive Tapenade: Add all ingredients to a small food processor and pulse until the tapenade is finely chopped. Pop open the lid of the processor and taste. Does it need more acid? Add another teaspoon of lemon juice. Does it need more heat? Layer in a few more turns of the pepper grinder. Does it need a bit more fresh \u201cgreen\u201d notes?

                                   Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Pour half of the extra virgin olive oil into a large glass or ceramic baking dish. Place tomatoes in dish cut side up.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Pour remaining oil over tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 1 hour. Using tongs, turn tomatoes over. Bake 1 hour longer. Turn tomatoes over again. Bake until deep red and very tender, 15-45 minutes longer, depending on ripeness of tomatoes.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Transfer tomatoes and 1/4 cup of the oil to a large bowl, reserving the remaining oil for another use. Sprinkle garlic and parsley over tomatoes and let steep until tomatoes are room temperature. (Can be done and refrigerated up to five days ahead. Bring up to room temperature before using.)                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While the tomatoes are resting at room temperature, place yellow and green squash slices in a large mixing bowl.

Working in batches, arrange squash slices in pan in a single layer and cook for two minutes on each side or until well-browned. Remove and transfer to the bowl containing the tomatoes, coating the slices in oil. Repeat with remaining squash.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook pasta until al dente. Drain and immediately toss with tomato, squash and olive oil mixture. If it seems a little dry, add some of the reserved oil until pasta is uniformly glossy.

Line an 8-inch-squarebaking dish with foil.Process the chocolate wafers in a food processor with the butter, sugar, coffee and salt until fine. Evenly press the crust into the prepared dish, covering the bottom completely. Bake until the crust sets, about 15 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, heat the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl at 75% power until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth).Blend the cream cheese, sugar and sour cream together in the food processor until smooth. Scrape down the sides as needed. Add the eggs and pulse until just incorporated. With the food processor running, pour the chocolate into the wet ingredients and mix until smooth.Pour the filling evenly over the crust. Bake until the filling puffs slightly around the edges but is still a bit wobbly in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack.For the glaze: Put the chocolate, butter and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl and heat at 75% power until melted, about 2 minutes. Stir the ingredients together until smooth; add the sour cream. Spread the glaze evenly over the warm cake and scatter the crushed candy canes over top. Cool completely, and then refrigerate overnight. Cut into small bars or squares. Serve chilled or at room temperature.Store the bars covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.                                                            To crush the candy canes, remove the wrappers and place in a resealable plastic bag. Use a rolling pin to roll over and break up the candy into small pieces, about 1/4 inch or so.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Spray the insides of 24 4-ounce jars with cooking spray.2. Make the strawberry cake batter: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Add in the butter and strawberry puree.  Starting slowly, mix together.  Mix for 2 to 3 minutes, or until you have a thick batter.  In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they are frothy then add the milk.  Add one third of the egg/milk mixture to the batter then mix to combine.  Repeat twice until all of the egg/milk mixture is incorporated.  Set aside.3. Make the white and chocolate cake batters: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  In another large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl in between additions.  In a small bowl, combine the milk and the cream.  Add one-third of the milk mixture into the butter mixture, then one-third of the flour mixture.  Continue until all of the ingredients have been incorporated.  Stir in the vanilla.  Divide the batter evenly into 2 bowls.  In a small bowl, mix the hot coffee or water and the cocoa powder together.  Add the cocoa mixture to one of the bowls and mix until incorporated.4. Working with one flavor at a time, scoop 2 tablespoons of each of the batters into the prepared jars.  Place the jars 2 inches apart on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centers bounce back when touched.  Remove and let cool completely.5. Make the frosting: Cream the butter, then add in the confectioners' sugar.  Beat until light and fluffy.  Beat in 2 tablespoons of heavy cream.  Divide the frosting evenly into 3 bowls.  Add the strawberry puree to one, the bittersweet chocolate to the second and the vanilla extract to the third.  If needed, add more cream to get the right consistency.6. Transfer the frostings to 3 disposable icing bags.  Cut off the tips, the place the 3 bags into a large pastry bag fitted with a star tip.

Place coated chicken on a baking tray that is covered in wax paper. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken. Place the baking tray into the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This will help the breading stick to the chicken.Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken, cooking a few pieces at a time. Cook for 3-4 minutes; turn chicken over and cook 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.  Place onto a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any remaining grease.Whisk the vinaigrette thoroughly then drizzle it onto the greens, tomato halves, roasted bell pepper, kalamata olives, and feta cheese; toss to coat evenly.Serve a piece of chicken with a large spoonful of greens on each plate.
