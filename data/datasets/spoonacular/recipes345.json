Set aside.In a large saucepan set over medium heat, add the olive oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is starting to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and oregano, cook, stirring, for 1 additional minute.Add the diced tomatoes, squash pieces, mashed squash, chicken broth, and quinoa. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the quinoa turns translucent, about 15 minutes.Add the shredded chicken, kalamata olives (if using), and salt & pepper. Simmer, uncovered, until chicken is heated through and sauce has thickened to your liking. For me, this took about 10-15 more minutes. Add more salt/pepper if needed, to taste.Garnish with the fresh parsley + serve.

Spray a 24 cup mini muffin tin (or 12 cup regular muffin tin) with non stick cooking spray and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.In a small bowl, combine the eggs, applesauce, yogurt, zucchini and carrot (if you dont want any visible veggies this can be pureed in a blender or food processor instead).Add this to the flour mixture and stir until just combined.Divide the batter between the 24 prepared muffin cups, heaping it up in each cup. For regular sized muffins, the 12 cups were filled to the top.Bake for 16-18 minutes (or 22-24 minutes if making full size muffins) or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out

Professional Recipe: This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and makes a large quantity. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe in the proportions indicated and therefore cannot make any representation as to the results.                                                    Cook's Notes: The Onion Jam recipe will yield a little more than you need for the Bacon Onion Dip. Heat some of the leftovers in a frying pan and add to a grilled cheese sandwich, top a burger, serve with a grilled steak or toss in with scrambled eggs. You might want to make a double recipe because there are so many ways to use the Onion Jam!

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles, berries burst, & it becomes thick.  Add enough orange juice to thin it out, but still coat the back of a spoon.  Allow to cool completely.For the whipped cream cheese: Place cream cheese & sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment.  Whisk until sugar dissolves. Add Cool Whip & whisk on high until the whisk leaves ripples in the cream cheese mixture.  Keep cold until ready to assemble.To assemble: Break up the pie crust, except the stars, to make crumbs.  In small, clear, plastic cups, layer alternately with crumbs, cream cheese, & blueberry filling; starting & ending with crumbs.  Place stars on the very top layer for decoration.

Spread the hazelnuts on a half-sheet pan and bake until the skins are cracked, about 10 minutes. A handful at a time, place the warm hazelnuts in a kitchen towel and rub together in the towel to remove the skin (some skin may remain on the nuts). Cool completely.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the cooled nuts with 1/2 cup flour until finely ground. Mix the remaining 2 cups flour, the cinnamon, baking powder, and salt with the nut mixture in the a medium bowl.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Beat the butter and superfine sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light in color and texture, about 5 minutes, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula. Gradually beat in the egg. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture. The dough will be very moist. Place the dough on a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap loosely in the plastic and shape into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Refrigerate until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Position racks in the center and top third of the oven and preheat to 350\u00baF. Line three half-sheet pans with parchment paper.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Cut the chilled dough in half. Place one half of the dough on a lightly floured work surface, and sprinkle the top with flour. Roll out the dough into a 1/8 \u2013inch-thick rectangle. Using a 2 \u00bc inch-heart-shaped cookie cutter, dipped in flour, cut out the cookies. Transfer to the prepared pans. (The dough is delicate, and you will probably find it easiest to move the hearts with a floured offset metal spatula.) Gather up the scrapes and set aside. Repeat rolling and cutting out the cookies with the remaining half of dough. Place the pans in the refrigerator (there is no need to cover them). Combine all of the remaining scraps into \u00bd-inch-thick rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough until lightly chilled, about 10 minutes. Repeat the rolling cutting procedure until all of the dough has been cut into hearts and placed on the pans. Refrigerate the hearts on the pans until well chilled, about 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Bake the first two pans of cookies, switching the position of the baking pans from top to bottom and front to back, until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned, 15 to 17 minutes. Repeat with the last pan of cookies. Cool completely on the pans.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Arrange half of the cookies on a half-sheet pan lined with parchment paper, with the undersides facing up. Spoon about \u00bd teaspoon of the raspberry preserves onto the centers of the cookies. Top each with one of the remaining cookies, flat sides facing, to make a sandwich. Cover with parchment and let stand at least 8 hours or overnight to set. Note:The cookies can be stored in an airtight container, with the layers separated by parchment paper, for up to 5 days.

Cover and cook for 3 minutes. (Meanwhile, rinse the spatula or spoon for use again later.) Uncover the pan and wash down the sides once more.3. Attach the candy thermometer to the saucepan, without letting it touch the bottom of the pan, and cook the sugar mixture uncovered, without stirring, until it reaches 305\u00b0F (152\u00b0C).4. Meanwhile, heat the cream in a small saucepan until tiny bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Turn off the heat and cover the pan to keep the cream hot.5. When the sugar mixture is at 305\u00b0F (152\u00b0C), turn off the heat and stir in the butter chunks. Gradually stir in the hot cream; it will bubble up and steam dramatically. Turn the burner back on and adjust it so that the mixture boils energetically but not violently. Stir until smooth. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, to about 245\u00b0F (118\u00b0C).

Stir in the flour and mix until just barely combined.In a second mixing bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until combined. Stir in the pumpkin, egg and vanilla, and beat until smooth. Stir in the remaining ingredients, and set aside.Spread half of the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan. Drop alternating spoonfuls of the pumpkin filling and the remaining brownie batter onto the brownie layer. Run a sharp knife through the batter in a zig zag sort of motion to swirl the brownie batter and pumpkin filling together.Bake in preheated oven until the edges are set and the middle is still a little wobbly, about 25-30 minutes. Let cool in the pan about 15 minutes, then use the edges of the parchment to lift out the brownies and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Cut the cooled brownies into squares, and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days (assuming they last that long).</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-swirl-brownies-539496", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
