Spray two muffin pans with non-stick spray.Add a heaping tablespoon of the pretzel mixture to each individual muffin cup. Using your fingers, press the crust evenly into the bottom of each cup.Bake the crust for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before adding the cookie dough.In a small bowl, add flour, corn starch, kosher salt, and baking soda. Set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars and cooled butter. Whisk in vanilla extract, egg, and egg yolk.Fold the flour mixture into the sugar mixture until just incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips.Using a cookie scoop, drop slightly mounded scoops of dough directly on top of the pretzel crust. Using your fingers, press the cookie dough down slightly. Top with a few crushed pretzel pieces. Bake one muffin pan at a time, storing the other pan in the refrigerator, for 16-17 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.Transfer the muffin pan to a wire rack. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing. Allow the cups to cool completely on the wire racks before storing in an airtight container. Cookies will stay fresh in an airtight container for up to 7 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-chip-cookie-cups-with-a-pretzel-crust-491339", "dishTypes": [],
