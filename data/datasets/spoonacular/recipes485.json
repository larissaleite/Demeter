Beat in sugar and vanilla extract. Whisk together salt, baking powder, and flour. Stir into wet ingredients just until blended.  Spread in prepared pan. Batter will be in a very thin layer and you will need to use a wooden spoon or spatula to spread it to all the corners of the pan. Bake for 9-11 minutes (mine took 10). While the cake is baking, set a clean kitchen towel out on a large work surface. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar (about 1/4 cup). As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, turn it over on the kitchen towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Remove foil carefully. Working at the short end, fold the edge of the towel over the cake. Roll tightly, rolling up the cake into the towel. Let cool completely while rolled, at least one hour. While the cake is cooling, place heavy cream and chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup. Heat for about 45 seconds, then whisk until smooth. If the chocolate doesn\u2019t want to melt, you can heat in additional 15 second increments until it will. Chill until the mixture is spreadable, but not runny, about 30 minutes to one hour.

This can take 5 to 10 minutes of processing, so be patient.Process in the sugars, butter and vanilla. The sweeteners will at first thicken the nut butter quite a bit, but keep processing and the heat will eventually melt the sugar and smooth out the nut butter. Once again, if it still looks too thick, keep processing!Now here is the hard part \u2013 when your nut butter is finished processing, you need to pop it into the fridge to chill. If you don\u2019t chill it, the chocolate chips will melt right into the nut butter and turn everything brown (yes, this happened!). Once it\u2019s chilled, about 25 minutes, stir in the mini chocolate chips. This creates about about 1 1/2 cups of nut butter, more than you will need to fill all 24 of the chocolate cups. Remaining nut butter can be stored in fridge for 2-3 weeks, use on crackers ort toast.While the \"cookie dough\" is cooling off, line a mini muffin pan with with 24 liners. Melt 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips (I do mine in the microwave, heating on full power for 20 seconds, stir, 30 seconds again, and stir until melted).

This can take 5 to 10 minutes of processing, so be patient.Process in the sugars, butter and vanilla. The sweeteners will at first thicken the nut butter quite a bit, but keep processing and the heat will eventually melt the sugar and smooth out the nut butter. Once again, if it still looks too thick, keep processing!Now here is the hard part \u2013 when your nut butter is finished processing, you need to pop it into the fridge to chill. If you don\u2019t chill it, the chocolate chips will melt right into the nut butter and turn everything brown (yes, this happened!). Once it\u2019s chilled, about 25 minutes, stir in the mini chocolate chips. This creates about about 1 1/2 cups of nut butter, more than you will need to fill all 24 of the chocolate cups.

Position a rack in the bottom of the oven and crank up the heat to 425F (218C).2. Remove any pin feathers from the turkey and pat the bird dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with a wedge of orange and of lemon, season well with salt and pepper, and stuff with the remaining wedges and the bay leaves. Tuck the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together. Mix together the melted butter, paprika, 1 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and brush about half of it over the turkey. Place the bird breast side down on a V-rack set in a roasting pan.3. Slip the turkey into the oven, pour 2 cups of water into the pan, and roast for 30 minutes. Lower the heat to 350F (176C), flip the bird breast side up, and brush with some of the remaining butter-paprika mixture.4. Continue roasting and brushing the turkey every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165F (74C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Tent the bird with foil if browning too quickly.5. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter and let stand, tented, for 20 minutes. Although its not the custom in Portugal, you can make gravy (see Variao, below).Make Dinas potato dressing6. Meanwhile, plonk the potatoes into a large pot of cold water. Add 1 tablespoon salt, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, return half to the pot, and mash well. Set the rest aside and keep warm.7. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until the foaming subsides. Crumble in the ground sausage and cook, breaking up the clumps, until well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the sausage into the pot with the mashed potatoes. Lower the heat to medium and, if the skillet is dry, add a bit more butter. Drop in the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 12 minutes. Scrape in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the chopped reserved liver and saut until browned, about 3 minutes. Scoop the mixture into the pot with the mashed potatoes.8. Whisk the yolks and milk into the potatoes until smooth; if the dressing is too thick, whisk in more milk. Place the pot over medium heat and stir to cook the yolks, about 3 minutes. Fold in the reserved potatoes, sprinkle in the nutmeg and parsley, and season well with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.Make Av Costas bread dressing9. Heat a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring often, until the fat has rendered and the meaty bits are crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels. Pour off all but a thin film of fat from the pot into a cup and reserve. Bump up the heat to medium-high, add the chourico, and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat, adding it to the bacon fat. If the pan is dry, add 2 tablespoons of oil.10. Lower the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook until soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute more. Splash in the wine, add the red pepper paste and tomato paste, scrape up any stuck-on bits, then let burble for a few minutes to cook the mixture.11. Turn the heat to low, add the bread and the reserved bacon and chourico fats, and pour in just enough of the stock-water combination, beating well with a spoon, to make the mixture moist. If you use all the liquid and the pot is still dry, add water as necessary. Fold in the bacon and chourico and continue beating to lighten the mixture. Take a taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Scoop the dressing into a bowl and speckle with the parsley.12.
