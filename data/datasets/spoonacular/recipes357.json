Whisk 4 egg whites until frothy then add 1 cup of powdered sugar slowly to make a meringue.  Whip to a medium peak, not too stiff or it will be dry. Add 4 egg yolks and 1/2 tsp vanilla, folding gently to not deflate the batter. Sift in 1 cup flour while egg mixture is still streaky and continue to fold gently until just combined. Right away, pipe the batter using a small #3 tip into two 6 inch round disks and the remaining batter into 3.5 inch lady fingers. Dust generously with powdered sugar and bake for 3-5 minutes.  The lady fingers should be white (not golden brown) and also bounce back.Line a 6 inch cake pan or springform with plastic wrap leaving a generous overhang. Place one of the lady finger disks on the bottom, upside down.  Using about half of the Bavarian, pour it over the cake.  Place a second piece of the cake over the Bavarian. Top the cake with the gelee. Fill the rest of the pan with the remaining Bavarian. Freeze the cake (when it is frozen you can use the excess plastic to lift it out of the pan). Place the cake on a stand, set the lady fingers around the outside of the cake and hold in place by tying with a decorative ribbon. Decorate the top of the Strawberry Charlotte with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/strawberry-charlotte-509403", "dishTypes": ["side dish"],

Stir in the barley and thyme, and cook, stirring, until the barley is just golden, about 2 minutes more.Transfer the barley mixture to a 6-quart slow cooker, and add the broth, 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover, and cook on high until the liquid is absorbed and the barley is tender, about 3 hours.Discard the thyme, and stir in the asparagus. Return the lid to the pot, and cook until the asparagus is tender, 30 minutes more. Stir in the Parmesan, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Thin out the risotto to the desired consistency with warm water, as needed. Fold in the parsley and mint, and serve with lemon wedges on the side.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.
