Add the vanilla and salt and whip on medium or high speed for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the cream holds soft peaks.                                                                                    3                                              Mix the peanuts and pecans together in a bowl and set aside. If the peanut butter caramel has cooled too much to pour easily, warm it gently over low heat, then transfer it to a glass measuring cup.                                                                                    4                                              Spread a spoonful of the whipped cream over the bottom of a 9 \u00d7 13-inch baking pan, or a similarly sized platter. (This keeps the graham crackers from sliding around.) Lay down six or more graham crackers, enough to completely fill the bottom of the pan. Lightly cover the top of the graham crackers with a quarter of the remaining whipped cream.                                                                                    5                                              Peel and quarter the bananas lengthwise, then chop them fine. Arrange a third of the bananas over the whipped cream. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the mixed nuts, and drizzle about a quarter of the peanut butter caramel sauce over the top. Make another layer with graham crackers, whipped cream, bananas, nuts, and caramel, then repeat again. (You will have three layers of crackers, whipped cream, bananas, nuts, and caramel.)                                                                                    6                                              Top with a final layer of crackers. Swirl the remaining whipped cream on top, sprinkle with the remaining nuts, and drizzle on the remaining peanut butter caramel sauce.                                                                                    7                                              Refrigerate the cake uncovered for 4 hours, or until the crackers have softened completely. This cake is best when made no more than 12 hours ahead of time. It will last 3 days, covered, in the refrigerator.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/no-bake-banana-and-peanut-butter-caramel-icebox-cake-from-the-kitchn-cookbook-625592",

Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and olive oil stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup flour in to the dough, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. You can also do all the mixing and kneading in your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.While the dough rises make the whipped feta and roast the garlic and peppers. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Wrap the the garlic cloves in foil and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes or until the garlic is soft. At the same time, brush the red pepper and jalapenos with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then either grill or roast them  I stuck them in the oven with garlic and just watched until they were charred. Remove both from oven and let cool. Once they are cooled, remove skins, cut in half and discard the seeds (I left some seeds in) and slice.Add crumbled feta and roasted garlic cloves to a food processor and pulse until small crumbs remain. Add in the cream cheese and puree for 4-5 minutes, scraping down the sides when necessary, until feta is super creamy. Add in the olive oil, lemon juice, basil, dill and pepper. Puree until combined and smooth.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Cut the dough in half and either freeze the other half, save for another day or double the toppings listed above to make two pizzas (there is probably enough whipped feta for 2 pizzas). Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel.Preheat oven to 375 degrees or follow the [cast iron skillet method|http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/green-olive-pesto-pizza-with-roasted-red-peppers-and-feta-stuffed-crust/].Spread a nice thick layer of the whipped feta (I used about half to three-fourths) all over the pizza crust. Scatter the sliced roasted red pepper, sliced olives and 1/3 of the roasted jalapeos on top. Cover with the mozzarella cheese and then top that with the chopped tomatoes and the remaining roasted jalapeos. Sprinkle on the crumbled feta and pine nutes. Place in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until cheese and crust is golden and bubbly. Remove and immediately top with the fresh basil. Let cool five minutes, slice and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/whipped-feta-and-roasted-jalapeo-greek-pizza-549422", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish",
