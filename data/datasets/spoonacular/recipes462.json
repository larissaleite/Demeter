After removing the scones from the oven, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together all glaze ingredients until smooth. When the scones are mostly cooled (they can be slightly warm yet), drizzle the peanut butter glaze over the scones. I believe scones are always best the day they are baked. But this recipe does allow for some advance prep. The unbaked dough freezes really well, enabling you to store the unbaked scones in your freezer and bake them up fresh when desired. Just cut the dough into wedges, place them on a tray in the freezer for an hour and then transfer the frozen wedges to a plastic freezer bag.

Make a well in the center and add buttermilk, egg, and vanilla. Stir just until combined, taking care to not overmix.Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead 5 or 6 times. Pat into an 8'' circle and cut into 8 wedges. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, about 1-1/2'' apart. Brush each wedge of dough lightly with milk. Then bake until scones are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. After removing the scones from the oven, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together all glaze ingredients until smooth. When the scones are mostly cooled (they can be slightly warm yet), drizzle the peanut butter glaze over the scones.
