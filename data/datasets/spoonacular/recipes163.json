Spread the breadcrumbs in a shallow plate or pie dish. In a second shallow dish, combine the flour, garlic powder, and salt. In a third shallow dish whisk together the egg whites, water, mustard and thyme. Whisk to blend.</p><p>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Spray the rack lightly with cooking spray.  Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge each chicken piece in the flour to coat completely, shaking off the excess. Then dip into the egg white mixture and finally coat with the panko. Press gently into the panko to make sure they adhere. Place the chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet. Spray the tops of the chicken pieces lightly with cooking spray.</p><p>Bake until the chicken is no longer pink and reads 160 F internally on an instant-ready thermometer, about 8-10minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven. Place the buffalo sauce in a bowl and use tongs to lightly coat the chicken pieces in the buffalo sauce. Set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly and let the sauce soak in.</p><p>To make the dressing, combine all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor starting with  cup of the buttermilkand blend for 10 seconds. Check the consistency and taste and blend in additional buttermilk as desired. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p><p>Divide the salad greens among four serving plates. Top with halved cherry tomatoes. Add a few chicken tenders to each plate. Drizzle lightly with the dressing. Garnish with additional toppings, as desired.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/buffalo-chicken-salad-with-creamy-avocado-ranch-dressing-631113", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main
