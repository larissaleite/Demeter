Chop the bacon into very small pieces and set aside.Place chocolate and butter in a metal bowl and put the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until everything is melted.Remove the bowl from the water and stir in the sugar. Let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt; set aside.When the chocolate mixture is cool, beat with an electric mixer or your stand mixer for 3 minutes. The mixture will get just a tad thicker.Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds between each one. After two or three eggs, the mixture will start to get thicker and shinier.Once all the eggs are incorporated, add the dry ingredients. Mix on a low speed until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.Add the bacon and fold it in with a spatula.Scoop the batter into cupcake cups until 1/2 to 2/3 full.Bake at 350\u00b0 Fahrenheit for 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes in the pan before removing to a cooling rack.For the Caramel Swiss Meringue ButtercreamMake the caramelPlace half of the sugar and the water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is clear. Let the syrup come to a boil, washing down the sides with a wet pastry brush if necessary to prevent crystals from forming.Boil the syrup, swirling occasionally, until it changes color to dark amber (~340\u00b0 on a candy thermometer).Immediately remove from the heat (the sugar will burn if it gets to 350\u00b0). Carefully add the cream, standing away from the pan since the mixture will bubble a lot. Stir the caramel until smooth and transfer to a heatproof bowl to cool. (I actually put the bowl into an ice bath, stirring occasionally, to help it cool faster.)While the caramel cools, place the rest of the sugar, the egg whites and the salt in the metal bowl of a standing mixer. Place the bowl over a pan of boiling water. Whisk continuously until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture reaches 140\u00b0 Fahrenheit.Fit the standing mixer with the whisk attachment and put the bowl in place. Beat the mixture on medium-high speed until it is stiff.Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and begin adding the butter, a tablespoon or two at a time. Beat until the butter is no longer visible, and add in more, until it is all added. At some point it will look curdled and broken, but just keep on beating and beating until it gets smooth again. This could take a few minutes.Switch to the paddle attachment and add the caramel and vanilla extract. Beat on low until combined and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.At this point you can frost your cupcakes, or you can refrigerate the buttercream for up to 2 days.

Get it nice and hot, but not smoking; on about medium-high heat.Add the potato pancakes and fry without moving or turning them for about 4 - 5 minutes.Carefully flip them over with a spatula and cook for about another 4 minutes; remove and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/stuffed-gluten-free-potato-pancakes-with-a-variety-of-optinal-fillings-562269", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Damn Delicious", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/zucchini-shrimp-scampi-780759.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 780759, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Zucchini Shrimp Scampi", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 305.83, "creditText": "Damn Delicious", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup chicken stock", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken stock", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 6172, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh parsley leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11297, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "Juice of 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground", "to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan", "metaInformation": ["freshly grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "red pepper flakes", "metaInformation": ["red", "to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1032009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "shrimp", "metaInformation": ["medium", "deveined", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 15152, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 pounds (4 medium-sized) zucchini, spiralized", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "zucchini", "metaInformation": ["(4 medium-sized)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 11477, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 81.0, "sourceUrl": "http://damndelicious.net/2015/01/24/zucchini-shrimp-scampi/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add shrimp, garlic and red pepper flakes.

I have been blogging for about 5 years now and I have found that I one of my favorite things to blog about is recipes. I cook for my family of 6 at least 6 days a week, so I am always looking for great recipes for my family to enjoy. I also enjoy other things like hiking, crafting, decorating, DIY and watching some great shows on HGTV, so I like quick and easy recipes that are family favorites so I can get in and out of the kitchen quickly. One of my family's favorite recipe is my Homemade Lasagna. It is a great recipe that is super easy to fix. This recipe for Skinny Red Beans and Rice comes from my mom and we have loved it for years. I have discovered that one of the secrets of great southern cooks is that they add a little sugar to their recipes! This recipe has just a smidgeon and I know my husbands grandmother always added a tsp of sugar to her vegetables and they were the BEST!I love this recipe because you can cook it in the crockpot for some great flavor. Or if I am really in a rush and I forget to plan ahead I can make it in a pot on the stove right before dinner. Use smoked turkey sausage to make it healthier. I love that it has so many great flavors in it too. It is just spicy enough to havea little kick, but not too spicy. You could add some more heat if you would like by adding some diced Jalapeo peppers or use a mild variety of diced tomatoes and chilies for less heat. It is a very customizable recipe. It is also chocked full of beans and tomatoes for some great nutrition.Did you know that beans and rice together make a complete protein? Lots of good for you stuff in this great recipe! Sometimes I fix my wonderful Skillet Cornbreadand put the bean mixture of a piece of delicious cornbread instead of the rice.
