To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.                            Contestant/Competition Recipe: This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition. The Food Network Kitchen have not tested it for home use and therefore cannot make any representation as to the results.                            Propane Gas Torch Safety: Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \"finger tight\" when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

Top with a second rectangle and sprinkle it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the zest-sugar mixture. Repeat with the remaining dough rectangles and zest-sugar mixture, ending with a stack of 5 rectangles. Work carefully when adding the crumbly zest filling, or it will fall off when you have to lift the stacked pastry later.7. Slice the stack crosswise through the 5 layers to create 6 equal strips, each about 4 by 2 inches. Fit these layered strips into the prepared loaf pan, cut edges up and side by side. (While there is plenty of space on either side of the 6 strips widthwise in the pan, fitting the strips lengthwise is tight. But that\u2019s fine because the spaces between the dough and the sides of the pan fill in during baking.) Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place (70 \u00b0F [21\u00b0C]) until puffy and almost doubled in size, 30 to 50 minutes. Press the dough gently with a fingertip. If the indentation remains, the dough is ready for baking.8. Bake the coffee cake until the top is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes.Make the cream cheese icing9. In a medium bowl with a rubber spatula, vigorously mix the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Beat in the milk and lemon juice until the mixture is creamy and smooth.10. To remove the coffee cake from the pan, tilt and rotate the pan while gently tapping it on a counter to release the cake sides. Invert a wire rack on top of the coffee cake, invert the cake onto the rack, and carefully lift off the pan. Invert another rack on top, invert the cake so it is right side up, and remove the original rack.11. Slip a sheet of waxed paper under the rack to catch any drips from the icing. Using a pastry brush, coat the top of the warm cake with the icing to glaze it. (Cover and refrigerate the leftover icing for another use. It will keep for up to 2 days.)12. Serve the coffee cake warm or at room temperature. To serve, you can pull apart the layers, or you can cut the cake into 1-inch-thick slices on a slight diagonal with a long, serrated knife. If you decide to cut the cake, don\u2019t attempt to cut it until it is almost completely cool.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lemon-scented-pull-apart-coffee-cake-597145", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 225, "servings": 14, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Moms Dish", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/One-Pot-Beef---Broccoli-618391.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 618391, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "One Pot Beef & Broccoli", "preparationMinutes": 20, "pricePerServing": 171.75, "creditText": "Moms Dish", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 pounds Beef", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "beef", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 23572, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "4 cups Broccoli", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "broccoli", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broccoli.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11090, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons Brown Sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 teaspoons Corn Starch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "corn starch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "3 Garlic Cloves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Light Olive Oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "light olive oil", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Salt; to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons Sesame Oil", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sesame oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4058, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons Soy Sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "soy sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 16124, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups Hot Water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": ["hot"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 78.0, "sourceUrl": "http://momsdish.com/recipe/537/one-pot-beef-broccoli-recipe", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 19, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Prepare all ingredients ahead of time.
