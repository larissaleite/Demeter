Prepare canner, jars and lids. Wash the jars, lids and screw bands in hot, soapy water. Rinse well and drain (you don't need to dry them). Place a rack in the bottom of a boiling-water canner, then place the required number of jars on the rack. Add water to the jars and the canner until it reaches the top of the jars. Cover the canner and bring the water to a simmer (180 degrees F) over medium heat. Do not boil the jars. Keep jars hot until you're ready to use them. Place the lids in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a simmer (180 degrees F) over medium heat. Again, do not boil the lids. Keep lids hot until you're ready to use them. Set the screw bands aside, they do not require heating.2. Tie pickling spice in a square of cheesecloth, creating a spice bag3. In a large stainless steel saucepan, combine vinegar, water, sugar, pickling salt and spice bag. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Reduce the heat and boil gently for 15 minutes. 4. Working with one jar at a time, remove a jar from the canner, pouring hot water back into the canner. Place the jar on a heat-protected work surface, such as a wooden cutting board or towel. Place 1 bay leaf, 1 garlic clove, \u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds and 1\u00bd teaspoons dill seeds into each jar. Pack cucumber slices into hot jars to within a generous \u00bd-inch of the top of the jar. Ladle hot pickling liquid into the jar to cover the cucumbers, leaving \u00bd-inch headspace. Slide a nonmetallic utensil, such as a rubber spatula, down between the food and the inside of the jar two or three times to release air bubbles. Adjust headspace, if necessary, by adding more hot pickling liquid. With a clean damp cloth or paper towel, wipe jar rim and threads. Using a magnetic or nonmetallic utensil, lift a hot lid from the water and place it on the jar, centering the sealing compound on the rim of the jar. Place a screw band on the jar. With your fingers, screw band down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip-tight. (Do not use excessive force to tighten.) Return the jar to the rack in the hot water-filled canner.

In a large pot of heavily salted boiling water, cook the rigatoni according to the package directions for al dente. Drain and (once cooled) add to a large bowl along with the chicken, celery and green onions. Toss well.In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, blue cheese, lemon juice, mustard, hot sauce, beer, honey, black pepper, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir until smooth, then add to the bowl with the rigatoni. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.Refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with chopped celery leaves before serving.

When the oil is nice and hot, brown the italian sausage links for about 10 minutes (turning every couple of minutes). Remove from pot and slice sausage into rounds. Place back into stock pot and allow to finish cooking through (another 5 minutes or so). Add the mushrooms and saute until softened (5-6 minutes).Add the wine to the pot to allow it to deglaze the brown bits off the bottom. Simmer for 5-6 minutes. While it is simmering, add both cans of tomatoes and garlic to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Pour mixture into the pot and season with the salt, crushed red pepper, and 2 bay leaves. stir to combine and allow to simmer.While sauce is simmering, preheat oven to 400 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add meatball ingredients to a large bowl and mix well with your (clean) hands. Roll into small 3/4\" diameter balls. Place in oven and bake for 12-15 minutes (until browned on the outside and cooked mostly through). Add meatballs to the sauce and stir. Allow to continue simmer for at least 20-25 minutes (but you can simmer for HOURS if you'd like!).To serve: Remove bay leaves from the sauce. Toss cooked pasta and sauce together (or you can top the pasta with sauce if you prefer). Dish up individual servings and place slices of mozzarella cheese on top. Place in the oven under the broiler until cheese is melted. Serve with crushed red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pasta-with-italian-sausage-meatball-mushroom-and-red-wine-tomato-sauce-498400", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": true, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Recipe Girl", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Garlic-Chicken-Stir-Fry-518266.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 518266, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Garlic Chicken Stir Fry", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 231.69, "creditText": "Recipe Girl", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup cashews", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "cashews", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cashews.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12087, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 pound boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken breasts", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "cut into bite-sized pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 5062, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 Tablespoon cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoon", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "4 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup green onions, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green onions", "metaInformation": ["green", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11291, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground ginger", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2021, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "low sodium chicken broth", "metaInformation": ["low-sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 6970, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 large red or green bell pepper, seeded & chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["green", "red", "large", "seeded", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11821, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 ounces snow peas", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "snow peas", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/snow-peas.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11300, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 Tablespoons soy sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "soy sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "id": 16124, "unit": "Tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 Tablespoons canola or vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "Tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 85.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.recipegirl.com/2007/09/14/garlic-chicken-stir-fry/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "In large skillet, heat 2 Tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add chicken and garlic.
