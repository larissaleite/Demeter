Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Save the \"doughnut hole\" pieces\u2014you can bake these too for little bite-sized treats.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until delicately browned.                                                                                                                             11                                                                            If you want to try to interlink the rounds, go ahead and try the procedure listed here. However, I found that my circles were too fat to be linked, so to form the Olympic rings I simply positioned the rounds in the appropriate order (top row of blue, black, red; bottom row of yellow and green) and trimmed the cookies so that they fit together in a way that suggested linkage. I used a small bit of confectioners' sugar mixed with milk as \"glue\" between the rings. Oh, and don't worry about those little pieces you snip off to make the rings fit together; the excess pieces are excellent to snack on while you work.                                                                                                                            12", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cakespy-olympic-ring-cookies-208330", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 20, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Magnolia Days", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Basic-White-Bread-for--TwelveLoaves-564516.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 564516, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Basic White Bread for #TwelveLoaves", "pricePerServing": 18.19, "creditText": "Magnolia Days", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "active yeast", "metaInformation": ["dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18375, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons shortening (plus more for pans and bowl)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "shortening", "metaInformation": ["plus more for pans and bowl)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4615, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 1/2 to 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unbleached flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.5, "id": 10020081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 cups white whole wheat flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white whole wheat flour", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat", "white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93824, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 cup whole milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whole milk", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 27.0, "sourceUrl": "http://magnoliadays.com/2013/basic-white-bread/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg", "id": 404665, "name": "stand mixer"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Lightly grease two 9- X 5- or 8- X 4-inch loaf bread pans and set aside.
