Place some ice in a small bowl of water and set aside.In a mixing bowl or in the bowl of a food processor, mix just 1 cup of the flour with the salt and sugar. Cut the butter into 1/2'' pieces and then cut into the flour mixture using a rigid pastry cutter or by pulsing the food processor. Once the mixture looks like large crumbs clinging together in clumps, add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour. Mix lightly or pulse the food processor a few times to combine. Do not over mix. The flour should coat the clumps. Sprinkle the ice water over the dough. With your hands or a wooden spoon, mix until the dough holds together, and then form into a disc.Place dough between two pieces of 12'' square parchment paper. Start rolling the dough from the center of the disc outward, turning the dough and parchment as necessary. Continue rolling from center to outer edge until you have a circle shape between 11'' and 12'' in diameter. Peel off the top layer of parchment. Use a pastry cutter or a pizza cutter wheel to cut the circle into 12 pie triangles.Slide dough and parchment, still intact, onto a cookie sheet. Beat egg with 1 tablespoon of water and brush the top of the pie crust. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until crust is nicely browned. Let cool on the cookie sheet. The pie crust triangles should mostly separate during the baking process, but if they need a little help, simply run the pizza cutter or a knife along the cut lines to completely separate. * This can be prepared a few hours prior to serving the assembled dessert.Heat grill or a stove top grill pan to medium heat. Lightly oil the grates/pan.Brush the cut sides of the peaches with a little olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.

Combine seasonings (salt, pepper, smoked paprika, cumin, onion powder, chipotle chili powder, oregano, cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder) together in a bowl and mix until combined. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add oil. Rub the pork all over with a about 1/3 of the seasonings. Once hot, add pork and sear on all sides until golden brown (about 2 minutes per side).Add pork to the crockpot and sprinkle with remaining seasonings all over. Pour in beer, orange juice, lime juice and chipotle chilies, then cook on low for 10-12 hours. Check once or twice if possible. Before serving, use forks or kitchen tongs to shred pork in the crock pot. Mix to combine with the remaining liquid in the crockpot. Keep warm until ready to use.Make the tortilla bowls. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Heat the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. Rub each tortilla with a little olive oil or spray with cooking spray. Sprinkle each tortilla with a little bit of the seasonings. Gently press the tortilla (seasoned side down) around the outside of an oven safe bowl. Place the bowl on a baking sheet and place in the oven an bake for about 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. I only had 2 oven safe bowls, so I made two bowls and then made two more. If you are using only one bowl, repeat until your have four tortilla bowls. Set aside.For the pico de gallo, in a small bowl, mix 1 teaspoon salt with the pinch of sugar. In a medium bowl, toss the tomatoes gently with the salt mixture. Add onion and jalapeno and combine. Place the avocado on top of the tomato mixture and squeeze with lime juice to coat the avocado. Sprinkle on the cilantro, and stir to combine. Set aside until ready to serve.In a small bowl, mix 1 teaspoon salt with the pinch of sugar. In a medium bowl, toss the tomatoes gently with the salt mixture. Add onion and jalapeno and combine. Place the avocado on top of the tomato mixture and squeeze with lime juice to coat the avocado. Sprinkle on the cilantro, and stir to combine.Toss the rice, the cilantro and lime juice.
