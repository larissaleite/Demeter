Set the mold on top of the cooling rack and set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine mascarpone and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, beating on medium-low speed until creamy. Slowly add powdered sugar, beating until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Add vanilla, lemon zest, and salt. Beat until well mixed. Drizzle in heavy cream, in a thin stream, and beat until the cream has thickened to soft peaks.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Scoop the cream into the lined heart mold, making sure to push it down into the corners of the mold. Fold the edges of the cheesecloth over the top of the mold to cover the cream. Make sure that there is space between the mold and the pan beneath it to allow for proper drainage. Slide the baking sheet into the refrigerator and let drain for eight hours, or overnight. Once the cream has drained, discard the runoff liquid and unmold the heart onto a plate.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            For the raspberry sauce: Combine raspberries and sugar in a bowl and stir well, gently mashing the berries to create a little added texture. Cover the bowl and allow to sit for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Drizzle over unmolded coeur \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me and serve immediately (with two spoons!).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/valentines-day-coeur-la-crme-with-raspberries-196741",

Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.In mixer fitted with whip attachment, beat whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until fluffy. Increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat until whites have turned opaque. While whites are beating, slowly add 2 tablespoons sugar and continue to beat to stiff but not dry peak. Transfer beaten whites to a bowl.Using same unwashed mixing bowl and whip, beat yolks and remaining  cup sugar on medium-high speed until light lemon color, 3 to 5 minutes.Gently fold yolks into chocolate mixture until slightly combined while trying not to deflate yolks. Then Gently fold whites into chocolate mixture in three batches, until just combined and no streaks of white remain.Pour batter into pan and bake until cake is puffed, center is jiggly set, and temperature in center reads 150F, about 35-40 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool 1 hour. Chill until set, about 1-2 hours. Run knife along inside edge of pan to release cake. Let cake come to almost room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes. This cake tastes better when served cold.Recipe adapted from serious eats", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baked-chocolate-mousse-cake-669584", "dishTypes": ["dessert"],

Cook potatoes, stirring occasionally, until they are browned. Try to break up potatoes as they cook so they stay in separate strands. They should take 12-15 minutes to brown nicely.3) Meanwhile cook bacon in the oven at 350 degrees until very crispy. For more on how to cook perfect bacon, check out this post.4) Grease a 6-cup muffin tin well and divide potatoes between tins. Leave a well in the center of each tin and make sure potatoes go up the sides to form potato cups.5) Crumble bacon and add about a strip of bacon into each tin.6) Scramble eggs and divide eggs between tins. You shouldn't need a full egg for each tin.7) Season cups with a pinch of salt and pepper and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until eggs are cooked through, about 18-20 minutes.8) When eggs are cooked, run a knife around the outside of each cup and remove each one.
