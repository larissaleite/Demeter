Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.Add 1/2 cup of water and 1/4 cup of uncooked quinoa to a small saucepan and place over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove from heat and stir coconut oil and brown sugar in the pan with the quinoa. Dump on prepared baking sheet and use a spatula to evenly spread quinoa. Place in oven for 15-20 minutes or until quinoa turns golden brown and is crunchy in texture; stir twice throughout the baking time to ensure even toasting. After baking, set aside to cool for two minutes.While quinoa is toasting, you can prepare peanut butter truffles. In a medium bowl, stir together peanut butter, vanilla extract and maple syrup until well combined. Add in oat flour and stir to combine. I like to use my hands here to make sure that the oat flour is evenly distributed and well combined. The dough should be soft. Fold in toasted quinoa -- again I like to use my hands here. Roll dough into 10 balls and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.After peanut butter balls have been frozen and are ready to be coated: melt dark chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat. Once chocolate is melted, dip each ball in chocolate until it is fully coated. Tip: Place a fork under each truffle and gently place the truffle in the melted chocolate. I always have a spoon with me as well to ensure that I can spoon chocolate over the truffle. Lift the truffle up and tap the fork against the top of the saucepan then transfer to a baking sheet and slide fork out. It sound easy, but it can be difficult to get truffles to be pretty looking.Sprinkle truffles with coarse sea salt then place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes or until they harden. Makes 10 truffles.

For a gas grill, turn off half of the burners. Put the onion in a small bowl and cover with cold water; let soak 20 minutes, then drain and squeeze dry. Meanwhile, pulse 1 cup basil, the avocado, garlic, crema and the juice of 1 lime in a blender or mini food processor until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.Tie the beef tenderloin in 2-inch intervals using kitchen twine. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, the cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Brush the oil mixture all over the beef and transfer to the grill over direct heat. Grill, turning occasionally, until the beef is well marked, about 15 minutes. Transfer the beef to the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat) and continue grilling, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 125 degrees F for medium rare, 15 to 20 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.While the beef is cooking over indirect heat, cut a small slit down the center of each plantain and lightly brush the skins with olive oil; transfer to the grill over direct heat. Grill, turning occasionally, until the skins are charred and the plantains are soft, about 20 minutes; cut into thirds.Meanwhile, roughly chop the remaining 2 cups basil; toss with the watermelon, the remaining lime juice and 2 tablespoons olive oil, the cheese, aje peppers and onion in a medium bowl.

Place an oven rack in the lower-middle of the oven.</p><p>Trim the pork: Trim off any large pieces of fat from the outside, but leave small pieces and the interior fat. If using boneless pork, cut the pork into several large fist-sized pieces. If using bone-in, leave the pork as is, on the bone.</p><p>Season the pork: Sprinkle the pork with salt, pepper, and spices. Rub the seasoning into the pork with your fingers so that the meat is evenly coated on all sides.</p><p>Sear the pork (optional): If you have time, searing will deepen the final flavor of your pork and give it some textural contrast. Warm the oil in the Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the pork on all sides, working in batches as necessary so as not to crowd the pan. For more detailed step-by-step instructions, see How To Sear Meat.</p><p>Add the vegetables (if using): Onions, garlic, and other vegetables also deepen the final flavor of the pork, but are optional.

Total cooking time will be 2 to 4 hours depending on the amount of pork and whether it's bone-in (which takes longer to cook).
