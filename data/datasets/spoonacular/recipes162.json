Drizzle half of bourbon mixture on sliced peaches and remaining half on diced peaches. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar on sliced peaches and remaining 2 tablespoons on diced peaches. Toss peaches to coat an rearrange in single layer. Roast until peaches are tender and liquid is syrupy, about 15 minutes, alternating baking sheets\u2019 positions halfway through. Transfer to cooling rack and cool completely, about 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            For the Crust: Decrease oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and adjust oven rack to middle position. Line exterior of springform pan with foil. Combine cracker crumbs, pecans, melted butter, brown sugar, and salt in medium bowl, stirring until crumbs are thoroughly saturated with butter. Press onto bottom and up sides of pan, leaving about 1/2 inch from top of pan.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Bake crust until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack and cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            For the Cheesecake Filling: Decrease oven temperature to 275\u00b0F. In large, clean, dry bowl, whip egg whites and vanilla bean seeds on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. If using the stand mixer bowl, transfer whites to separate bowl and wipe out bowl.                                                                                                                              7                                                                            Beat cream cheese, egg yolks, and flour on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add cream and continue beating until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes longer, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary. Stir in diced peaches.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Stir 1/3 of egg whites into cream cheese mixture, then, gently fold in remaining egg whites. Scrape batter into cooled crust and bake until cheesecake is set but still slightly wobbly in the center, 75 to 90 minutes. Shut oven off and let cheesecake sit in oven 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Transfer cheesecake to cooling rack and cool for 1 hour. Transfer to refrigerator and cool until completely chilled and set, at least 3 hours. Remove from springfrom mold and set on serving dish.
