Don't worry about any cracks in the bottom; they will be patched in the next step.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For the Filling: Melt 2 ounces chocolate in a small metal bowl placed over a small saucepan of simmering water, or by microwaving in a microwave-safe bowl in increments of 30 seconds, stirring in between. Once chocolate is fully melted, pour into cooled shell and spread with a small offset spatula or small spoon until the bottom is fully coated and any cracks are patched. While chocolate is still wet, press in crushed pretzels. Refrigerate until chocolate is set.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place remaining chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not quite boiling. Pour over chocolate and butter and immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap and gently stir with a whisk until all chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth. Slowly pour into shell and carefully place in fridge to set, 1 to 2 hours.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While ganache sets, prepare caramel cream: Place sugar in a small saucepan and add water to moisten. Set over medium heat until sugar caramelizes and turns amber (color should be between honey and maple syrup), gently swirling the pan to ensure even caramelization and using a wet brush to wipe down sides of saucepan if any sugar crystals start to form. Remove from heat and slowly pour in 1/2 cup of cream. Caramel will seize and sputter so be careful. Place caramel over low heat and stir until melted, then pour into a small bowl and refrigerate until cold and you are ready to serve the tart.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Test your ganache for doneness every 15 minutes or so once it begins to set and is no longer liquid. Lightly press a fingertip onto the middle of the tart; if it gives at all keep waiting. It's ready when it's solid but slightly soft. If it gets completely hard, remove from refrigerator and allow to temper briefly at room temperature until slightly softened. Cut into 10 slices with a large chef's knife, starting by rocking through the outer crust and then leaning the blade straight down through the ganache and lower crust. Wipe knife clean with a hot moist towel in between slices. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When you are ready to serve, remove desired amount of tart slices from the refrigerator to temper and prepare the caramel cream. In a large bowl, whip 3/4 cup cream to stiff peaks. Fold in chilled caramel, salt to taste and re-whip back to stiff peaks. Pipe or scoop on plates next to slices of tart.Leftover cream and tart will keep in airtight containers for 2-3 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-pretzel-tart-205069", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 180, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pork--green-bean---oyster-stir-fry-210792.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 210792, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Pork, green bean & oyster stir-fry", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 129.4, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "140g green beans, halved", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green beans", "metaInformation": ["green", "halved"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 140.0, "id": 11052, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp lime juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9160, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "75ml oyster sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "oyster sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oyster-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "milliliters", "unitShort": "ml", "amount": 75.0, "id": 6176, "unit": "ml"}, {"originalString": "400g pork fillet, cut into thin slices", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "pork", "metaInformation": ["cut into thin slices"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 400.0, "id": 10010219, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 red onion, cut into chunky pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["red", "cut into chunky pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tsp soy sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "soy sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16124, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp chilli bean paste or chilli sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sweet chilli sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fish-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 98962, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "tbsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 64.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1813671/pork-green-bean-and-oyster-stirfry", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a small bowl, mix together the lime juice, chilli bean paste, oyster sauce and half the soy sauce.

Stir in the remaining sugar and return to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for one minute. Remove the pot from the stove and skim any foam from the surface of the jam with a metal spoon. Remove and discard the vanilla bean.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe rims of the jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight. Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
