Yield: 2/3 cupRecipe from \"New New Orleans Cooking\", by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie TirschPublished by William and Morrow, 1993.                                                Green Beans Almandine:                                        1 pound green beans5 cups water 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter1 (2 1/4-ounce) package sliced almonds2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper Trim the green beans by snapping the ends off. Place the water and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a medium, heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Carefully add the beans and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Using oven mitts or pot holders, remove the saucepan from the heat, and drain the beans in a colander set in the sink, pouring away from you. Rinse under cold running water and drain. Melt the butter in the same 3 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the almonds, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper. Cook, stirring, until the almonds are toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the drained green beans to the pan and cook, stirring, until well coated with sauce and warmed through, about 1 minute. Using an oven mitt or pot holder, remove from the heat and serve.

Line two 12-cup standard muffin tins with cupcake liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.Combine the butter, granulated sugar, sour cream, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 21 to 23 minutes, rotating the pans once about halfway through baking. Cool the cupcakes in the pans for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.For the frosting: Beat the butter, peanut butter, vanilla and salt using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes more.For the assembly and decorating: Put 1 cup of frosting in a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and set aside. Put the jimmies in a shallow bowl. Frost a cupcake, using about 2 tablespoons of the remaining frosting per cupcake, and then gently dipping the top into the jimmies, turning the cupcake until the top is coated. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes. Arrange the cupcakes in 4 rows on a large serving plate or cutting board. Fit a marshmallow between each cupcake, 5 marshmallows per row, to fill in the gaps between the cupcakes in the rows. Using the frosting in the piping bag, pipe thick cross shapes between where the cupcakes meet one another and over the marshmallows so there are no visible gaps between the cupcakes. Sprinkle with jimmies to coat.To make goal posts for the cupcake \"field,\" microwave the chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl until just melted, 30 to 45 seconds.  Keep 2 cookie sticks whole for the bases of the posts. Cut off and discard (or eat!) the bottom third of the remaining cookie sticks. Dip the top of one of the longest cookie sticks into the melted chocolate and adhere it to the middle of one of the cut cookie sticks so that they form a capital T shape. Next, dip the cut ends of two short sticks into chocolate and adhere them to either side of the cross on the T. Lay the goal post on a flat surface and repeat with the remaining 4 cookie sticks to make the second goal. Allow goals to fully harden, 15 to 20 minutes, or place in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.Using the decorators' icing, pipe 10 lines across the cupcake field to represent yard lines. Pipe out the number 50 in the middle for the 50-yard line. Heat the Tootsie Rolls in the microwave on high in 5-second intervals until they are soft and pliable. Mash them together and form into a football. Use the icing to pipe the lacing on the football; use a toothpick if necessary to help define the lacing. Place the football on the field. Place the gummy candies on the field to represent players and then stick the goal posts into cupcakes at each end of the field.

Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. If you used the stand mixer bowl, transfer whites to separate bowl.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Beat butter and lemon sugar with paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in three additions, alternating with milk mixture. Fold in egg whites and divide batter equally between prepared pans.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bake until tester inserted in center of cakes comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer cakes to cooling racks and cool 10 minutes in pans. Turn cakes out directly onto racks, peel off and discard parchment, then invert so the tops are facing up. Cool completely, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            For the Meyer Lemon Curd: Pulse the zest and sugar in food processor until no zest strands remain and sugar is damp and yellow.  Alternatively, rub the zest into the sugar with fingertips.                                                                                                                                8                                                                            Whisk the lemon sugar, cornstarch, eggs, egg yolks, and salt together in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add juice and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and the consistency of pudding, 8 to 10 minutes. Once mixture reaches the boil, continue cooking and whisking for 2 minutes longer.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Strain curd into medium bowl. Add butter and stir until completely incorporated. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard and refrigerate until completely chilled. Alternatively, place bowl in ice bath and stir constantly until custard is completely cooled, about 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            To Assemble: With a serrated knife, cut each cake in half to create 4 equal layers. Place one layer on a serving dish or cake stand and spread with one third (about 1/2 cup) of cooled curd. Repeat with remaining cake layers and curd.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Sift confectioners\u2019 sugar over cake.
