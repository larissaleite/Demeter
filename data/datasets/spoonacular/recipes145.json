Let the truffles set at room temperature or place them in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.                                                                                                                              12                                                                            Serve the truffles at room temperature.                                                                                                                            13                                                                            Note on storing the truffles: Store the truffles between layers of waxed paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 1 month. To freeze up to 2 months, wrap the container tightly in several layers of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Use a large piece of masking tape and an indelible marker to label the contents.
