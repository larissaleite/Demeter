Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are caramelized - they will be a deep golden color. (This step could take as little as 40 minutes or as long as 2 hours.)Once the oxtail is done, remove it from the slow cooker and transfer to a plate; shred the meat away from the bones with a fork. Skim the fat from the liquid in the slow cooker, if desired, and transfer the contents along with the meat from the oxtail to the pan with the onions.Cook the stew over medium heat for about half an hour. Remove the thyme stems and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over Gruyere-mashed potatoes or cauliflower.Nutrition (per serving): 437 calories, 27.5g total fat, 78.6mg cholesterol, 529.1mg sodium, 951.1mg potassium, 19.2g carbohydrates, 2.7g fiber, 7.7g sugar, 22.3g protein", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/french-onion-oxtail-stew-476876", "dishTypes": ["soup"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Budget Bytes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/homemade-pineapple-orange-julius-801361.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 801361, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Homemade Pineapple Orange Julius", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 9.88, "creditText": "Budget Bytes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup whole milk $0.31", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup orange juice concentrate $0.33", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "orange juice concentrate", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 9214, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup frozen pineapple $0.58", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "pineapple", "metaInformation": ["frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9266, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp sugar* $0.01", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp vanilla extract $0.14", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 42.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/09/homemade-pineapple-orange-julius/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}], "step": "Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and frothy.
