Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan and an 8-inch square baking pan. Line the baking pan (but not the springform) with parchment or waxed paper, leaving a 1-inch overhang over the sides. Wrap the outside of the springform with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.Make the brownie2. Melt the chocolate with the butter and let cool. In a small bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a large bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer on high until light yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar, then the chocolate mix\u00adture and vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and blend in the flour mixture just until it disappears.3. Spread 2 cups of the batter in the springform to make the crust and the rest in the baking pan. Bake just until set around the sides, about 10 minutes for the crust and 25 minutes for the baking pan. (The centers will be slightly soft.) Let cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Leave the brownie crust in the springform. Lift the brownies out of the square pan onto a plate, using the paper hanging over the sides as handles. Cover both the crust and the square of brownies with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.4. Cut the square of brownies with a serrated knife into 1-inch squares and set aside.Make the cheesecake5. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl.

Use a rubber spatula to transfer the batter to a piping bag, fitted with a 1/2\" plain tip.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pipe and bake the cookies:Pipe the cookies into 1\" wide rounds on the prepared cookie sheets. Don't worry if they have little peaks, you'll fix those later. Just try to keep the cookies all roughly the same size to ensure even baking. Once all of the cookies have been piped, brush each one lightly with a pastry brush dipped in cream. You're not looking to coat the cookies, but to smooth the peaks down and give them an even, smooth surface texture.Once the cookies have been brushed, bake approximately 18 minutes or until the cookies are firm to the touch and golden brown. To make perfectly round wafers, use a 1 1/2\" cookie cutter to trim each cookie before they cool.Transfer the cookies, while still slightly warm, to an airtight container and seal. This will slightly steam the cookies and give them that less than crisp Nilla texture. If you prefer a crisper wafer, allow the cookies to cool completely before storing. The cookies will keep, at room temperature, for several weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/nilla-knockoffs-205704", "dishTypes": ["antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 100, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
