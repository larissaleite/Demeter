Butter a 2-quart casserole and set aside.Heat a medium size skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the chopped country ham in the pan and brown until some of the pieces are slightly crispy and the fatty pieces begin to brown.  Set the pan aside, leaving the meat in the rendered fat.Place sliced potatoes, chicken broth, whole milk, and bay leaf in a medium saucepan.  Bring the liquids to a boil and simmer for just a few minutes (3 - 5 minutes) until the potatoes start to become tender, occasionally basting the potatoes with the liquids so they do not dry out. Do not overcook or else they will become mushy.  Drain most of the liquid from the saucepan, reserving some to keep the potatoes moist.Layer half of the potatoes on the bottom of the casserole dish, covering the entire bottom.  Sprinkle potatoes with about 2/3 of the cooked country ham pieces, the thinly sliced onion, and 1 cup of the shredded Jarlsberg cheese.  Layer the remaining half of the potatoes evenly over the top, sprinkle the rest of the country ham over the potatoes, and finish with the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese.  Pour the heavy cream over the top of the whole casserole and press the mixture down so that it flattens slightly and moistens the ingredients.Bake at 375 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes until mixture is bubbling and the top is nicely browned.  Let sit about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/country-potato-gratin-575470", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,

Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 200 degrees. Once the oven temperature reaches 200 degrees, maintain the heat for 10 minutes, then turn off the oven.2. Mix 3\u00bd cups of the flour and the salt in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix the milk, water, butter, honey, and yeast in a 4-cup liquid measuring cup. Turn the machine to low and slowly add the liquid. When the dough comes together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and satiny, stopping the machine two or three times to scrape dough from hook, if necessary, about 10 minutes. (After 5 minutes of kneading, if the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time and up to \u00bc cup total, until the dough is no longer sticky.) Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface; knead to form a smooth, round ball, about 15 seconds.3. Place the dough in a very lightly oiled large bowl, rubbing the dough around the bowl to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the warmed oven until the dough doubles in size, 40 to 50 minutes.4. Gently press the dough into a rectangle 1 inch thick and no longer than 9 inches. WIth a long side facing you, roll the dough firmly into a cylinder, pressing with your fingers to make sure the dough sticks to itself. Turn the dough seam-side up and pinch it closed. Place the dough seam-side down in a greased 9 by 5-inch loaf pan and press it gently so it touches all four sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap; set aside in a warm spot until the dough almost doubles in size, 20 to 30 minutes.5. Keep one oven rack at the lowest position and place the other at the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Place an empty baking pan on the bottom rack. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the boiling water into the empty pan on the bottom rack at set the loaf onto the middle rack. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted at an angle from the short end just above the pan rim into the center of the loaf read 195 degrees, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan, transfer to a wire rack, and cool to room temperature. Slice and serve.Note: This recipe uses a standing electric mixer.
