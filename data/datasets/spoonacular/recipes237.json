Season with salt and pepper.Add in the worcestershire sauce, beef broth and 2 tbsp of the spiced ketchup and stir to combine. Let simmer until mixture thickens and no liquid remains. Once done, turn off the heat and leave in the skillet.As the sloppy joe mixture simmers, remove the cans and paper from the two ramekins. Place another large skillet over medium-low heat and add in the olive oil. Very carefully, over the skillet, turn one ramekin over and tap the bottom with one hand until the noodles come out. Repeat for the other ramekin.Cook (without moving) the noodle buns for about 3-4 minutes and then flip over and cook an additional 2-3 minutes or until all noodles are compact. There will be a slight char on both sides.Place each noodle bun on a separate plate and smear with the other tbsp of spiced ketchup. Top with the sloppy joe mixture.

In the medium mixing bowl, stir together 1/2 cup vegetable oil, half of the saffron water, and 1 1/2 cups of the cooked rice.Spread the oil and rice mixture in an even layer on the bottom of the pot. This will become your tahdig. Scoop the rest of the rice out of the colander and into the pot, forming a volcano-shaped mound in the middle of the pot. Make a hole in the center of the volcano with the handle of a wooden spoon, pushing it almost to the bottom of the pot.Place a thin kitchen towel over the top of the pot, being careful not to let the towel get too close to the heat source. Place the lid tightly over the top of the towel. Turn on the heat to medium and let the rice steam for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, mix together the remaining saffron water with remaining 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. After 10 minutes, remove the towel and lid from the pot and pour the saffron oil mixture evenly over the top of the rice.Replace the towel and lid. Turn heat to low. Let the mixture steam for 45-50 minutes longer.Move the pot to a cool surface and let it rest for 5 minutes. When ready to serve, you have two options. Option 1: Scoop the rice out of the pot and mound it onto a serving plate or tray, leaving a thin layer of rice undisturbed at the bottom of the pot. Use a spatula to loosen the crispy tahdeeg from the bottom of the pot and arrange the pieces around the cooked rice. Garnish with a little fresh dill, if desired.Option 2: Place a large serving plate upside down on top of the pot. Invert the pot quickly and gently unmold the rice from the pot. This will keep the tahdig intact and create a cake-like effect with the rice.Serve hot.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/persian-dill-and-lima-bean-rice-533168", "dishTypes":
