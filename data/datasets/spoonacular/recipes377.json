Refrigerate until cooled and thickened slightly (almost to the consistency of a gel but still runny-you can check a few times to see), 15 to 20 minutes.Meanwhile, slice off the bottom tip of each strawberry so there is a flat edge for it to stand upright; be careful to not cut off so much that there is a hole at the bottom once the strawberry is cored.Use a strawberry huller or small melon baller to core out the strawberry, again, making sure you don't dig so deep that you create a hole in the bottom.Spoon the champagne mixture into the strawberries and stand them in a baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Garnish with mint leaves and serve.

Turn it over, and cut eight X's about 2 inches apart with a sharp knife. Open up each X with your fingers so it will securely hold an ice cream cone upright.Cook the chocolate, coconut oil and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.Pour about 1 tablespoon of melted chocolate into a sugar cone, and swirl to completely coat the inside. Pour any excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the cone in the cone holder. Repeat with the 7 remaining cones. Freeze the cones to set the chocolate, about 10 minutes.Fill each cone to the top with ice cream, and top with an additional 1/3-cup scoop. Return the cones to the cone holder, and freeze to harden the ice cream, about 30 minutes.Dip the cones: Put your desired topping in a small bowl. If the remaining chocolate starts to solidify, heat it in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring in between, until it is fluid again. Dip each top scoop of ice cream in the chocolate to mostly cover it, leaving a little bit exposed. Let any excess chocolate drip off, then immediately dip the top scoop in the topping. Work quickly, as the chocolate shell sets in seconds.Serve the cones immediately, or put them in the freezer until ready to serve. To freeze individually (for up to 2 weeks), roll the cone up in a large triangle of wax paper and tape closed.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.
