Cover, remove from the heat, and let steep for at least 30 minutes.3. Strain the warm nut mixture, pressing on the nuts to extract as much liquid as possible, and discard the solids. Return the milk and cream mixture to the saucepan. Pour the remaining 1 cup cream into a large bowl and set a mesh strainer on top. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.4. Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. Pour the custard through the strainer and stir it into the cream. Add the vanilla extract and almond extract and stir until combined.5. Refrigerate until cold. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.

Butter and flour a 9 x 12 x 1\u00bd-inch baking pan.Melt the butter, 8 ounces of the chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate together in a medium bowl set over simmering water. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs, coffee, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature (see note below).In a medium bowl, sift together \u00bd cup of the flour, the baking powder, and salt and add to the chocolate mixture. Toss the remaining 6 ounces of chocolate chips and the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour in a medium bowl and add them to the chocolate mixture. Spread evenly in the prepared pan.Bake for 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Don't overbake!As soon as the brownies are out of the oven, place the jar of caramel sauce without the lid in a microwave and heat just until it's pourable. Stir until smooth. Drizzle the caramel evenly over the hot brownies and sprinkle with the sea salt. Cool completely and cut into 12 bars.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Lightly grease a 9x13 pan.In a medium sized microwave-safe bowl or in a saucepan, melt the butter on low heat, then add the sugar and stir to combine.Return the mixture to the heat or microwave briefly, just until it's hot but not bubbling. It will become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the butter and sugar a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.Transfer the mix to a mixing bowl.Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder, and vanilla.Add the eggs, beating till smooth; then add the flour and chips and nuts if using. Beat until well combined.Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.Bake the brownies for 28-30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs clinging to it.The brownies should feel set both around the edges and in the center.Remove from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges with a table knife, this will help prevent the brownies from sinking in the center as they cool.Cool for 15- 20 min then drizzle the caramel sauce over and sprinkle sea salt on top of the caramel sauceCool completely before cutting and serving.</p>",

Allow it to sit and soften. Make sure your whisk attachment is connected.In the meantime, combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Clip a candy thermometer to the pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, avoid stirring once it starts to bubble. Allow to boil until the thermometer registers 238\u00b0F. Remove from heat.Turn your mixer on low speed, then very carefully pour the hot syrup into the gelatine mixture in a slow and steady stream down the side of the bowl. Once it has all been added, increase to high and continue to beat until the mixture is very thick and forms ribbons, 10-12 minutes.Working VERY quickly, use an oiled rubber spatula to scrape the whole thing into your prepared pan and smooth the top of the mixture.Let stand at room temperature until the top is no longer sticky, 2-3 hours.Run an oiled knife around the edges of the pan. Scoop some powdered sugar into a strainer and dust a large cutting board with it. Flip the marshmallow slab out of the pan and onto the prepared cutting board. Dust the top with a good coat of powdered sugar, then cut the marshmallow slab into squares (or however you like). Dust your knife with powdered sugar, as needed. Once again, dust the marshmallows with powdered sugar, turning to coat all of the sides.Store the marshmallows in single layers between sheets of parchment paper in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to 1 week.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chambord-marshmallows-boozy-good-fun-607438", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 210, "servings": 25, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Shiksa in the Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Gluten-Free-Matzo-Balls---Potato-Knaidelach-195453.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 195453, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Gluten Free Matzo Balls - Potato Knaidelach", "creditText": "The Shiksa in the Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 1/2-2 cups blanched almond meal", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "almond meal", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 93740, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "Make sure your potato starch and almond meal are certified GF.", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "almond meal", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 93740, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Potato masher", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potato", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 11362, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup potato starch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "potato starch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11413, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Potatoes must chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours prior to assembling.", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potatoes", "metaInformation": ["for at least 2 hours prior to assembling."], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 11362, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 lbs large red potatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red potatoes", "metaInformation": ["red", "large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10011355, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "Salt and white pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 48.0, "sourceUrl": "http://theshiksa.com/2011/04/06/gluten-free-potato-knaidelach/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 958, "instructions": "Save RecipePrint Recipe                          Gluten Free Matzo Balls - Potato Knaidelach                                        Ingredients2 lbs large red potatoes 1 egg1/4 cup potato starch1 1/2-2 cups blanched almond mealSalt and white pepperYou will also needPotato masherPrep NotePotatoes must chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours prior to assembling.Make sure your potato starch and almond meal are certified GF.

Coat large saute pan with oil.  Season chicken with salt and  pepper. Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side or until no longer pink. Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder and Mexican spices before turning. Remove chicken to a platter, allow  to cool.Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender. Add corn  and chiles. Stir well to combine. Add canned tomatoes, saute 1  minute.Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips. Add shredded  chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables. Dust the mixture with  flour to help set.Microwave tortillas on high for 30  seconds. This softens them and  makes them more pliable. Coat the  bottom of 2 (13 by 9-inch) pans  with a ladle of enchilada sauce. Using a large shallow bowl, dip  each tortilla in enchilada sauce to lightly coat. Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture in each tortilla. Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with seam  side down. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese.Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F oven until cheese melts. Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped tomatoes  before serving. Serve with Spanish rice and beans.

Toss well and cook until the corn is warm and the garlic is sauted, about 2 minutes. Remove the corn and place it in the bowl of a food processor.Add the ricotta, salt, pepper and juice of two limes to the processor as well. Puree until combined and smooth. Taste and season additionally if needed. I continually scraped down the sides and pureed so the mixture would resemble a smooth hummus. If the dip won't smooth out easily, add a tablespoon of ice water at a time and blend again.Scoop the dip into a bowl or deep plate.

Preheat the broiler.Place the eggs in a shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan and some salt and pepper. Coat each slice of eggplant with the eggs, and then dredge through the breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere. (The eggplant slices can be frozen at this point for later use.)Fry the eggplant slices in batches until brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat for the remaining slices. Spread the bottom half of a roll with 1/4 cup of the marinara. Place 3 slices of the fried eggplant on top, another 1/4 cup of the marinara and finish with one-quarter of the mozzarella. Repeat for the remaining rolls. Broil the sandwiches until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot.

"instructions": "Lightly grease six 3-1/2-Inch fluted mini tart or brioche molds and place them on a sheet pan for easier maneuvering. Set aside.In a small saucepan, vigorously whisk together the agar, \u201cmilk,\u201d and sugar until there are no lumps remaining. Set the pan over medium-low heat, and gently whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken. Take the pan off the stove to stir in both the \u201csour cream\u201d and coconut yogurt, mixing until smooth, and then return it to the heat very briefly. Cook the mixture just until bubbles begin to slowly break on the surface, whisking the whole time. Add in the rose water and vanilla, whisk to incorporate, and quickly transfer the contents of the saucepan to your prepared molds. Gently tap each one on the counter to knock out any air bubbles before smoothing out the tops with a spatula. Let cool completely at room temperature before thoroughly chilling.For the hibiscus sauce, plunk the tea bags into the water in a small saucepan. Place it on the stove over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat and cover, allowing the tea to steep for 20 to 30 minutes. Once deeply rose red in hue, remove the tea bags and allow the excess liquid to drip out, but do not squeeze them- This will cloud the mixture. Separately, stir together the sugar, orange zest, and cornstarch until thoroughly combined, and add these dry goods into the saucepan. Return it to the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid bubbling and fully thickened. Let cool before chilling in the fridge.To make the almond brittle, begin by combining the sugar, water, corn syrup, cinnamon, and salt in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Resist the urge to stir, and gently swirl the pan to mix the contents instead. Bring the mixture up to a boil, and continue to cool until the sugar caramelizes and turns a pale amber color. Meanwhile, set out a silpat or piece of parchment paper nearby where the brittle can come to rest. Once the sugar syrup has reached the right shade of golden brown, quickly stir in the sliced almonds to coat them evenly in the mixture, and waste no time in pouring everything onto your prepared silpat or parchment. Smooth out the brittle into as thin a layer as possible. Let cool completely before breaking it into pieces.To serve, spoon about 1/4 \u2013 1/3 cup of the hibiscus sauce onto the plate, and turn out one panna cotta on top. Wedge a piece of the almond brittle into the crest of the panna cotta, fan out three citrus surpremes alongside, and sprinkle pomegranate arils on top. Finish it all off with a few mint leaves to garnish.

"instructions": "Place corned beef and any liquid from the bag into an 8 quart pot and fill with cold water. Bring to a boil and skim off foam that floats to the top. Reduce to a medium simmer and cook uncovered for three hours, replacing hot water every 30 minutes or so to keep water to the top. After three hours, let sit in water off burner for 15 minutes then remove to a sheet tray. The spice bag mix does not get used while the corned beef is cooking. Corned beef has enough flavor on its own and you want the taste of the meat to shine.OK, here is trick number one. In food service, we would cook the corned beef the day prior, place in the cooler with a heavy weight on top and the next day, any grains of heavy fat intermingled throughout the meat would be squeezed out yielding a less fatty looking slice. To do this at home and to show the difference, I cut the cooked roast in half and left one un-pressed and pressed the other by putting a second sheet pan over the top and topping with a heavy Dutch oven filled with some water. That whole set up is then placed in the refrigerator overnight. This step is not totally necessary but I wanted to show the difference. Once the meat is hot, you really cant see the fat and as a bonus, fat tastes good. So this is your choice here. There should be about 6 quarts of liquid left in the pot and this will be flavored now with the spice bag.Lay out a double layer of cheese cloth and fill with peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, all spice berries, fresh ginger, cinnamon stick and pepper flakes. Pull up sides and tie with butchers twine. (Alternately, you can just use a commercial pickling spice mix).Bring the pot back to a boil and place the spice bag into the pot. Boil for ten minutes, then remove and discard the spice bag. It has served its purpose.To avoid over cooked vegetables, I actually took the time and effort here to cook each vegetable separate so that I could give you the exact time that each vegetable takes to be perfectly cooked but not over cooked. You of course wont be doing that, unless you want to of course, so just use this as a timing guide. Below I list each vegetable with how to prepare and the exact time to cook.Bring the 8 quart pot with the now flavored liquid to a boil to start cooking the vegetables. Based on the timing below, you can place vegetables in the order of the length of time they take to cook, ending with the vegetable that takes the least time to cook. I list each below.Cabbage: Cut the end off the cabbage but do not core. We leave the core attached so that the cooked cabbage stays in wedges without falling apart. Remove any discolored outer leaves and cut the cabbage in half through the center of the core. Then cut each half in half keeping the core intact for each piece. Finally cut each quarter in half again keeping core attached to each wedge. Place in boiling liquid. The liquid will take about eight minutes to come back to a boil and only about four or five additional minutes to cook.Potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut in quarters if large or thirds or halves if small. Place in boiling liquid. The liquid will take two minutes to come back to a boil and 15 minutes to cook.Onions: Cut top and bottom off and peel but leave whole. If you cut them, they fall apart and are hard to fish out after. Place in boiling liquid and cook for 25 minutes including the time it takes to come back to a boil.Parsnips: Cut off ends and cut on the bias into uniform sized pieces. They should be large enough to be more than a mouthful but not left whole. Place in boiling liquid and cook about 8 minutes including time to come back to a boil.Turnip: Cut off both ends and peel completely down to white or yellow meat. Make sure all skin and green inner lining is peeled off. Cut into 2-3 inch chunks and place into boiling liquid. Cook for 15-18 minutes including time to come back to a boil.Yellow or orange beets (not red): Peel and quarter. Place in boiling water and cook for 15 minutes including time to come back to a boil.Carrots: Peel, cut ends off and cut into similar size and shape as parsnips. Place in boiling water and cook for ten minutes including time for liquid to come back to a boil.If cooking all vegetables in the same pot, the order would be as follows: onions, potatoes, turnip, beets, cabbage, carrots and parsnips, letting each cook for a bit before adding the next. I prefer cooking each separately, but only because I am very finicky about over cooked vegetables and I like serving them separate to give dinner guests or family the chance to select what they want.At this point, you can refrigerate everything including the rest of the liquid and get back at it just before dinner that day or the next day. There should be two quarts of liquid left. If you have less, just add enough water to bring it back to two quarts.About an hour before dinner is to be served, place each cooked vegetable in a large roasting pan or similar type of vessel.Heat the 2 quarts of liquid and pour half over the vegetables. Cover the top of the roasting pan with a lid, an inverted sheet pan or foil and place over two burners. Bring the heat to a medium flame with both burners and gently heat the vegetables back up. This will take 15-20 minutes to heat them through. Keep covered so no moisture escapes.Here is another great tip. By now you were probably wondering what the corn starch was for. Basically we are going to make a glaze to heat the meat and serve over the vegetables as they are served. The glaze gives everything a nice tasty glisten and is great to sop up with bread.Mix the corn starch with a few drops of water to form a slurry and add it the remaining quart of hot stock. Heat and stir until thickened to a light syrupy consistency.Place the cold corned beef on your cutting board and remove any visible fat. Slice in thick slices against the grain.Place a large skillet, fry pan or cast iron skillet over a burner and place in sliced corned beef along with half the thickened liquid and turn on the burner. Cover and heat over medium until just hot.Finally to serve (bet you thought we would never get there), place hot meat and vegetables on each dinner plate and spoon a little of the remaining hot thickened liquid over each. If serving family style, transfer meat and vegetables to a platter and spoon or brush the tops with the glaze.Serve with nice crusty bread or a hearty rye. By the way, this meal lends itself to great leftovers.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/new-england-boiled-dinner-corned-beef-and-cabbage-715142", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 300, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simply Sugar and Gluten Free", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Icebox-Cake-with-Carob-Chip-Cookies-539697.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 539697, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Icebox Cake with Carob Chip Cookies", "creditText": "Simply Sugar and Gluten Free", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dutch processed cocoa powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dutch-process-cocoa-powder.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 10019165, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 cups heavy cream, cold", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": ["cold"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon instant decaf coffee granules", "aisle": "Tea and Coffee", "name": "instant coffee granules", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-coffee-or-instant-espresso.png", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 14214, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "pinch of kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1/4 + 1/8 teaspoon liquid vanilla stevia", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "liquid stevia", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/stevia-drops.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10811111, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "12 ounces part-skim ricotta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "part-skim ricotta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 1037, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 \u2013 2 pounds gluten-free, sugar-free carob chip cookies", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "chocolate chip cookies", "metaInformation": ["gluten-free", "sugar-free"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortbread-cookies.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10118192, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 42.0, "sourceUrl": "http://simplysugarandglutenfree.com/icebox-cake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 21, "aggregateLikes": 119, "instructions": "Put heavy cream, ricotta, cocoa powder, stevia, decaf coffee granules, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment.

Set aside.Add the sugar, coconut, and lime zest to a small food processor and blend until the coconut is finely chopped and the sugar is fragrant.Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, or use a hand mixer (I got a better dome with the hand mixer). Add the coconut oil, sugar mixture, and lime juice to the bowl and beat at medium speed for 3 minutes, or until light. Scrape the sides as necessary.Add one third of the flour mixture while beating on medium speed, again scraping the sides as needed. Beat in half of the sour cream mixture. Alternately add the remaining flour mixture and sour cream until all the wet and dry ingredients have added, beating until the batter fully incorporated and smooth.Use a large scoop (about 3 tablespoons), evenly divide the batter between 20-24 lined muffin tins filling each about 2/3 of the way full.Bake for 15-24 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers come out clean. Cool on wire rack.For the FrostingIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese and coconut oil.Beat until fluffy. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time while continuing to beat. Add as much powdered sugar as you would like until your desired frosting consistency is reached.Once well blended, add in the lime juice and coconut milk. Mix on low speed until well combined and moist. If desired, an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut milk until your desired consistency is reached. Beat at high speed until frosting is smooth and fluffy.Frost the cooled cupcakes and sprinkle with shredded coconut (toasted or untoasted) if desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
