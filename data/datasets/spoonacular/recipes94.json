sugar and powdered sugar until well combined. Mix in egg, vanilla extract and almond extract. With mixer set on low speed, slowly add in flour mixture and mix until combined. Divide mixture into 2 equal portions, shape each portion into a smooth 6-inch disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill 1 1/2 hours, or until firm (you can chill overnight then let rest on counter about 5 minutes if it's too firm to roll). Preheat oven to 350 degrees during last 10 minutes of chilling. Dust a clean work surface with flour then place one disk of dough on floured surface, dust top lightly with flour and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness (leave dough disk chilled that you aren't currently working with). Cut into mini animal shapes (I used these here) then transfer (use an offset spatula to help lift them from surface if needed)to a baking sheet lined with a silicone liner or parchment paper, leaving about 3/4-inch between cookies. Bake in preheated oven about 7 - 11 minutes until set (meanwhile gather scraps of dough, mash and shape into smooth disk again and refrigerate). Remove from oven and cool several minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Repeat with remaining disk of dough.For the icing option 1:In a medium mixing bowl whisk together powdered sugar, vanilla and enough half and half or cream to reach a medium consistency (not runny, not thick). Divide mixture evenly among two bowls, tint one of them with pink coloring and leave the other white. Spread over cookies and immediately sprinkle with sprinkles after frosting each one. Let rest until glaze has set.Icing option 2:Melt candy melts in small batches (about 2 oz at a time so it doesn't harden too quickly) as directed on package. Tint half of the melts with pink coloring. Spread over cookies (or dip and slide some of the excess off on the side of bowl) and immediately sprinkle with sprinkles after frosting each one. Let rest until icing has set.Recipe source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-circus-animal-cookies-728818", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 130, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Crock Pot Ladies", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Crock-Pot-Creamy-Chicken-Tortilla-Soup-628880.png", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 628880, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Crock-Pot Creamy Chicken Tortilla Soup", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Crock Pot Ladies", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 Cups Black Beans (drained)", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "black beans", "metaInformation": ["black", "drained", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "Cups", "unitShort": "Cups", "amount": 2.0, "id": 16015, "unit": "Cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 Tsp.

Feel free to play around with different types of salami for this recipe. I'm lucky to live in the hometown of Salumi, the little sliver of meat-lover's heaven here in Seattle, founded by master salumist Armandino Batali and carried on today by his daughter Gina Batali and son-in-law Brian D'Amato. I love the results from crisping up the sopressata and finocchiona from Salumi for this snack. I've noticed Salumi products in some top-flight delis and specialty food shops around the country. But use any really good salami you can find. I've also used mainstream salami available at the grocery store with decent results as well.

Add the bread flour and stir to make a wet dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours and up to 15 hours. The next day the starter should be soupy with a bubbly surface.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the garlic in foil and bake for about 30 minutes until fragrant. Let cool, then slip garlic cloves out of their skins and roughly chop.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add all of the starter and use a dough whisk or spatula to break it up into the water. It doesn't have to completely dissolve into the water. Add the bread flour, salt, sugar, and chopped garlic. Knead the dough with the mixer on medium speed for about 12-15 minutes. At first the dough will be very wet, but eventually it will thicken somewhat and clear the sides of the bowl, and turn glossy and smooth. When you turn off the mixer, it will pool at the bottom of the bowl, and that's okay.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until tripled, about 1 1/2 hours.With generously floured hands, scoop the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface. Divide the dough in two. Working very gently, and re-flouring your hands as necessary, shape dough into oblong loaves and place each on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.

Stir together and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.In a small bowl, stir together remaining brown sugar and milk, mixing until sugar is dissolved.Reserve one cup of the flour and set aside. Add remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and milk mixture to yeast mixture. Mix on low with dough hook (or by hand with wooden spoon). Add reserved flour as needed to make a soft dough.Gently knead dough into a smooth ball on a floured surface, Then place in clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.Preheat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Cut the dough into 4 separate pieces, then divide those pieces in half. Roll out each piece to desired length and flatten with rolling pin. Place 1-2 slices of ham and either thin sliced or shredded cheese on each rolled out piece of dough. Roll up the dough and seal the edges using warm water. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot.

Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. Tip: Rub a drop of the warm sugar mixture between your fingertips to make sure it feels smooth, with no trace of sugar granules. If the mixture feels sandy, continue warming and stirring until the mixture is smooth.When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals from the pan sides.Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 330 degrees F, a light caramel stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches 320 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 330 degrees. In addition, remove the pan from the heat just before the syrup reaches 330 degrees to prevent it from going over 330 degrees. F.Let the hot mixture sit about 30 seconds to let the bubbling subside. Working carefully to prevent splattering, add the peanuts and stir quickly to thoroughly mix. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it.Immediately pour the praline onto the prepared baking pan. Using a heavy spatula (a spatula that is not too flexible) quickly spread the praline over the pan about  inch thick. Tip: You must work quickly because it takes less than a minute for the praline to start cooling, once cooled it will be difficult to spread.When the praline is completely cooled, break into small 2 or 3 inch pieces. Finely grind about three-fourths of the praline pieces in a food processor or small food grinder to make about 1 cups of ground praline. You will use 1 cup of the ground praline in the truffles and about  cup of the ground praline for the garnish. The remainder of the praline pieces can be eaten and enjoyed as is.In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, butter, and peanut butter; use an electric hand mixer or wooden spoon and beat together until mixture is smooth. Add powdered sugar, melted and cooled white chocolate, and 1 cup of the finely ground Salted Peanut Praline; mix until thoroughly combined. Cover truffle mixture and refrigerate until well chilled, 1 to 2 hours.Shape chilled truffle mixture into small balls, using about 2 teaspoons of mixture for each ball. Tip: A small ice cream scoop is ideal for making uniform-sized candies. Keep refrigerated until ready to dip in the chocolate coating.Line a large baking pan with waxed paper or parchment paper.In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt milk chocolate. Stir in the shortening. Set aside to cool. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Turn the heat off and place a glass bowl, stainless steel bowl, or ceramic bowl on top of the hot water; the upper pan should not touch the water.Place the cooled bowl of chocolate over a pan of hot water to keep the chocolate a liquid consistency for dipping.Place one truffle at a time in the chocolate, gently turn it over with a fork or candy dipping fork. Tap the fork on the rim of the bowl to allow excess chocolate to drip back into the pan, and then draw the underside of the fork over the rim of the pan to remove any drips of chocolate. Gently place the chocolate coated truffles on the prepared baking pan, pushing the truffle off the fork with another fork. Garnish by sprinkling a small amount of finely ground Salted Peanut Praline on top of each truffle. Let truffles sit until the chocolate is dry and firm. Tip: refrigerate chocolate coated truffles about 30 minutes for the chocolate to become firm. However, if the chocolate has been tempered the balls do not need to be refrigerated as the chocolate should set quickly.Store in an airtight container so they wont dry out. Candies dipped with tempered chocolate can generally be stored in a cool place or at room temperature. Candies dipped with melted (untempered chocolate) should generally be stored in the refrigerator.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/peanut-butter-truffles-672148", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 360, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Kraft Recipes", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/spinach-chorizo-lasagna-roll-ups-544748.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 544748, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spinach-Chorizo Lasagna Roll-Ups", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Kraft Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 egg, beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 pkg.

or grill pan on medium high.Mix together the hot sauce, brown sugar, paprika and cayenne in a small bowl. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the mixture to a large bowl and whisk in the mayonnaise; set aside the rest of the sauce. Add the chives, celery and onions to the bowl with the mayonnaise and toss well.Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper. Brush the grill grate lightly with oil. Lay the salmon on the grill, skin-side up, and cook until distinct grill marks appear and the salmon releases easily from the grate, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and brush the fish with some of the reserved sauce. Continue to cook the fish, brushing the pieces periodically with the sauce, until the salmon fillets are glazed and just cooked through, 13 to 15 minutes more.Transfer the fillets to individual plates and serve with the celery slaw.
