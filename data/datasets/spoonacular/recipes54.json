For the topping: Heat the heavy cream, maple syrup, cream cheese, vanilla and kosher salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking frequently to break up and smooth out the cream cheese, until the mixture just begins to bubble, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover and keep warm.For the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder and fine salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, butter, eggs and vanilla together in a medium bowl. Add the milk mixture and sprinkles to the flour mixture, and fold until just incorporated (it's okay if there are some lumps).Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat, add about 1/2 tablespoon butter and let melt. Pour 1/4-cupfuls of batter onto the hot skillet, and cook until the pancakes are lightly golden on the bottom and bubbly on the top, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes, and cook until lightly golden on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the pancakes to serving plates, stacking them on top of each other if desired, and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining batter.Pour the topping over the stacks, and top with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkles. Add a birthday candle if you like, and serve the remaining topping on the side.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Add the shrimp and toss; refrigerate until ready to fry. Whisk the chili sauce, the remaining 2 tablespoons each rice wine and soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1 cup water in a bowl; set aside.Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the broccolini; stir-fry until charred in spots, 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and stir-fry until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes; transfer to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium; add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the scallions, garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir-fry until tender, 2 minutes. Add the chili sauce mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 1 minute. Cover and set aside.Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365 degrees F. Working in batches, toss the shrimp in cornstarch to coat, then fry until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.Return the wok to medium heat and reheat the sauce if needed. Add the broccolini and shrimp and cook, tossing, until warmed through, 2 minutes. (Add up to 1/2 cup water if the sauce is too thick.)

Cut up thinner shrimp shells with a chef's knife. Don't crush or cut too small. You can even skip this step if you want, if you are already dealing with broken up shell pieces (like cracked crab). Place in a large roasting pan and roast at 400\u00b0F for 10 minutes (this step you can skip, but it greatly enhances the flavor).Put the shells in a large stock pot and add enough water to cover the shells with an inch of water. 2 Put the stove temperature on medium high and slowly heat the shells in the water. As soon as you see that little bubbles are starting to come up to the surface, reduce the heat to medium. Do not let it boil. You want to maintain the temperature at just below a simmer, where the bubbles just occasionally come up to the surface. Do not stir the shells. Stirring will muddy up the stock. As the bubbles come up to the surface a film of foam will develop on the surface. Use a large slotted spoon to skim away this foam. Let the shells cook like this for about an hour; skim the foam every few minutes. The foam comes from shells releasing impurities as their temperature increases.3 Put the thyme, bay leaves, and parsley in cheese cloth. Secure with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.4 Once the stock has stopped releasing foam, you can add the wine, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, herb bouquet garni, and peppercorns. Bring to a low simmer and reduce heat so that the stock continues to simmer, but not boil, for 30 minutes. If more foam comes to the surface, skim it off. Add salt and remove from heat. 5 Dampen a few layers of cheesecloth and place over a large, fine mesh strainer, over a large pot or bowl. Pour the stock into the strainer. Discard the solids. Either use the stock right away, or cool for future use. If you aren't going to use in a couple of days, freeze (remember to leave some head room at the top of your freezer container for the liquid to expand as it freezes.)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-to-make-shellfish-stock-245504", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Tickling Palates", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Rava-Ladoos-564652.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 564652, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Rava Ladoos", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Tickling Palates", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Cardamom \u2013 2", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cardamom", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cardamom.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2006, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Cashew nuts \u2013 10", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "cashew nuts", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cashews.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 10.0, "id": 12087, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Ghee \u2013 5 tbsp", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "ghee", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ghee.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 93632, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "Milk \u2013 1/4 cup (approx.,)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["(approx.,)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Sugar \u2013 1 cup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Rava / Sooji (Cream of Wheat) \u2013 1 cup", "aisle": "?", "name": "rava / sooji", "metaInformation": ["(Cream of Wheat)"], "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.ticklingpalates.com/2012/11/rava-ladoos.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 330, "instructions": "Heat a pan and dry roast rava/suji over low flame for 3-4 mins stirring continuously until the raw smell disappears.

Add olive oil, butter, onions and carrots and saute 5 minutes. Add 4 cups chicken stock, curry and cayenne, and about 1 teaspoon salt to the pot. Bring to a boil, cover and cook until carrots are very tender, about 15 minutes. Place pot on a trivet next to food processor. Process soup in 2 or 3 small batches until soup is smooth and carrots are fully pureed. Transfer processed soup into a large bowl as you work to make room for more soup in the food processor. Return completed soup to the soup pot and place back over low heat. If the soup is too thick, add remaining stock, up to 2 cups, to achieve desired consistency. Adjust seasonings. Place sour cream in a plastic condiment squeeze bottle or into a medium food storage bag. Cut a very small hole in the corner of the bag with scissors. Ladle soup into bowls and squirt a swirl of sour cream around the bowl from the center out to the rim. Drag a toothpick from the center of the bowls out to the edges, forming a spider web design on soup. Pile a few pieces of cut chives at the center of each bowl to resemble green spiders in their webs! Cool!

Turn carefully with a metal spatula and cook for 2 minutes on the other side. While the second side cooks, add 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the pan. Carefully put the fish filets on the ovenproof plates and pour the sauce over them. Keep the cooked fillets warm in the oven while you repeat the process with the remaining 2 fillets. When they're done, add the cooked fillets to the plates in the oven. Sprinkle with the parsley, salt, and pepper and serve immediately.                                                    2008, Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics, All Rights Reserved

Let cool.While the patty pan squash is roasting, combine the herbs, anchovies, cayenne pepper, lemon peel, verjuice, black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil in the bowl of a mini-chopper, and pulse until more or less smooth. (Alternatively, you can chop the herbs and anchovies finely by hand, and combine the dressing in the salad bowl.)Toss the cooled and drained chickpeas with the herb dressing in a salad bowl, and let rest in the refrigerator. When the patty pan squash is cooled, arrange the segments on each plate, and top with the dressed chickpeas.

until smooth.In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.With an electric mixer (or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy.Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs one at a time, beating for about 30 seconds after each addition.Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract and beat to combine.With the mixer on low, add the 1/3 of the chocolate mixture followed by 1/2 the flour mixture, alternating between the 2 mixtures and starting and ending with the chocolate. Do not over mix.Divide the batter between the 3 pans and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Cool on wire racks for about 15 minutes.Run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto to wire racks to cool completely.Combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt in a bowl (I used the bowl of my stand mixer).Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. The bowl should not touch the water, nor should the water be at a rolling boil. It's the steam that's going to heat the egg whites, since you don't want scrambled eggs.Heat the egg white mixture until it reaches 160 degrees fahrenheit, whisking frequently so as not to get scrambled eggs.Remove the bowl from the heat, and whip the egg whites on medium high using the whisk attachment of your stand mixer.Whip the egg whites until they become fluffy and double in volume. The bowl should be cool to the touch (this will usually take several minutes).Turn the mixer down to medium low, and add the butter in one chunk at a time, until it has all been incorporated.If the mixture looks curdled at this point, this is normal.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter. Pour into a pie pan and press in firmly with your hands, going all the way up the sides. Using a measuring cup press the bottom in very firmly. Bake for 15-25 minutes until golden brown. Cool completely.Make the marshmallow fluff.  In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup over medium heat. Stir frequently until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is clear. Once this happens, attach a candy thermometer, raise the heat to medium-high, and stop stirring. Allow the mixture to come to 240 degrees F on the candy thermometer.In the meantime, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium-high until frothy. Add the cream of tartar. Continue beating on medium-high until the egg whites form stiff peaks.When the egg whites have formed stiff peaks and the sugar mixture has reached 240, remove the syrup from the heat and turn the mixer to medium-low. Slowly and immediately begin drizzling the syrup into the egg whites, trying not to get it on the sides of the bowl. If the whites are done whipping before the syrup is done, turn them off until the syrup reaches 235, then turn them back on to make sure they are fluffy. If the syrup is done before the whites, turn the heat down or remove it from the heat for a minute or so.Once the syrup is drizzled into the whites, turn the mixer back up to medium-high and beat for about 7 minutes, until the bottom of the bowl is cool and the marshmallow is thick, glossy, and voluminous. Add the vanilla bean paste and mix about 1 minute more. Marshmallow may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. I recommend doing this as it makes assembling the pie easier.Make the pastry cream.  In a medium bowl, whisk together \u00bd cup milk and cornstarch.  Place the remaining milk and the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Cook until the mixture just starts to bubble.Whisk the eggs and egg yolks into the milk and cornstarch mixture until well combined.  Slowly add about 1/3 of the hot milk mixture to the egg mixture while whisking.  Then pour the egg mixture into the remaining hot milk in the saucepan and place over medium low heat.  It is important to keep the heat low so the mixture does not curdle.  Whisk constantly until the mixture starts to thicken.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter and vanilla bean paste until fully combined.Assemble the pie.  Preheat the broiler.  Pour pastry cream immediately into the baked and cooled crust.  Top immediately with the marshmallow fluff.  Make peaks in the marshmallow using the back of a spoon or a knife.  Place under the broiler for 1-2 minutes until the marshmallow is golden brown.  Do not walk away during this process, as it will burn quickly.Allow the pie to chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours before serving.

About halfway through the mixing, scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.After 5 minutes, with the mixer still running, add the whole egg and mix until fully incorporated.Turn the mixer to low and add in half the starch/flour mixture. After it has incorporated, add one egg white. Repeat with the remaining flour and egg white. Continue mixing until homogenous; shut off the mixer.Use a rubber spatula to transfer the batter to a piping bag, fitted with a 1/2\" plain tip.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pipe and bake the cookies:Pipe a smidgen of cookie dough onto all four corners of both sheets of parchment. Then flip the parchment over so the doughy corners are directly touching the cookie sheet. Use your fingers to smooth the parchment down. Now the parchment is \"glued\" to the cookie sheet and won't slide around while you pipe.Aim to pipe the cookies 30 to a tray, in five rows of six. Pipe the cookies a little more than a half inch wide and 2\" long. To pipe, hold the pastry bag so that the tip is perpendicular to the tray and only about an 1/8\" from the surface. Really, you are aiming to smear the dough out rather than pipe it out. Squeeze the bag to begin piping and as soon as the dough has hit the surface of the tray, immediately drag the tip two inches to the right (left if you are left handed). Stop piping and bring the tip back slightly toward the center of the cookie. Lift the tip straight up. This will give each cookie an oval shape with a roughly barbell like swelling at each end, and a peak of dough at one end. Of course, you can pipe the cookies into any shape you like. Just take care that they are all roughly the same size so they will sandwich together nicely. If you're a perfectionist and unhappy with your piping job, you can use a rubber spatula to scrape the dough back up and into the bag. Give yourself a fresh sheet of parchment and start again.Bake for 25 minutes, rotating the trays halfway through, or until the cookies have just taken on the slightest golden color around the edges but are otherwise quite anemic. If you notice the cookies beginning to brown early, your oven may be running a little hot and your cookies will finish sooner.Remove the cookies from the oven and set aside, still on the cookie sheets, until thoroughly cooled.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Make the ganache:In a very small pot, bring the cream to a simmer. Shut off the heat and add the chocolate, vanilla (or other flavor) and salt. Use a whisk to stir gently, until the chocolate melts. Whisk more vigorously to bring the ganache together. If the mixture seems slightly curdled or lumpy, drizzle in a little extra cream, one Tablespoonful at a time. Whisk all the while, until the ganache is smooth.Use a spatula to transfer the ganache to a piping bag fit with a 1/4\" plain tip.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Filling and finishing the cookies:Begin matching up the cookies into pairs that fit, bottom to bottom, together nicely. Don't worry if they don't match up closely, you just want to make sure you pair the biggest cookie and the smallest cookies together so there's no huge discrepancy between pairs.Arrange half of the cookies bottoms up, with their mate sitting right beside, bottoms down.Pipe a 1\" strip of ganache down the center of each bottoms-up cookie (stopping a little shy of each end). Top each ganache covered cookie with its mate, using your fingers to gently press the cookies together and to push the ganache out until its flush with the edges.Repeat until all cookies have been sandwiched. Place the cookies in the fridge and chill for 10 minutes. Once the cookies have chilled, transfer them to an airtight container, placing a sheet of parchment paper between layers.Store at room temperature for one week, or two weeks refrigerated.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-milanos-205761", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Novice Chef Blog", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Lauras-AppleJack-Sangria-583952.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 583952, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Laura's AppleJack Sangria", "creditText": "The Novice Chef Blog", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 large apple, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apple", "metaInformation": ["large", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9003, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2.5 cups AppleJack Brandy", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "brandy", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/calvados.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 10114037, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "a handful of grapes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "grapes", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-grapes.jpg", "unitLong": "handful", "unitShort": "handful", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9132, "unit": "handful"}, {"originalString": "1 Lemon, juiced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": ["juiced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 Oranges (1 orange juiced, 1 orange sliced)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "oranges", "metaInformation": ["juiced", "sliced", "(1 orange , 1 orange )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9200, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 cups Real Sangria", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "real cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1041009, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 79.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.thenovicechefblog.com/2011/08/red-red-wine-stay-close-to-me/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 36, "aggregateLikes": 1894, "instructions": "In a large pitcher combine AppleJack Brandy and Real Sangria, juice of 1 orange, and juice of lemon.
