Squeeze into small clumps on a baking sheet and refrigerate until the streusel is chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.For the muffins: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the top of the muffin tray to keep the muffins from sticking. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with your favorite liners.Combine the all-purpose flour, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, baking powder, ginger, salt, allspice, baking soda and clove in a large bowl.Whisk together the pumpkin puree, buttermilk, eggs and butter in a separate small bowl.Fold the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined (don't fret if the batter has lumps this means your batter isn't over-mixed).Fill each muffin liner 3/4 of the way full. Evenly divide the streusel among the muffins, mounding in the center.Bake until the topping is golden and crunchy and a toothpick inserted in the muffins comes out clean, rotating the trays about halfway through, 25 to 28 minutes. Let rest in the hot muffin pan 3 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved                                                            To save some time, toast your pecans and pepitas together on the same baking sheet. The streusel top is crunchy and delicious but be sure not to snub the stump!Use your leftover pumpkin puree to make Pumpkin Frosting for another type of muffin or quick bread: Beat together 1 cup pumpkin puree, 8 ounces soft cream cheese, 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 teaspoon orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and a pinch each allspice and salt until smooth. This will be enough to frost about 12 cupcakes or muffins.

                   For poinsettia dough, divide corn syrup between two bowls. Stir red candy coating into one bowl and green into the other just until blended. Spread each mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper to 1/2-in. thickness (about 4-in. square). Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature for 2-3 hours or until dry to the touch. Remove each mixture from waxed paper and gather into a ball. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap; let stand overnight.                                                                                           Make leaf and petal patterns and trace onto waxed paper and cut out, or use leaf-shaped cookie cutters. Knead a portion of green dough until pliable but not soft. Roll between waxed paper to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut out four large and four small leaves; with a toothpick, score veins. Arrange in two circles on waxed paper with center points touching.                                                                                            Knead and roll out a portion of red dough as above. For each poinsettia, cut out five to seven large flower petals. Shape petals as shown in photo; place in between green leaves, matching centers. Cut out 10 to 14 smaller flower petals from red dough (use additional dough if needed). Shape as shown; arrange between large red petals.                                                                                           For flower stamens, form tiny balls of green dough. Place several in center of each flower, covering all petal centers. Melt white chips; stir in yellow food coloring. Transfer to a resealable heavy-duty plastic bag; cut a small hole in corner of bag. Pipe onto green centers. Store poinsettias in an airtight container at room temperature.                                                                                           For cake, let egg whites stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, sift flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, beat egg yolks until slightly thickened. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, beating until thick and lemon-colored. Beat in vanilla. Add sifted ingredients; mix well.                                                                                           In another bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold a fourth of egg whites into batter; fold in remaining whites.                                                                                           Line a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with waxed paper and grease the paper. Spread batter evenly into pan. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 12-15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Gently peel off waxed paper. Roll up cake in the towel jelly-roll style, starting with a short side. Cool completely on a wire rack.                                                                                           For filling, in a large bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Beat in 2 cups confectioners' sugar, cocoa, 3 tablespoons milk and vanilla. Add remaining confectioners' sugar and enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Unroll cake; spread filling evenly to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up again. Place on a wire rack over a baking sheet; cover and set aside.                                                                                           Place chocolate chips in a small bowl. In a heavy saucepan, bring cream to a boil over low heat. Pour over chips; whisk gently until smooth. Chill for 35-45 minutes or until ganache begins to thicken, stirring occasionally.                                                                                            Pour half of the ganache over cake, allowing excess to drip off. Chill cake and remaining ganache, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until remaining ganache has cooled and a thermometer reads about 62\u00b0. Pour ganache slowly in a thin stream over cake; chill until set.                                                                                            If piping is desired, transfer ganache that dripped from cake into a bowl; chill for 45 minutes. Whisk until thickened, about 1 minute. Place cake on a serving platter. Place thickened ganache in a pastry bag with a #21 star tip; pipe around bottom of cake. Position poinsettias on top of cake; gently press into ganache. Store in the refrigerator.                                        Yield: 10 servings.

Remove chorizo with a slotted spoon and drain on some paper towels.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Season the thighs and breasts with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and brown on both sides, about ten minutes total. Remove the chicken pieces and set aside.                                                                                                                              3                                                                            Remove all but two tablespoons of fat in the skillet. Add the bell peppers, onions, garlic, and thyme. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, about five minutes. Add the sherry, tomatoes, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Stir well to dislodge any browned bits and simmer for one minute.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Nestle the thighs in the skillet (you'll add the breasts later) and add the cooked chorizo. Cover the skillet and place in the oven. Cook for 15 minutes, and then remove the skillet, flip the thighs, and add the breast pieces. Cover again and return to the oven. Cook until the chicken pieces are completely cooked, ten to fifteen minutes. If needed, season with more salt and pepper. Garnish with basil.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Stir together the butter, olive oil, chives and some salt and pepper in a small bowl.Place a potato between the handles of 2 wooden spoons or 2 chopsticks. Slice the potato into thin slices, leaving 1/4 inch at the bottom unsliced; the spoon handles will prevent you from slicing the potato all the way through. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.Put the potatoes on a baking sheet and brush on the butter mixture, making sure to get in between all the slices. Bake until tender and crisp, 55 to 60 minutes.

Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Whisk the egg yolk with 1/4 cup ice water; add 2 tablespoons to the food processor and pulse a couple of times. Add the remaining egg mixture and pulse a few more times until the dough just comes together but is still crumbly. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk the eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla and butter extracts, lemon juice, salt, pecans and toffee bits in a large bowl until combined. Pour the filling into the chilled crust. Transfer the pie to the hot baking sheet and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until the crust is deep golden and the filling is set around the edge but still jiggly in the center, 55 minutes to 1 hour. (Tent the crust with foil if it browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool completely.

Add the onion and garlic and cover. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring once or twice to make sure the garlic and onions aren't sticking (adjust the heat if they are). Cook until the onions are soft but not browned. Stir in the flour and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. It's ok if the flour clumps around the onions, just keep stirring to let the flour get golden and toasty.Gradually add the broth, whisking quickly and constantly to smooth out any lumps. Add all the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Fold in the cooled oatmeal and stir until well combined. Gently fold in the remaining flour and then the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.5. Bake the cake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool on a wire rack until completely cooled. 6.

Add the extracts if using, and beat until blended.In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients. Slowly add to the butter mixture while the mixer is on low speed. Once the flour has been worked in, slowly increase the speed to medium. Beat on medium speed for 5-6 minutes. This is crucial, as it adds the lightness to the dough, giving you a light, airy cookie.Scoop 3/4-inch balls of dough onto the cookie sheet, keeping 2-inches between cookies.

Rub with oil and pepper. Bake, uncovered, at 325\u00b0 for 2-3/4 to 3-1/4 hours or until a thermometer reads 180\u00b0. (Cover loosely with foil if turkey browns too quickly.)

Combine the bay leaves, thyme, and salt in a spice grinder and process until powdery.2. Place the butter in a mixing bowl. Add the powdered mixture and, using a hand\u00adheld electric mixer, blend well. Scrape the butter mixture onto the center of a sheet of plastic wrap. Pull the wrap up and over the soft butter and, using your hands, form the butter into a roll about 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 week or wrap in freezer wrap, label, date, and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, unwrap the flavored butter and, using a sharp knife, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices, allowing one slice per steak.Make the steak3. Preheat the grill.4. Wipe any excess moisture from the steaks with a paper towel. Season the top side with salt and pepper.5. Place the steaks on the hot grill, seasoned side down. Grill for 3 minutes. Season the top side with salt and pepper and, using tongs, turn the steaks and grill for 3 minutes.6. Remove the steaks from the grill and, using a pastry brush, lightly coat both sides of each steak with olive oil. Return the steaks to the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until the exterior is nicely charred and the interior has reached the desired degree of doneness on an instant-read thermometer. (Rare steak will have an internal temperature of 120\u00b0 to 125\u00b0F (48\u00b0 to 52\u00b0C); medium-rare to medium should read 130\u00b0 to 150\u00b0F (54\u00b0 to 65\u00b0C). This should take somewhere near 20 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the meat and the precise heat. Above 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C), a steak is considered well-done, which is not a desirable temperature for a really good steak. A steak should sit for 5 minutes or so before cutting, so remember that the meat will continue to rise a little in temperature as it rests.)7. Remove the steaks from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 \u00b0F (190\u00b0C).2. In a large roasting pan, arrange the chicken legs skin-side down, but not cramped together. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken well, leaving the chicken skin-side up. (Don\u2019t skimp on the salt: you should be able to see it clearly on the meat but it shouldn\u2019t look like a heavy snowfall.)3. Smash the garlic cloves well and tuck one beneath each leg. Sprinkle the rosemary around the pan and again, don\u2019t skimp. Drizzle some olive oil over all, squeeze fresh juice from the quartered lemons over all, and tuck the lemon pieces in among the chicken pieces. If the chicken legs are small, add a small slosh of water or wine (white or red) to the pan to maintain a little moisture until the legs begin to give up their own juices.4. Place the pan in the oven and roast the legs for 50 to 60 minutes, checking the pan after 25 or 30 minutes. (If the meat is very lean you may need to add some more liquid to the pan so that the meat doesn\u2019t get dry.) The chicken skin should be well browned and crispy; the leg joint should be loose. Test by grabbing one end of a drumstick with tongs and piercing the meat with a sharp knife: the juices should be clear, and when you cut into the meat it should fall off the bone.Usually this chicken won\u2019t require a sauce, but if your chicken is lean, you can deglaze the pan with a little wine or water, swirl in a little butter, and pour the reduced sauce over the meat. Let the legs rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving with your preferred vegetable contorno or a salad of fresh greens.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic, honey and red chile flakes in a food processor and process. While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve.For the tapenade: Combine the olives, anchovies and garlic in a food processor and process. While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce.For the mashed potatoes: Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes.In a separate saucepan heat up the milk.Drain the potatoes well to remove any excess water. Using a ricer, mash the potatoes into a mixing bowl while they are hot. Add the butter, mascarpone and a splash of the hot milk and fold into the potatoes until incorporated. Add just enough milk to achieve a velvety consistency. Season with salt and pepper. To keep warm until serving, place the bowl over a pot of simmering water.For the bison: Preheat the broiler on high.Place a large saute pan on high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle both sides of the bison tenderloins well with salt and pepper and place on the smoking-hot pan to sear. Once a crust has formed on the bottom, remove the meat from the pan and slice it. Return the slices to the pan. Spread the slabs of butter on top of the meat. Season with a little more salt and pepper and place under the broiler until the butter is melted.Put the arugula in a bowl, drizzle with extra-virgin oil and toss together. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble: Barely fold 2 tablespoons of the tapenade into the potatoes. Place several pieces of the bison on each plate and top with a dollop of the piquillo pepper pesto. Spoon some of the pan butter sauce over the bison and garnish with some arugula.

"Cook the pasta according to package instructions (Note: I tend to cook gluten-free pasta for 2 minutes less than the package calls for because I like my pasta al dente). Once cooked, drain the pasta and place it back in the pot. Toss in 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Set aside until ready to use.While pasta is cooking, heat the butter, oil, garlic and lemon juice in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes, or until garlic is very fragrant. Add the yellow squash, zucchini, green onion, lemon zest and Italian seasoning. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, just until veggies begin to soften. Move the vegetables over to one side of the skillet and add the sliced raw chicken. Allow chicken to brown for 2 to 3 minutes before stirring everything together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies and chicken are cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.

   One hour before cooking, remove neck from refrigerator. Pour 2 cup boiling water over the mushrooms in a small bow, and leave them to soak.  Preheat the oven to 300 F.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Pat the neck dry and season with salt and pepper.  In a dutch oven or large flameproof casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium high heat.  Brown the neck on all sides, including the bone.  Transfer the meat to a plate and discard any fat from the pot.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Add the bacon or pancetta and the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot and cook over low heat for 2 minutes.  Increase the heat, add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot frequently.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Lift the mushrooms from the soaking liquid and add them to the pot, along with garlic and herbs.  Strain the mushroom liquid through a fine sieve, discarding any sand or grid, and the liquid to the pot, with the cinnamon stick and lemon zest. Bring to a boil, deglazing the pot by scraping the browned bits from the bottom.                                                                                                                              5                                                                            Place the neck int the pot.  Pour in any meat juices, add the wine, and bring to a boil. Cover with a damp piece of parchment paper and then the lid, and braise in the oven for 3 to 3.5 hours.  The meat should be very tender and lift easily from the bone.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Transfer the neck to a platter and cover with saran wrap to prevent drying out.  Discard the herbs, cinnamon stick, and zest and let the sauce cool off slightly, then puree it with an immersion blender or food processor.  Bring the sauce to a boil, skim off the foam, and boil hard for 10 to 12 minutes to reduce it to 4 cups.  Cool the meat and sauce separately, then refrigerate overnight.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            The next day, remove any fat from the sauce.  Preheat the oven to 300 F. Place the neck back into the pot with the sauce and place into the oven.  Depending on you like to serve your meat, either serve in the pot, letting your guest take the neck meat off the bone, or debone prior to bring the neck to the table.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Pulse once or twice to combine. Add the diced butter and pulse until you end up with small pieces of butter, similar to the size of rice. You may also do this in a bowl, using your hands to break the butter into pea size pieces.In a small bowl, whisk together the one egg yolk and 3 tablespoons ice cold water. Add it to the dough and pulse until the dough comes together. If needed add 1-2 tablespoons more ice water. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, knead a couple of times and then form the dough into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Toss the delicata squash (you can also roast the seeds for topping!) with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet with sides and roast for 25-30 minutes or until the flesh is soft and the edges golden.Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on a paper towel lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease and return the pan to the stove.Add the butter and once hot, add the mushrooms + a good pinch of salt + pepper. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the balsamic and thyme, continue cooking another 3-5 minutes or until the mushrooms are caramelized. Remove from the heat and stir the bacon into the mushroom. Set aside to cool.Now grab your dough from the fridge. Flour your work surface and roll the dough to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leaving a 3-inch border around the edges, spread the dough with the fig preserves, fontina cheese and then scatter on the mushroom/bacon mix and add a few slices of roasted squash, leaving a few out of the mix for topping later. Top with the figs. Fold the edge of the dough over the filling. Brush the crust with the beaten egg and then sprinkle the parmesan cheese on the edges of the dough. Place the galette in the fridge for 15 minutes or until ready to bake.Bake the galette at 375 degrees F. for 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden. Allow to cool 5 minutes and then slice and serve topped with the roasted squash (warm the squash back up in the oven for 5 minutes first).
