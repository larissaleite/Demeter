Spoon 2 tablespoons bacon drippings into a skillet and reserve the rest of the drippings for another use. Once the bacon has cooled, coarsely chop it. 3. Heat the bacon drippings in the skillet over medium heat. Add the jalape\u00f1o and saut\u00e9 until softened, about 5 minutes. 4. Using a stand mixer or a bowl and a spatula, mix together 1 cup chopped bacon, the saut\u00e9ed jalape\u00f1o, the cream cheese, Cheddar, and the scallions until combined.
