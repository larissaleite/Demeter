Let sit them for 5 minutes and then repeat the dredging process to make sure you get a perfect coating of flour.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 350\u00b0F over high heat  (measured on a deep-frying thermometer). once the temperature is reached, reduce the heat to medium-high to maintain it.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Working in batches, add the chicken to the oil and fry until the chicken is golden, crispy, and cooked through, about 12 minutes for white meat and 15 to 17 minutes for dark. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and place on a cooling rack. Season generously with coarse sea salt.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            When the chicken has finished cooking, fry the curry leaves in the cooking oil until crispy, about 10 seconds, then transfer them with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Place the chicken on a large plate and crumble some of the fried curry leaves over it.

"Roasting the beets  Preheat the oven to 350F. Wash and lightly scrub the beets. Pat them dry and place on a sheet of foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Wrap the foil tightly to form a packet, poking a few holes to allow steam to escape and place on a baking sheet. Roast for 1 hour, or until the beets are tender. Remove from the oven, and while still warm, carefully peel off and discard the skins. Place the beets in a food processor and add a little of the roasting liquid from the packet. Pulse 10 to 12 times, until the beets are finely chopped but still have some texture. Season with a drizzle of the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and with salt and pepper. Set aside.  Making the horseradish aioli  In a blender, combine the egg white, horseradish and lemon juice. Blend until creamy. Then, with the blender running, slowly drizzle in the grapeseed oil until the mixture emulsifies. Season with salt. Refrigerate until ready to use. Make the tempura batter. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, and salt. Make a well in the center and gradually pour in the club soda, whisking constantly and working your way from the center out to slowly incorporate the dry ingredients and form a smooth batter.  Fry the onion petals  Heat 3 to 4 inches of canola oil to 375F in a large pot. Peel the onions and cut each into 6 wedges. Separate the layers and discard the smaller inner layers. Working in small batches, dredge the petals in flour and then lightly coat in the tempura batter. Fry until crisp and golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels, and season with salt. To assemble, place the onion petals on a large platter cupped side up. Serve with spoonfuls of the beet tartare and dot with the horseradish aioli. Garnish with the chopped chives, chervil leaves and salmon roe. Season with flaky sea salt.

Add the flour a little at a time to form a soft dough. Add all of the flour, and continue to beat until elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 50 minutes.  Can be placed in the refrigerator overnight instead.                            Beat down the dough, and divide into two pieces.  Place each in a buttered 9 inch square pan.  Brush the top of each with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.  Cover and let rise until doubled.                            For the glaze, place the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons butter, cream, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Boil for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice and almonds.  Let cool slightly.  Drizzle the warm glaze, not hot, over each of the cakes.                            Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until the nuts are golden.  Cool on a rack.                            Split the cakes lengthwise using a serrated knife, and fill with the pastry cream.

Whisk for 2-5 minutes or until the pudding is smooth and slightly thickened.  Set the mixture aside-the pudding will thicken more as it sits.Measure the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar into a small bowl. Remove 1 teaspoon of it and add it, along with the yeast, to the warm water. Stir, then set the mixture aside to allow the yeast to dissolve and the mixture to get foamy, about 3-5 minutes.In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, the remaining granulated sugar and salt until smooth.  Beat in the eggs, vanilla, butter extract, cream cheese emulsion, almond extract, lemon zest, yeast and 2 cups of the flour.  Beat on medium speed of an electric mixer for 2 minutes.Add the pudding and 1 cup of flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in just enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. It will still be somewhat sticky.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead, using some of the remaining flour, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Knead in the dried cherries until they are evenly dispersed in the dough.Place the dough in a large greased bowl. Turn the dough to grease the top. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-1 1/2 hours.While the dough is rising, make the filling. Combine the graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a medium bowl.  Stir in the melted butter and almonds until well mixed. Set the filling aside.Spray 3-4 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.Punch the dough down and divide it half. I weigh the dough on my digital scale to make sure each half is the same size.On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of the dough into an 18x14-inch rectangle. Spritz the dough with water. Spread half of the filling evenly over the dough, then press the mixture into the dough lightly to help adhere it to the surface.  Fold the dough in half to make an 18x7-inch rectangle. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into (12) 1 1/2\" strips. Twist each strip 2-3 times and place them on the prepared pans.Scoop up any of the filling mixture that remains on the work surface and sprinkle it over the tops of the each twist.Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.Lightly cover each pan of twists and let them rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes.When the twists have almost doubled in size, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Uncover the rolls and bake @ 350 degrees for 13-15 minutes or until they are light golden brown and cooked through.Remove from the pans and place on wire racks to cool completely. Again, if any of the crumb mixture remains on the baking pans, scrape it up and sprinkle it over the tops of each twist.For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, cheese cake oil and almond extract in a small bowl.  Stir in 2 tablespoons of milk, then stir in additional milk until the mixture is smooth and reaches the desired drizzling consistency.Drizzle the glaze over each roll.

Coat eight 10-ounce ramekins or a 2 1/2-quart souffl dish (or similar-size baking dish) with cooking spray. Sprinkle with enough of the 3 tablespoons sugar to generously coat the inside, tilting to evenly distribute; tap out excess. Place ramekins on a baking sheet.Combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, coconut and coconut extract in a bowl.Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Melt butter and oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking, for 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the hot milk and cook over medium-low heat, whisking, until the mixture is the consistency of thick batter, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, one at a time, until incorporated. Whisk in the coconut mixture.Clean and dry a large mixing bowl and beaters, making sure there are no traces of oil. (Any fat in your egg whites may prevent your souffl from rising properly.) Beat egg whites in the bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy. Add salt; gradually increase speed to high and beat until shiny and stiff, but not dry. Do not overbeat: stop when the egg whites hold their shape in the bowl and on the beater but dont look overly dry or lumpy.Using a rubber spatula, stir one-third of the whites into the egg-yolk mixture to lighten it. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites just until evenly distributed. Its OK if a few white streaks remain.

Lightly butter a Swiss roll tin and line the base with non-stick baking parchment. Put the whole eggs, egg yolks and caster sugar in a bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk for 8-10 mins until light and fluffy. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl over a pan of almost simmering water, stirring occasionally.When the whisked egg mixture is light and fluffy, gently fold in the flour with a large metal spoon or the whisk blades, taking care not to lose too much volume. Beat a small amount of the egg mixture into the melted chocolate, then gently fold the chocolate into the remaining egg mixture. Pour into the prepared tin, then tilt the tin from side to side until even and the corners are filled. Bake for 10 mins until firm, then leave to cool completely.Line a 1-litre freezer-proof pudding basin with cling film. Cut a small circle of sponge cake to fit the base then cut triangular pieces to line the sides. Fill any gaps with trimmings and save the remaining sponge for later. Place the bowl in the freezer to firm up the sponge.Make the ice cream: slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways and remove the seeds. Put the milk, vanilla seeds and pod, orange zest, caster sugar and cream into a medium pan and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks together in a large bowl. Pour the hot cream mixture slowly on to the eggs, whisking all the time. Return the mix to a clean pan and stir constantly over a gentle heat for about 5 mins until the mixture has just thickened. Pass through a sieve and leave to cool for 30 mins. Churn in an ice-cream machine (or make by hand, see 'Try' below). Add the marmalade and continue to churn for another 10 mins until thick.Scoop the ice cream into the cake-lined bowl, leaving a central indent for the sorbet layer. Sit a small bowl in the top of the ice cream to make a smooth indent for the sorbet later to sit in. Freeze for at least 1 hr, until just firm.Fill the centre of the bombe with orange sorbet, cover the entire base of the bowl with a layer of sponge, cover with cling film and return to the freezer until needed, or at least 8 hrs ahead. This can be done well in advance and that\u2019s all the really hard work done. To make the hot chocolate sauce, grate the chocolate into a bowl and add the golden syrup, butter and warm water. Melt over a pan of just simmering water until melted, stirring occasionally. About 20 mins before serving, heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8. Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt in a large clean bowl until stiff but not dry. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, bringing it back to stiff peaks before each addition. Turn the bombe out onto an ovenproof serving dish and remove the cling film. Spoon the meringue all over the bombe to completely seal it. Using the back of the spoon or a palette knife, pull the meringue into dramatic swirls. Bake for 10-15 mins or until golden. Reheat the chocolate sauce over a pan as before or in a microwaveable bowl for 1 min on Low, stirring halfway through. Take the Chocolate orange bombe Alaska to the table immediately and serve sliced, drizzled with the hot chocolate sauce.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Preheat the oven to 375? F. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add onion, poblano and jalapeno, and saute for 5-6 minutes until the onions are cooked and translucent. Remove from heat.To assemble the enchiladas, place a tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a tablespoon or two of the avocado sauce down the middle of the tortilla. Then layer on some of the vegetable mixture, shredded chicken and cheese. Carefully roll the tortilla and place it seam side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Drizzle the top with about half of the remaining avocado cream sauce, then cover the dish with foil and bake for about 20 minutes, or until tortillas are heated through and begin to harden.Remove from the oven, then serve individual enchiladas drizzled with the remainder of the avocado cream sauce. You can also garnish with additional cilantro, cheese, and/or sour cream.To Make Avocado Cream Sauce:Melt the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the flour, whisking until golden and bubbly, about 2-3 minutes. Slowly whisk the broth into the flour mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the sour cream, cumin, salt, garlic powder and pepper, whisking if necessary to remove any lumps. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a blender or food processor. Add avocados, cilantro and lime juice, and pulse until smooth and well-blended. (Be very careful blending hot liquids -- the heat will expand! So be sure to remove the lid occasionally so that the heat can escape.)

Draw a 9-inch circle on parchment paper (using a large plate or the bottom of a tart pan).Place parchment paper on a large baking sheet--pencil side facing down.Prepare Raspberry Curd:Combine the raspberries, egg yolks, sugar, unsalted butter, lemon juice, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan and mix together. Place saucepan over medium heat until the mixture begins to bubble. Boil, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes, or until the curd has reduced, thickened, and the cornstarch has cooked completely (the curd will still be relatively thin). Remove from the heat, strain curd through a fine-meshed sieve into a heatproof bowl. Cover and allow curd to cool completely (it will thicken slightly) in the refrigerator.Prepare and Bake Meringue: Place the egg whites in the bowl (clean and free of any grease) of stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk over low speed for 1-2 minutes, or until egg whites are foamy. Increase speed to highand continue to whisk for an additional 1-2 minutes. Slowly start sprinkling in the granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time, while continue to whisk until meringue reaches a stiff peak.Add the vanilla bean paste, cornstarch, and vinegar, and whisk at high speed to combine. Scrape the bottom of a bowl with a spatula to ensure that all the ingredients are incorporated. Transfer the meringue to the center of the circle on the parchment paper. Using asmalloffset spatula, smooth it into a disk using the edges of the circle as a guide. Go back to the disk with an offset spatula and build up the sides of the meringue slightly--this will help containthe whipped cream, curd, and fresh raspberries when you assemble the dessert.Bake the meringue at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for roughly 1 hour. Turn off the heat, use a wooden spoon to prop open the oven door slightly, and allow the meringue to completely cool in the oven (roughly 1 hour). It will be crisp and slightly cracked on the outside, but slightly soft on the inside.Whip Cream:Combine the cold cream and vanilla bean paste in the clean bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment (or alternatively, use a hand-held mixer). Beat the cream until it reaches soft peaks (don't over beat!).Assemble:Spread the top of the meringue with the whipped cream. Top the cream with the chilled raspberry curd, and garnish with fresh raspberries. Sift confectioners' sugar on top of the fresh raspberries.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the filling:Toss the peaches in a large bowl with the zest and lemon juice. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir to combine. Divide the filling evenly between the ramekins.For the topping:Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor except the water. Pulse until combined, this will take about 30 seconds. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time until mixture is  clumpy but crumbly.Top each ramekin with the topping. Be sure to loosely sprinkle the topping and not pack it down. The idea is to look very crumbly and craggy.Place the ramekins on a sheet tray and bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is hot and bubbly and the topping, brown and crispy.Note: This is great served hot with vanilla ice cream.
