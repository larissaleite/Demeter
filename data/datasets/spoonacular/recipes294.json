Pulse your cauliflower florets in a food processor until they resemble fine crumbles or couscous (don't over-process to a paste). Alternatively you can hand grate the cauliflower using the fine holes on your grater.Place the processed cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for 7 minutes. No need to add any liquid, the cauliflower will steam itself. While cauliflower is cooking, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat.Take the cauliflower out and stir it repeatedly to release steam and cool it down, until it is lukewarm (not hot) to the touch.To the bowl with the cauliflower, add the mozzarella, egg, oregano, minced fresh garlic, turmeric, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir the mixture with a fork until well blended.Place the cauliflower mixture in a pile in the center of the lined baking sheet. Gently press out the mixture to form a 9-10 inch circle of even thickness, making sure to keep the center as thin as the edges. This is the beginning of your cauliflower \"crust.\"Use your fingers to gently press against the outer edge of the crust to form a small edge around the circle.Lay both hands flat in the center of the circle and GENTLY press to flatten out the middle, ensuring an even thickness throughout the crust.Place the crust into the hot oven and let it bake for about 20 minutes, turning the baking sheet around once halfway through baking, till the crust is golden brown. While crust is cooking, slice the tomatoes thin and shred or chiffonade the basil.Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool for 5-10 minutes. Use a spatula to very gently slide the cooked crust off of the parchment paper directly onto a greased baking sheet. Preheat your oven's broiler. Spread out the pesto onto the center surface of the crust to the outer edges. Sprinkle half of the goat cheese evenly across the top of the pesto. Lay the sliced tomatoes on, then sprinkle the rest of the goat cheese across the top. Sprinkle the surface evenly with crushed red pepper flakes.Place the tomato tart into the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3-4 minutes until hot and bubbly, keeping an eye on the crust to make sure it doesn't burn (it will get dark brown but shouldn't blacken).Remove the tart from the oven and sprinkle with fresh basil.
