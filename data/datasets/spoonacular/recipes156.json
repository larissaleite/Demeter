Once the beans are cooled, place them in a spice grinder or food processor and grind until a fine powder forms. Sift the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding any large bits.</p><p>2. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl and sift the confectioners' sugar and the cornstarch together. Spray the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish with nonstick spray. Sift 2 tablespoons of the sugar-cornstarch mixture evenly over the dish and reserve the extra sugar-cornstarch mixture in an airtight container.</p><p>3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, place  cup of the water and sprinkle the powdered gelatin over the top in an even layer. Set the gelatin aside to bloom. In a small saucepan, add the reserved vanilla powder and the granulated sugar and stir to combine. Add the honey, corn syrup, salt and the remaining  cup of water to the saucepan and stir to combine. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Once the mixture is boiling, stir once with a rubber spatula, then continue to cook without stirring, until the mixture reaches 240 on a candy thermometer, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully remove the pan from the heat and turn on the stand mixer. With the mixer whisking on low speed, slowly pour in the hot sugar syrup, mixing on low until the gelatin dissolves. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until the mixture is light, fluffy and tripled in size, about 10 minutes. Spray a spatula with nonstick spray and use the spatula to transfer the marshmallow mixture to the prepared pan. Spread the marshmallows in an even layer and cover the pan with plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.</p><p>4. Once the marshmallows have set, dust a cutting board evenly with some of the reserved sugar-cornstarch mixture and flip the pan of marshmallows over onto the dusted board. Remove the marshmallows from the pan and dust the top of the marshmallows evenly with some of the sugar-cornstarch mixture. Spray a knife or pizza cutter with nonstick spray and cut the marshmallows into 1-inch squares. Toss the cut marshmallows in the sugar-cornstarch mixture and shake off any excess coating. Transfer the marshmallows to an airtight container and store for up to 5 days.</p><p>5. Make the hot chocolate: Preheat the oven to 350F. Add the chestnuts to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the chestnuts are broken up into small pieces the size of chickpeas. (If you don't have a food processor, this can be done by carefully chopping the chestnuts with a heavy knife.) Transfer the broken chestnuts in a single layer onto a baking sheet.</p><p>6. Use a paring knife to split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, then cut each half again lengthwise to make 4 long strips. Add the vanilla strips to the chestnuts and place in the oven. Roast for 15 minutes, until the chestnuts are fragrant.</p><p>7. While the chestnuts are roasting, in a large saucepan set over medium-high heat, add the milk and the cream and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm. Once the chestnuts and vanilla have finished roasting, immediately transfer them to the milk mixture. Stir to combine, then cover the pot with a lid and set aside to infuse for 2 hours.</p><p>8. After 2 hours, return the saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil. Place a strainer over a large bowl and strain the mixture through, discarding the chestnuts. Return the chestnut-infused milk to the saucepan. Add the chestnut paste and use a whisk or an immersion blender to fully incorporate the paste. Add the chocolate and blend or whisk until the chocolate is melted and completely incorporated. The roasted chestnut hot chocolate can be made and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</p><p>9. To serve, rewarm the chestnut hot chocolate over medium-low heat and divide among 8 mugs. Top the hot chocolate with the marshmallows and serve.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/roasted-chestnut-hot-chocolate-with-toasted-vanilla-bean-marshmallows-668440", "dishTypes": ["beverage", "drink"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cookie Madness", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Similar-to-Potbelly-Sugar-Cookies-258581.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 12, "id": 258581, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Similar to Potbelly Sugar Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 56.96, "creditText": "Cookie Madness", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "6.8 oz bleached AP flour (1 \u00bd cups)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "bleached flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg (46 grams)**", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 46.0, "id": 1123, "unit": "grams"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons light corn syrup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light corn syrup", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19350, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons regular or butter flavored shortening (48 grams)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "butter flavor shortening", "metaInformation": ["flavored"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 48.0, "id": 4615, "unit": "grams"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter (57 grams", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract or use McCormick Vanilla, Butter & Nut Extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon almond extract or use another 1/4 teaspoon of extra vanilla if using the Vanilla Butter & Nut Extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 34.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.cookiemadness.net/2011/04/potbelly-sugar-cookies/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 23, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg", "id": 405907, "name": "mixing bowl"}], "step": "Thoroughly mix together the flour, baking powder and baking soda;

It's really up to you.While the crust is baking, prepare your chicken and toss it the BBQ sauce. Set aside.When crust is done, top with the chicken, mozzarella, and red onions.Place back in the oven to bake a little longer or until cheese melts.Top with basil.Cut, serve, & enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bbq-chicken-pizza-594437", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Desserts with Benefits", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthy-Peanut-Butter-Apple-Yogurt-Dip-(sugar-free--low-carb--low-fat---high-protein)-608402.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 608402, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Healthy Peanut Butter Apple Yogurt Dip (sugar free, low carb, low fat & high protein)", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 169.99, "creditText": "Desserts with Benefits", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "almond milk", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93607, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup Unsweetened Applesauce", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "applesauce", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/applesauce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9019, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup Plain, Nonfat Greek Yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "nonfat greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["plain"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "120g (1 cup) Peanut Flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "peanut flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpea-flour-or-another-gluten-free-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16100, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/8 tsp Pink Himalayan Salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pink himalayan salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/himalayan-pink-salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 1032047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp Stevia Extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "stevia extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/stevia.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93628, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 93.0, "sourceUrl": "http://dessertswithbenefits.com/healthy-peanut-butter-apple-yogurt-dip/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/plastic-wrap.jpg", "id": 404730, "name": "plastic wrap"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}], "step": "In a blender or food processor, add the yogurt, applesauce, almond milk and stevia.

Add the flour, baking, soda and stir to just incorporate; batter will be thick (Note regarding flour- I live in San Diego and it's incredibly dry here this time of year and I likely need less flour than other climates. I used 2 1/4 cups plus about 2 tablespoons flour. Depending on your climate and humidity, you may wish to start with 2 1/4 cups and increase to 2 1/2 cups flour, as necessary. The dough should be quite thick, albeit sticky and tacky, courtesy of the molasses) Fold in the chocolate chips and chocolate baking chunks (I used nearly 6 ounces; using a total of 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips is okay if you don't have baking chocolate or a chocolate bar to chop). Cover mixing bowl or transfer batter to an airtight food storage container and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days, prior to baking. Preheat oven to 350F, line two baking trays with Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats liners, parchment, or spray with cooking spray; set aside.
