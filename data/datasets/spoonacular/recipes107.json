When potatoes are cold, cut into medium sized chunks and saute in 1 tablespoon of margarine and 1 tablespoon of butter. When the potatoes are almost finished sauteing, begin to cook the bacon crisply and cut into small pieces. Set aside. Just before the potatoes are browned, sprinkle garlic, onions, salt and pepper onto the potatoes. Drain off excess oil. Set aside. Saute mushrooms. Set aside. Whip 3 eggs together. Grease a 10-inch omelet pan with margarine over a medium heat. Have all other ingredients ready to assemble quickly after the eggs are cooked. Put the eggs in a pan and cook slowly over a medium heat. With a spatula, push the eggs to the center of the pan. Remember that this is an open omelet so do not fold over. As the eggs begin to seal on the bottom, keep folding the loose eggs under the cooked portion. When almost all the loose egg is cooked, clip the eggs over. Lay the cooked eggs flat on a plate. Spread sour cream, and then place potatoes on the eggs, followed with mushrooms, tomatoes and bacon. Top with feta cheese.

Tip a little grated chocolate into each dish, roll the dish around tilting it as you do so it is evenly lined all round. For the cr\u00e8me patisserie, mix the flour, sugar and cornflour. Put egg yolk and whole egg into a bowl, stir, then beat in half of the flour mixture to give a smooth paste. Tip in the rest of the flour mixture and mix well.Pour the milk and cream into a pan and bring just to the boil. Remove from the heat. Add the chocolate and beat until it is melted and smooth with no lumps.Gradually stir hot chocolate mix into paste. Return to pan. Cook, stirring, over a medium-low heat for 5 mins to a smooth, thick paste. Remove from the heat. Leave until cold, beating occasionally with a wire whisk.Make the ganache: slowly warm the cream in a pan. Just before it boils, take off the heat and add chocolate. Beat constantly to a velvety texture, gradually sprinkling in the cocoa as it dissolves. Allow to cool.Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks with an electric whisk. Sprinkle in the sugar as you are mixing. Keep whisking to give stiff, firm peaks to give volume to the souffl\u00e9s.Mix cr\u00e8me patisserie and ganache in a large bowl. Stir in 2 tbsp of egg white. Carefully fold in a third of the rest, cutting through the mixture. Fold in another third (take care not to lose the volume); fold in the rest.Spoon the mixture into the dishes to fill them by three-quarters, then gently press a spoon in to make sure it fills all the gaps. Fill the dishes to the top with the mixture, then bang each dish on to the surface so the mixture fills the sides.Take a palette knife and pull it across the top of each dish so the mixture is completely flat. Take a little time to wipe any splashes off the outside of each dish, or they will burn on while cooking.So mixture won\u2019t stick to the top of the mould, and to give a straight finish, go around the top edge of the mixture with your finger. Sprinkle a little grated chocolate in the centre, then bake the souffl\u00e9s for 15-17 mins.The souffl\u00e9s should have risen by about two thirds of their original height and jiggle when moved, but be set on top.

Line one 12-cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Stir the milk and vanilla together in a small bowl. Set aside.Add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer).Mix on low speed until the butter is smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add half the milk mixture and beat until smooth. Repeat, adding flour, then milk, and then the rest of the flour, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat briefly to make a smooth batter.Put the egg whites in a clean bowl. Whip on high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. Fold the whites into the batter in three batches. Divide the cake batter evenly between the liners.Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, rotating the tin about halfway through, about 20 minutes.Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tin. Cool on the rack completely.

Drain and set aside.  Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven.  Saut\u00e9 yellow onion, garlic and half of the green onions in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes until the onions are opaque and fragrant.  Add carrots, ranch dressing seasoning and 2 tablespoons cilantro.  Stir to combine and saut\u00e9 until the carrots begin to soften.Add chicken broth, buffalo sauce, cheddar, parmesan and shredded chicken.  Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, until the carrots are tender, but still have a slight bite.Bring the soup to a boil, add the underdone orzo and stir frequently until orzo is al dente.

"Prepare canner and wash/sterilize 8 half-pint (or equivalent) mason jars. Keep jars in hot (not boiling) water until ready to use. Warm lids in hot (not boiling) water to sterilize and soften seal.Core and quarter apples, removing any obvious bruises or blemishes. Place apples in a large, heavy saucepan filled with 1 inch of filtered tap or spring water. Cover and simmer over high heat until apples are soft, about 10 to 20 minutes (cooking time will depending on the variety and ripeness of your apples).Meanwhile, cook blackberries in a small saucepan over medium heat until softened, about 5 to 10 minutes.Run cooked apples and blackberries through a food mill*, discarding skins and seeds. Return mixture to saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add lemon juice, along with sugar to taste (the sweeter your apples, the less sugar you will need. Start with a little bit, then taste, and add more as desired).Ladle hot sauce into jars, leaving 1/2-inch of headspace. Remove any air bubbles, and carefully wipe jar rims and threads. Center lids and screw on ring bands until fingertip-tight. Place jars in water bath, ensuring they are completely covered by at least 1-inch with water. Bring to a full rolling boil and process for 15 minutes (20 minutes if you are using larger pint jars). Uncover and remove from heat; let sit for 5 minutes to allow the pressure to equalize. Carefully lift jars from water and arrange on a wire rack. Let cool completely, undisturbed, for 12 to 24 hours. Check seals. Store jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Any unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 3 weeks.*If you don't have a food mill, you\u2019ll want to peel your apples first before coring and cooking them. After cooking, mash with a potato masher for a chunkier sauce, or puree in a food processor or blender (in batches if necessary) for a smoother sauce.

Whisk constantly until brown bits appear on the bottom, about 5-6 minutes, then immediately remove from heat and set aside. Combine all the remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor. Add the browned butter and pulse for 30 seconds or until well combined. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.Heat a 12 inch non-stick pan. Add butter or cooking spray (I like to use cooking spray) to coat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. Makes about 10 crepes.!SaladHeat a grill pan or grill over medium heat and lightly oil the grates. Brush each half of the peaches with balsamic glaze and then place them flesh side down on the hot grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes or until lightly charred and caramelized. Remove from the grill.In a bowl toss together the micro greens, spring lettuce mix and cherries. Roughly tear the prosciutto into pieces and add to the salad. Gently toss.In another small bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest + juice, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.Divide the crepes among 4 plates or a large serving platter. Stuff each crepe with a little of the salad and then top with crumbled gorgonzola. Add the peaches and drizzle the entire salad with the olive oil dressing. Drizzle with honey (don't skip this!). Add the eggs and sprinkle the entire salad with salt and pepper. If desired serve with more balsamic glaze.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/caramelized-peach-+-cherry-prosciutto-and-gorgonzola-salad-w-buckwheat-crpes-606792", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
