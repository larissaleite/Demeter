Using the paddle attachment, beat on low for 30 seconds to combine.Add the butter and remaining milk and beat on low until moistened. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and for 90 seconds.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the egg mixture in 3 separate additions, beating on medium after each addition.Divide the batter evenly between the 2 pans (I used a scale to do this). Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Cool the cakes on wire racks for 10-15 minutes. After they are slightly cooled, run a knife around the edge of the pan, and invert the cakes onto the wire racks. Cool completely before frosting.With an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until it becomes pale and creamy (2-3 minutes).Add the powdered sugar and salt and beat on low until combined. Turn up to medium and beat for an additional 2-3 minutes.Add the vanilla extract and beat on medium, about 3 minutes.Add the cream 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Add the food coloring, one drop at a time until you reach the desired color. Beat until the food coloring is fully incorporated.Place one layer of the cake on an 8-inch cake board. Place 1 cup of the frosting on top, and spread evenly with a palette knife. Place the second layer on top of the first.Place a generous scoop of frosting on the top of the cake, and spread evenly across the top of the cake.

Increase the speed slightly and continue mixing until a ball of dough forms. Note: If dough is too dry, add a small amount of additional almond milk.Take dough in your hands and form it into a ball, then place on a floured surface. Press on the dough, forming it into a disc about 3/4-inch thick. If the dough splits around the edges, or if any of the walnuts poke out, press the dough back together and push the walnuts in.Cut disc into equal triangles and arrange on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Melt one to two tablespoons of butter in the microwave and lightly brush the triangles so that they're lightly coated in butter.

"instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. To prepare the tomato sauce, first pour the tomatoes into a mesh sieve or fine colander and let them drain off excess juice for a minute. Transfer drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper flakes. Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later (you should have about 2 cups sauce).Rinse out the food processor and return it to the machine. Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl. No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put it back onto the machine because you'll need it later.Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and  teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the artichoke to the skillet, then add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach. Continue cooking for about 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until the spinach has dramatically reduce in volume and very little moisture remains in the bottom of the pan.Transfer the spinach artichoke mixture to the bowl of the food processor and pulse until the contents are finely chopped (but not pured!), about 12 to 15 times. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with remaining cottage cheese and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Now it's lasagna assembly time!Spread  cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of an 8-by-8 or 9-by-9 inch square baker. Layer three lasagna noodles on top, overlapping their edges as necessary. Spread half of the spinach mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with  cup tomato sauce, then sprinkle  cup shredded cheese on top.Top with three more noodles, followed by the remaining spinach mixture. Sprinkle  cup shredded cheese on top. (We're skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Top with three more noodles, then spread the remaining tomato sauce over the top so the noodles are evenly covered. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.Wrap the lasagna with a layer of parchment paper over the top (or cover tightly with aluminum foil, but don't let the foil touch the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18 minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180 degrees and continue cooking for about 12 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty brown.

If you're using whole nuts, chop the toasted nuts into small pieces on a cutting board.Meanwhile, pop the popcorn: First, place a large mixing bowl near the stove. Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed pan with a lid. Turn the heat up to medium, add 2 kernels of corn, and cover. Once the kernels pop, remove the lid and pour in the remaining popcorn kernels. Cover the pot and give the pot a little shimmy to distribute the kernels evenly.Cook over medium heat, shaking the pot occasionally. Crack the lid just a smidge so the popcorn stays crisp, and cook until the popping sound slows to about one pop per every few seconds. Remove the pan from heat and dump the popcorn your bowl, taking care not to pour in any unpopped kernels at the bottom of the pot. If necessary, pick out any unpopped kernels that made it into the bowl with a spoon.To make the caramel sauce: In a small, heavy bottomed pot, bring the maple syrup to a boil over medium heat. Keep a watchful eye on the syrup and continue boiling for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, reducing heat only if necessary to prevent overflow. Remove the pot from heat.Add the nut butter, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon to the pot of maple syrup. Whisk until well blended.

Pour the popcorn on the parchment-covered baking sheet and arrange it in a single layer.Bake the popcorn for 6 minutes, then rotate the pan and cook for another 2 minutes.

coarse sand.Press at the bottom of an 8\" greased springform pan (I used coconut oil)In the bowl of your food processor, add all the ingredients of \"part I\" except for the coconut milk and process until well combined and smooth.With the motor running, add coconut milk through the feeding tube and keep processing until well incorporated. Scrape the sides once or twice if necessary.  In a small saucepan, bring the second can of coconut milk to a slow simmer. Do not let this boil.Put the chopped cacao paste in a large mixing bowl and pour the simmering milk right over it. Let this stand for a few minutes to allow the chocolate to melt then very delicately mix with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. It might tend to separate a little bit but if it does, don't worry too much about it. Just give it a good whisk and it should become smooth again. Now add that to the chocolate mixture that's already in the food processor and process until lusciously smooth. Pour over reserved crust and refrigerate at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, before removing from pan. I find the best way to do this is by heating the side of the pan slightly with a propane torch or warm cloth. You could also run a knife around the edge, but that would likely leave some light indentations... Place cacao butter in the microwave and cook on high until completely melted, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Add honey and coconut butter and mix until well incorporated, then place back in the microwave and cook in 15-30 seconds intervals, stirring between each, until smooth and soft enough to be drizzled. Transfer this white chocolate to a squeeze bottle and squeeze all over cake in a back and forth motion. This sets rather rapidly so you need to act quickly! If you don't have a squeeze bottle, you could also drizzle it with a fork. Sprinkle chopped pecans all over cake and decorate with pecan halves. This cake is easier to slice with a slightly warmed blade and is much tastier if you leave it at room temperature for a couple of hours before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-truffle-cake-551595", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": ["asian", "thai"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Thai-Salmon-Salad-470076.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 470076, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Thai Salmon Salad", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 teaspoons brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons fish sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "fish sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asian-fish-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 6179, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 cup chopped fresh basil", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh basil", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 head lettuce", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11252, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons lime juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9160, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 onion, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "salmon fillet", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salmon.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 15076, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "4 Thai chiles, chopped", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "thai chiles", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thai-chiles.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11670, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 large tomato, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomato", "metaInformation": ["large", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11529, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 95.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Thai-Salmon-Salad/Detail.aspx?src=rss", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 43, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Spray a small 7\u201d pie plate (or other similar sized pan) with cooking spray. Place the water, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.

Line two standard muffin pans with 20 cupcake liners. For the cupcakes: Put 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, the egg whites and whole egg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes. Pour into another bowl and set aside. Clean the mixing bowl. Put the remaining 1 cup sugar and the butter in the clean mixing bowl and beat on medium-high for about 30 seconds. Add the flour, milk, sour cream, baking powder and vanilla. Beat on medium until combined and fairly smooth. Return the egg mixture to the mixing bowl and stir just until incorporated. Using a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner with batter.Bake the cupcakes until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the tops are light golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pans to cooling racks and cool for about 10 minutes, and then transfer the cupcakes to the racks and allow to cool completely before filling and frosting. For the quatro leches mixture: Whisk the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk and heavy cream in a mixing bowl to combine. Transfer to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate. When the cupcakes are cool, make the frosting: Combine the cream, powdered sugar and vanilla in a chilled mixing bowl. Whip until medium-stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over whip. Chill briefly if not using right away. To assemble: Use a chopstick or fat skewer to poke 4 or 5 holes halfway through each cupcake. Squeeze some of the quatro leches mixture into each hole; you can let it sink in a bit and then squeeze in some more to fill. Frost generously with the whipped cream frosting.                                                            Tip: These cupcakes get even more moist if you let them sit overnight - if you do that, frost them right before you serve them.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and shallot and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the shallot is tender. Stir in the lemon juice, sugar, and remaining 5 tablespoons vegetable oil.2. Transfer half this mixture to a food processor and pulse a few times to finely chop. Combine this with the remaining apple/shallot mixture in a medium bowl. Whisk in the vinegar, nut oil, mustard, thyme, lemon zest, and peppercorns. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. (Refrigerate the dressing if making more than 1 hour in advance; allow it to come to room temperature before serving.)Make the nut crust3. Combine the nuts, lemon zest, thyme, salt, mustard, and cayenne in the food processor. Pulse 10 to 15 times to finely chop the nuts, until they have a texture of bread crumbs; avoid overprocessing. You don\u2019t want to make nut paste. Transfer to a shallow dish.Make the halibut4. Stir together the melted butter and vegetable oil in a shallow dish. Dip the halibut in this to evenly coat, allowing the excess to drip off. Immediately coat the fish evenly with the nut crust and set on the baking sheet.
