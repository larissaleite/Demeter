Put a 10-inch cast iron skillet into the oven and heat for at least 8 minutes.2 Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan or in a microwave. Of the 3 tablespoons, one tablespoon will be for the batter and two for the pan.3 In a blender, put the eggs, egg white, milk, 1 tablespoon of the melted butter, sugar, flour, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt.  Blend until you have a smooth, creamy batter. This should take about 30 seconds. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the blender carafe with a rubber spatula if necessary.4 Carefully remove the very hot skillet from the oven. (Watch out, the handle is HOT!  Make sure to use a thick pot holder so you don't burn your hands.) Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter in the pan and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.  Gently pour the batter into the hot skillet, making sure not to splatter batter all over the sides of the pan. Carefully return the pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. The Dutch baby will puff up around the edges, even to the point that the sides will obscure the center. It's a wondrous sight to behold when watching through the oven window! Do not open the door to peek, though, as opening the oven door even a crack while baking may cause your Dutch baby to fall.5 Once the Dutch baby is done baking, remove the skillet from the oven (again, take care, the handle is HOT) and use a thin spatula to gently coax the pancake onto a large plate. It may fall slightly once removed from the heat, which is totally normal. To serve, cut into wedges and sprinkle with powdered sugar (and more cinnamon if you wish) and a splash of lemon juice.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/dutch-baby-246511",

After starting the machine, add green food coloring to the mix to achieve the color you prefer (I recommend adding a very small amount at first and increasing as it mixes in if desired).  Prepare ice cream in an ice cream maker per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  To prepare the ice cream without a machine, click here.Scoop half of the chilled ice cream into a large 3-4 quart freezer-safe container.  Evenly distribute the M&M\u2019s, chopped Andes mints, chocolate almonds and mini marshmallows over the ice cream.  Scoop the remaining ice cream over the candy.With a large mixing spoon, fold the ingredients in together so the candy is well mixed into the soft ice cream.

Line a baking sheet with foil and place a metal cooling rack on top if you have one (it can work without, too). Soak the chicken in the buttermilk. Mix the panko, cornmeal, olive oil, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Remove the chicken one piece at a time, let the buttermilk drip off, and gently press into the panko cornmeal mixture until coated with crumbs. Place the chicken on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. At 10 minutes, flip each piece and bake for another 10 minutes (so total bake time for the chicken is about 20 minutes).Meanwhile, as your chicken bakes, pulse all the sauce ingredients in a food processor. This is optional, but to help the sauce develop its flavor and thicken a bit, you can put it in a skillet over medium low heat and let it simmer for a while. Prepare your broccoli by boiling for 1 minute and plunging into ice water (it stays so bright green and crispy!) or stir frying until tender crisp.When the chicken is done, dip each piece in the sauce and return to the baking sheet. Bake another 5 minutes, re-dip for one last sauce love, and let rest for a minute or two.

    In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the lard and butter, or just the butter, and using a pastry blender, or two knives, cut the fat into the flour until the particles are the size of small peas. Using your fingertips, rub the flour and fat mixture until the lard and the butter are fairly small and the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the sugar, nutmeg, allspice, the dried fruit, and lemon rind.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a small bowl with a fork, beat the egg, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of milk. Sprinkle the egg mixture over the flour mixture and use the fork to start stirring it in, tossing the dough until it forms medium clumps. Then reach into the dough with both hands and, working quickly, keep tossing it until it feels moist, squeezing the dough together to form one mass. If the dough won't hold together, add a bit more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Lightly flour your work surface, place the dough on it, and roll over the dough to flatten it; continue rolling until it is 1/3-inch thick. Use the cutter to stamp out rounds. Transfer them to the sheet or tray. Reroll and restamp the scraps, using all the dough.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Heat a cast-iron skillet over low heat. Carefully transfer the cakes to the skillet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Cook over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes or until the bottoms are deep golden brown. Turn over carefully with a spatula turner and cook the second sides for 5 more minutes. The surfaces should feel crisp when tapped.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Transfer the cakes to a wire rack. Cook the remaining cakes in the same way. Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            For the rendered lard: (makes about 10 cups)                                                                                                                            7                                                                            With a sharp knife, cut the lard into approximately 1 inch cubes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Place the cubes of lard into a heavy pot, preferably enameled cast iron and add the water. Cover the pot and let the lard render for an initial ten minutes; then remove the lid. Maintaining the very low heat, slowly bring the lard to a temperature at which the liquid is barely simmering. Continue to render the lard for 1 to 2 hours, until the bits of cracklings are golden brown and very small, and the liquid fat is pale and golden.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Strain the cracklings from the lard, pressing down on the mesh of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible from the solids. Set aside the cracklings for another use. Cool the lard to room temperature and refrigerate until solid. The lard may be kept in airtight containers for several months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/the-nasty-bits-how-to-render-leaf-lard-with-welsh-griddle-cakes--196477",

Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Line a 9 x 13-inch pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides (I spray mine with cooking spray).2.   Make the crust: Place 28 Oreos in a food processor and process until finely ground. Pour into a large bowl, add the melted butter, and stir with a flexible spatula until all crumbs are moistened. Place the cookie-crumb mixture in the lined pan and, using your fingers, press the mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom. Bake 10 minutes, then remove to a wire cooling rack (leave the oven on) while you make the filling. Snap the remaining Oreos in half, put them in the food processor, and turn on and off quickly a few times, just until the cookies are roughly chopped.3.   Make the filling: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the cream cheese and sugar until well blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a flexible spatula and beat again until uniform. Beat in sour cream, vanilla and salt. Scrape down the bowl and mix again. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. After beating in the last egg, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat one more time, to make sure the mixture is fully combined. Stir in chopped Oreos with the same spatula.4.   Pour the cream cheese mixture over the baked cookie crust, smooth the top with the spatula, and bake for 40 minutes, until the filling is set around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center when you gently shake the pan. Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. When cool, cover it with foil and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours. (I chill mine overnight)5.   To cut, use the foil overhang to lift the cheesecake out of the pan and place on a large cutting board. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut the cheesecake into bars, rinsing off the knife with hot water and wiping it dry between each cut.



Mix in 1 cup of cornstarch a little bit at a time until the chicken cubes are well coated.                            In batches, carefully drop the chicken cubes into the hot oil one by one, cooking until they turns golden brown and begin to float, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool as you fry the next batch. Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Cook until the chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.                            Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir a minute or two until the garlic has turned golden and the chiles brighten. Add 1/2 cup sugar, the ginger, chicken broth, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and peanut oil; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.                            Dissolve 2 teaspoons of cornstarch into the water, and stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute. Stir the chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook for a few minutes until the chicken absorbs some of the sauce.

Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, optional salt; set aside. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the next 5 wet ingredients (through vanilla). Add the wet mixture to the dry, mixing lightly with a spoon or folding with a spatula until just combined. Lumps will be present and this is okay. Don't overmix or try to stir them smooth; set aside. In a small bowl, toss the fruit with 1 tablespoon flour. The flour helps to prevent the fruit from sinking while baking. Gently and briefly fold the fruit into batter. I used a frozen fruit blend with cherries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. If using frozen, add the fruit frozen and do not thaw because frozen fruit runs and bleeds less than if\u00a0 thawed. If using fresh fruit, baking time will be significantly (possibly drastically) less because the fruit is much warmer and won't chill down the batter overall, nor will it release any where near the water into the batter that frozen fruit does. Turn batter out into prepared pan; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the cream cheese with 1 tablespoon sugar until smooth. Dollop the cream cheese mixture haphazardly over the cake batter. With a toothpick, gently and lightly swirl the cream cheese. I don't do much swirling because I like to see bigger, noticeable patches of cream cheese rather than thin streaks in my cake; personal preference. Bake until done. I hesitate to give a baking range because you must watch your cake, not the clock. Bake until center is slightly domed and set, golden and rosy in color, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. I estimate 50 to 55 minutes is a good range if using frozen fruit. At any time your cake is beginning to look a bit too golden brown before you suspect the center will set up, tent it with a sheet of foil laid across the top. I baked for 52 minutes total, and at the 45 minute mark, I tented with foil. Baking times will range dramatically based on if baking with fresh or frozen berries; ranging from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the temperature of the berries going into the batter and how much water they release. Place pan on a wire rack and allow cake to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Optionally, dust with confectioners' sugar or a simple glaze.

The easiest way to do this is to place the grated zucchinis in the middle of a clean dish towel, fold the top and bottom flaps over the zucchini then twist both ends to form a little bundle, then twist and squeeze the bejesus out of that bundle until no more liquid comes out. Add the squeezed zucchini to a mixing bowl, along with the rest of the ingredients and mix delicately until all the ingredients are evenly combined. Heat a splash of coconut oil or avocado oil in a frying pan set over medium heat and, when oil is nice and hot, add a generous 1/4 cup of mixture for each fritter. Slightly flatten and help shape them delicately with a fork, if necessary. Cook 3 or 4 fritters at a time for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they form a nice golden brown crust.

To prepare the chicken breasts:  Use a knife to make a pocket inside each chicken breast, making sure that you just open one long edge of the breast and don't cut through to the other side.  Tuck a few pieces of cheese into each pocket.  Secure closed again with toothpicks.  Sprinkle each chicken breast generously with salt and pepper.  Heat a medium nonstick skillet to medium-high heat.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the chicken breasts to the pan.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Cook the breasts 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  I like to cook the first side, then flip over and add a lid for the remainder of the cooking time.  Make the sauce while the chicken is cooking.2.  To prepare the sauce:  Heat the butter in a medium stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and saute in the butter until they begin to turn golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes (turning down heat, if necessary).  Add the apples, sage and garlic and continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and let it bubble for a few minutes, naturally reducing.  Stir in the cream and bacon and heat until creamy and heated through.3.  Place each chicken breast on a serving plate, pull out the toothpicks, and top each with a generous scoop of the apple- bacon pan sauce.

Add water, all at once, and mix without kneading using a wooden spoon, 14-cup food processor, or heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Mix until everything is evenly moist with no dry patches. The dough will be shaggy, wet, and loose.Cover with lid (not airtight) or plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until top of dough flattens, about 2 hours. If desired, let rise overnight. Refrigerate dough (lidded or wrapped in plastic) and use over next 14 days. Note that fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with. Refrain from punching dough down.To bake:Prepare a pizza peel by sprinkling liberally with cornmeal or lining with parchment. Dust the surface of your refrigerated dough with flour. Pull up and cut off a 1-pound (grapefruit size) piece of dough.With lightly floured hands, gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating a quarter-turn as you form a ball. The bottom may appear uneven but will flatten out during resting and baking. The final shape should be smooth and cohesive. If you prefer a oval-shape, elongate the dough with your hands and taper the ends by rolling them between your palms and pinching. The entire shaping process should only take 20-40 seconds, any longer and your loaf could be dense.Allow shaped loaf to rest for 90 minutes (40 minutes if you're using fresh, unrefrigerated dough). 30 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone placed on the middle rack. Place an empty broiler tray for holding water for steam on any other rack that won't interfere with the rising bread.Just before baking, use a pastry brush to paint the top of loaf with water. Sprinkle with seed mixture (if desired). Slash the loaf with 1/4-inch deep parallel cuts across the top using a serrated knife.With a quick forward-jerking motion of the wrist, slide the loaf off the pizza peel and onto preheated baking stone.

fennel in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then add 8 cups room temperature water and the shrimp. Put the squid and the scallops in a fine-mesh strainer and lower them directly into the court bouillon. Gently poach the seafood until cooked through and tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the seafood to a plate, strain the court bouillon into a bowl, and then add the seafood back to the court bouillon. Add a few ice cubes to cool the liquid down. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.For the seafood salad: In a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon zest and juice, olive oil, oregano and black pepper. Whisk well. With a slotted spoon, remove the chilled seafood from the court bouillon and add it to the bowl along with the cherry tomatoes, olives, pepperoncinis and bell peppers. Toss well.Arrange a bed of arugula on a large serving platter. Mound the seafood salad on top and garnish with the feta and capers. Serve immediately.                                                            Cook Notes: Before slicing, check the squid tubes for any unremoved quills. If you find any, just pull them out and discard.

Special Equipment:  Chimney starter, newspaper, vegetable oil, 4 pounds natural lump charcoal, and metal skewersCombine 1 tablespoon of the garam masala, 1 teaspoon of the salt, cumin, coriander, and pepper in a 1-gallon resealable bag. Seal and shake the bag to combine.  Add the lamb and shake to coat.  Add the yogurt to the bag, seal and squish to coat. Refrigerate the bag in a leak proof container for 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.Spritz 4 to 5 pieces of newspaper with vegetable oil and put in the bottom of a charcoal chimney starter.  Fill the chimney with half of the charcoal and light the newspaper.When the charcoal is lightly covered with gray ash, carefully pour it onto the bottom grate of a kettle grill and spread evenly.  Top with the remaining unlit charcoal, spreading evenly so as not to suffocate the lit charcoal.  Set the second grate in the kettle and cover until ready to cook.Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a 12-inch straight sided saute pan over medium-high, until it shimmers and almost begins to smoke.  Add the onion and remaining teaspoon of salt, and cook until the onion is browned around the edges, 11 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, ginger and chile. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions have softened and browned completely, approximately 7 minutes.  Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of garam masala and stir several times to coat.Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have reduced slightly and deepened in color, 15 to 20 minutes.Remove the lamb from the yogurt mixture, leaving as much yogurt on the meat as possible.  Thread the pieces of lamb, 1/4-inch apart, onto the skewers. Grill until the yogurt has slightly charred or blackened, about 2 minutes on each side.  Remove the lamb from the skewers.  Add the lamb and coconut milk to the tomato mixture and stir to combine and heat through.  Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with mint or cilantro and serve over basmati rice.                                                Garam Masala:                                        Combine all of the seeds, peppercorns, cloves, chile, and cinnamon in an 8-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, moving the pan constantly, until you smell the cumin toasting, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the mixture to a plate and spread out to cool for 5 minutes.Once cool, add the toasted mixture and nutmeg into a spice grinder. Process until a fine powder is formed, approximately 1 minute.  Use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.

the rice: Combine the rice and water together in a large saucepan. Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook the rice for 20 minutes.For the sauce: Peel the mango and slice the flesh off the pit. Dice the mango flesh.In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, oil, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the mango, cilantro, garlic, and ginger. Set aside.Heat a large, nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat.Rub the fish fillets with the oil, salt, and pepper. Place in the hot pan and sear until golden on 1 side, 3 to 4 minutes.Turn the fish over and cook until cooked through, another 3 to 4 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the fish. You'll know the fish is done when the flesh springs back. Remove the fish to a plate.When the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and gently stir in the cilantro and scallions. Season with salt, to taste.Place a mound of rice on each plate. Top with mahi-mahi. Spoon the mango sauce over each fillet and top with chopped scallions. Drizzle the liquid from the mango sauce around the rice.

(If you're going to dress the pasta within a couple of hours, leave the pesto at room temperature. Refrigerate for longer storage, up to 2 days, but let it return to room temperature before cooking the pasta.) To cook the spaghetti, heat 6 quarts of water, with 1 tablespoon salt to the boil in the large pot. Scrape all the pesto into a big warm bowl. Cook the spaghetti al dente, lift it from the cooking pot, drain briefly, and drop onto the pesto. Toss quickly to coat the spaghetti, sprinkle the cheese all over, and toss again.
