Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Let boil for about 2 minutes, until tan foam appears on the surface. Lower the heat to vigorously simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool completely. The finished glaze should be syrupy, with a strong salty sweetness. There should be 3 to 4 tablespoons.  For the tofu eel mix:  Use scissors to cut each sheet of nori in half lengthwise. Set aside 1 piece for the moment. Stack the remaining 3 pieces and cut them in half lengthwise to yield 6 strips that are roughly 2 inches wide and 8 inches long. Set them aside in a dry spot. Tear the reserved piece of nori into 3/4-inch pieces. Put them in a clean, dry spice grinder (or coffee grinder dedicated to spice grinding) and process into small flakes that resemble graphite. Dont worry if they are not a fine size. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Break up the tofu into 6 to 8 chunks. Working in 2 or 3 batches, put the tofu in a non-terry dishtowel or piece of muslin, then gather it up. Standing over a sink, firmly squeeze and massage. You want some moisture left in the tofu but you dont want it wet. Unwrap and you should have about 11 ounces (roughly 11/3 cups packed). Transfer the tofu to a bowl. Use a potato masher to even out the texture of the tofu. Add the salt, sugar, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and 1 brimming teaspoon of the seaweed flakes; discard or save leftover flakes for another use. Mash the mixture again to create a fairly smooth mixture. Divide the tofu mixture into 6 even portions. In a small bowl, dissolve the remaining 11/2 tablespoons cornstarch with the water. Set this glue and the tofu mixture aside.  To assemble the eel:  Put a nori strip on your work surface, rougher side facing up. Give the cornstarch slurry a stir, then brush it on the seaweed, taking care to cover the edges. Spread a portion of the tofu mixture over the seaweed. Do your best to even out the surface with your fingers, the flat side of the knife blade, or a wooden dowel rolling pin. Now use the spine of the knife to create a faux eel fillet. Lightly tap out shallow lines across the tofu mixture, working from one end to the other. Then, gently press the knife spine down the middle to evoke the backbone. Turn your knife over to its normal position, then halve the strip crosswise. Place the 2 strips on a parchment paperlined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining seaweed strips and tofu mixture. When done, cover loosely with a dishtowel to prevent drying. Heat 1/3 inch of oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat to between 350 and 360F. If you dont have a deep-fry thermometer, gauge the oil temperature by sticking a dry bamboo chopstick into the oil; if bubbles rise immediately to the surface, the oil is ready. Fry the strips 3 at a time, carefully laying each one, tofu side facing down, in the oil. The strip should initially sink, then quickly rise and raucously sizzle. The strip should slightly bend upward, as if it were arching toward you. Oil will naturally pool on the seaweed. Fry for about 2 minutes, until the tofu side is golden, crisp, and puffed up. Use two spatulas to turn the strips over. Fry the nori side for about 45 seconds, until taut and slightly crisp. Drain on paper towel, tofu side up. Return the oil to temperature between batches. The strips are good hot, warm, or at room temperature as long as they are somewhat crisp on the tofu side. To serve, cut each strip crosswise or on a steep diagonal into 3/4- to 1-inch-wide pieces. Arrange on a plate (or put atop a bowl of rice) and spoon or drizzle some of the glaze on top. You can also elect to drizzle the glaze on the strips before cutting and plating them.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sweet-and-savory-tofu-eel-2778", "dishTypes": ["side dish"],

Remove and discard (compost) the stem and seeds.  Place bell peppers cut side up on a steaming rack over an inch of water in a large covered pot.  Bring to boil, let steam for 10 minutes.  3 Heat oven to 350\u00b0F.  In a large bowl mix together the ground beef, basil, summer savory, marjoram, salt, several turns of black pepper, and rice.   4 Remove bell peppers from steamer pan.  Place cut side up in a pyrex or other oven-proof casserole.  Gently stuff the peppers with the ground beef rice mixture.  Drizzle olive oil over the stuffed peppers, along the outside of the peppers, and into the pan.  Rub the oil over the outside of the peppers; it will help with browning.  Sprinkle the tops generously with paprika.5 Place on middle rack and cook for 35-50 minutes, or longer, until the meat is cooked through.Serve with ketchup.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Beat on low until all of the ingredients come together, about 3 minutes, scraping the side of the bowl as needed. Beat on low speed for an additional 3-4 minutes. The dough will be stiff and dry.With the mixer on low speed, add the butter, one piece at a time, only adding the next until the former has been incorporated. Mix on low speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, for 10 minutes. Increase the mixer to medium speed and beat for another 15 minutes. The dough should be sticky, soft, and shiny. Increase the speed to high and beat for 1 minute. Gather up the dough and transfer to a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it down directly onto the surface of the dough. Let proof in the refrigerator overnight.Heat the milk over medium-high heat in a saucepan until small bubbles start to form along the side of the pan. In a separate bowl, stir together the sugar, flour and salt. In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks together, then slowly whisk in the flour/sugar mixture.Slowly add the milk to the egg/sugar/flour mix, whisking constantly. When it has been fully incorporated, add the new mixture to the saucepan and heat over medium, whisking constantly, for 3 minutes or until the mixture thickens and starts to boil. After the mixture starts to boil, whisk it vigorously for 10 seconds, and then remove from the heat. Push the custard through a fine-mesh sieve, into a heatproof bowl. Stir in the vanilla and cover with plastic wrap, placing it directly onto the surface of the cream. Refrigerate overnight.Preheat oven to 350. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.Shape the brioche into a rectangle that is 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. Cut the rectangle into eight squares.Stretch each square into a circle that is about 5 inches in diameter. The inner part of the circle should be pretty thin, while the edges should be thicker. Place onto one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough, placing 4 on each baking sheet.Spread about 2 tbsp of the pastry cream over the base of each brioche circle. Place 3 tbsp of the creme fraiche on top of the pastry cream in each brioche circle, leaving the rim untouched. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle it over the creme fraiche center as well as the rim of each brioche pastry.Bake for 25-30 minutes, switching the pans halfway through baking. The brioche should be golden brown along the edge. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cinnamon-cream-brioche-563201", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,
