mixture resembles coarse crumbs.In another bowl whisk together the yogurt, pumpkin and 1/2 cup of milk.Stir the wet mix into the flour mix until moistened.  Fold in the cranberries, if using.Turn the dough on a floured surface and knead a couple of times.  Greasing your hand lightly with oil/butter will make the kneading easier.Divide the dough into two parts and pat each into an 8-inch circle.  Cut each circle into 8 wedges and place it on an ungreased baking sheet an inch apart and brush the remaining milk over the scones.Bake for about 12-20 minutes.  I\u2019m guessing that it took 20 minutes because I used whole wheat flour (See My Notes).

Set aside.Pop open the refrigerated biscuits and take a paring knife and gently slice the biscuit in half, horizontally. Alternatively, I was able to just split them in half without the paring knife. Just find a seam of where it looks like two layers come together and pull apart.You will get 16 biscuits after you split them in half. Line them on a large cutting board or pastry board.Using 2 cups of the shredded colby jack cheese, sprinkle a heaping pile on top of each biscuit.Take the cubed pieces of ham and place them gently on top of the cheese. If they don't stay on, you can gently press the cheese and ham down on top of the biscuit to make it stay in place. It's ok if some fall off.Make 4 stacks of biscuits by placing 4 biscuit halves on top of each other. Place the stacks in the loaf pan and arranging it so that both ends have biscuit without filling touching the pan (basically, on the very last biscuit halve, you'll have to flip that to face the other filling half so the bare biscuit side will touch the pan).Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.

Lower fish fillets into hot fat, which should come halfway up sides of fish. As soon as crumbs begin to darken, reduce heat a bit. The key is even cooking, so that when you turn the fillets, they are a perfect golden brown.

Turn the fillets; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until golden brown.

Place the garlic, celery, onions and fennel in a food processor and puree to a coarse paste.Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and toss in the pureed veg. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat and season generously with salt and a sprinkey dink of crushed red pepper. Cook the veg until they start to get brown and form a crust on the bottom of the pan; be patient...this will take a little time. Scrape the crud off the bottom of the pan and let it re-form. Stay with it and DO NOT let it burn.Add the ground pork, sprinkle with salt and repeat this process. This takes patience...accept it and move on. THIS is where BIG flavors are formed.When the meat is nice and brown, add in the tomato paste, stir to combine and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the white wine and let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes.Toss in the pureed tomatoes, bay, cinnamon stick, thyme and 2 cups water. Taste and season with salt if needed. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, add more water and reduce again. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. Turn off the heat and use immediately or store for future use.For the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, toss the butternut squash slices with olive oil and salt. Lay the squash slices on sheet trays and bake until the squash is tender but still holds its shape, about 20 minutes. Repeat until all the squash is roasted.Coat a large saute pan with olive oil, toss in 2 of the garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden and very aromatic, remove it and toss it in the \"thank you for coming bowl\". Add half of the mushrooms to the pan, season with salt and cook until they are soft and wilted. Remove from the pan and reserve. Repeat this whole process--starting with the oil and garlic--with the remaining mushrooms, followed by the spinach in 2 batches. Drain and cool the cooked spinach in a colander or mesh strainer.In a large bowl combine the ricotta and parsley.To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a ladleful of the pork ragu in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spread it around to LIGHTLY cover the bottom of the dish.Arrange an even layer of the roasted squash on top of the ragu; be sure the squash completely covers the surface of the baking dish--this acts as the \"pasta\". Cover the squash layer generously with more ragu. Spoon 1-tablespoon scoops of the ricotta mixture over the ragu. Arrange an even layer of spinach and mushrooms over the ricotta.  Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan. Lay another layer of squash over the Parmesan and repeat the process until the baking dish is full, ending with a top layer of squash topped with a little ragu and Parmesan.Cover the baking dish with foil, place on a sheet tray and bake for 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.For the molasses cookies: Put the brown sugar, butter and vegetable shortening in a large bowl and beat with a hand mixer on medium speed until combined. Add the flour, molasses, eggs, cinnamon, ginger and baking soda and beat until combined.Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough onto the baking sheets. Make sure there is ample space between each dough ball as the cookies will spread.Bake until puffed on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet on a rack for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely before frosting.For the boiled frosting: Combine the granulated sugar, 3/4 cup water, cream of tartar and a pinch of salt in a medium heavy-bottomed pot, bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until a candy thermometer registers 245 degrees, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and fold in the marshmallows until melted.Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip on medium-high speed into stiff peaks.

a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add the grits and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the Cheddar, 3 tablespoons of the butter and the heavy cream, and keep warm.While the grits cook, prepare the rest of the dish. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add the tasso ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to crisp, about 8 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the cracked pepper. Using a slotted spoon, remove the ham to a paper-towel-lined plate. In the same skillet set over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the shrimp. Cook, turning once, until bright pink, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a plate.In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium, then add the bell peppers, garlic, jalapenos and onions, and cook until the vegetables just starting to brown. Add the tomatoes and cook until they start to break down. Increase the heat to high, then add the stock and Creole seasoning. Scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Cook until the stock reduces by half, 3 minutes. Return the shrimp and ham to the skillet along with the lemon juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Divide the grits among four bowls and top each with some shrimp and sauce.

Pulse until the mushrooms resemble couscous, about 10 pulses. Place minced mushroom in a large bowl. Place the quartered onions in the food process and pulse until minced. Add  cup of the minced onions to the mushrooms and set the remaining onions aside for the sauce. There should be about  cup of onions left.Using your hands, mix the beef, garlic, cilantro, paprika, salt, and black pepper into the mushroom and onions. Roll into 1-inch balls. A 1-tablespoon cookie scoop speeds up this process and makes for uniform meatballs. You should have about 40 meatballs.Heat a deep 12-inch skillet over medium-high. Working in batches so you dont overcrowd the pan, brown the meatballs. Set the meatballs aside. Do not wipe pan out. The browned bits add flavour to the sauce.Melt the butter in the meatball skillet over medium heat. Add the coriander, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, black pepper and chili flakes, if using. Fry for a 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add the onion, ginger and garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Gently add the meatballs back into the pan. Add enough water to cover the meatballs by , about 1 cup. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook with lid partially on for 40 minutes.

Add the sugar, oil, egg whites, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.                                                                                            Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning once to coat the top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Combine the flour, granulated sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut in the lard with 2 knives until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of lard (do not overmix). A little at a time, stir in 1/2 to 1 cup ice water until the dough holds together when squeezed; the amount of water will vary depending on the humidity. (You can also make the dough in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.) Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form each half into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.Make the filling: Combine the apples, flour, turbinado sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, lemon juice, green chiles and pine nuts in a large bowl and toss. Let sit 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate, then spoon the filling into the crust. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round; lay the dough over the filling. Press the 2 crusts together around the edge, then fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Cut a few slits in the top crust or prick with a fork to let steam escape. Whisk the egg with 1/4 cup water and brush over the top crust. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Bake, rotating the pie every 20 minutes, until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Serve with ice cream.Photograph by Devon Jarvis                                                    Recipe courtesy of Michael Rawl for Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

The dough will still be sticky. (See Kelly's Notes.)Cut a large X in the top of the round and place the loaf of a baking sheet. Dust it with 1 teaspoon of flour and bake it for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.Transfer the loaf to a rack and cool it completely before cutting it into slices. (See Kelly's Notes.)When ready to assemble the grilled cheese, spread 4 slices of the soda bread with the prepared basil pesto, and then add a few slices of the Irish cheddar. Form sandwiches by topping off each slathered side with a second piece of bread, and then butter both exterior sides of the bread. (See Kelly's Notes.)Heat a skillet over medium heat and transfer the prepared sandwiches to the pan, searing them just until golden on one side. Flip the sandwiches once to brown the second side and continue melting the cheese. If necessary, cover the pan to ensure the cheese will melt. Cut the grilled cheese and serve warm. Kelly's Notes:Every time I make this bread I find it gets better and better with the less you knead it. Many soda breads are often not kneaded at all prior to baking.The loaf will provide more than 8 slices of bread, but I like to use the leftovers to make homemade soda bread croutons, which I toss with a bit of olive oil and fresh garlic.I've become a bit of a grilled cheese connoisseur over the years and have found that you get much more even browning if you butter the bread first, rather than place the prepared sandwiches in a pan of melted butter.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/irish-soda-bread-grilled-cheese-with-pesto-515949", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lifes Ambrosia", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sausage--Apple-and-Brie-Stuffing-568178.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 50, "id": 568178, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sausage, Apple and Brie Stuffing", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Lifes Ambrosia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 ounces brie cheese rind removed, diced", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "brie cheese", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brie.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1006, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 - 2 cups chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon fennel", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fennel", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fennel.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11957, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 cups chopped granny smith apples (about 2 apples peeled and cored)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "granny smith apples", "metaInformation": ["cored", "peeled", "chopped", "( 2 apples and )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grannysmith-apples.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1029003, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2025, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pound ground country pork sausage", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "ground pork sausage", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 7063, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "6 cups cubed rustic day old bread", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "rustic bread", "metaInformation": ["cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/italian-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 10028033, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "yellow onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "yellow", "medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10511282, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 52.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2012/11/sausage-apple-and-brie-stuffing-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 33, "aggregateLikes": 38, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
