Stir well before proceeding.Assemble8. In a small bowl mix together the egg white and water. Set aside.9. Cut out a piece of parchment paper about 16 inches long, and place it on your work surface. Lightly flour the parchment and roll out the dough to a 15-inch round. Transfer the dough and parchment to a baking pan or sheet. Don\u2019t worry if the dough is a little larger than your pan because you will be folding in the sides of the dough to make a 13-inch round.10. Arrange the apple slices and cranberries on the dough leaving a 2-inch border. Gently fold the 2-inch border of the Galette toward the center to encase part of the filling, crimping the edges a little as you go. (Repair any gaps or cracks so that the galette won\u2019t leak while baking). You should end up with a \u201cwindow\u201d of filling about 9 inches in diameter, with the crust overlapping the edges of the filling.11. Pour 2 tablespoons of the apple juices over the apples. Brush the folded-over edges with the egg white mixture. Sprinkle the crust with 1 tablespoon sanding sugar.12. Bake until the border is golden and the apples are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for about 20 minutes.13. Just before serving, whip the cream with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Serve the galette warm or at room temperature with a dollop of the sweetened whipped cream.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mimolette-cheese-and-apple-cranberry-galette-599038", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "french"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/classic-french-mussels-738888.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 738888, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Classic French Mussels", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 404.67, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Crusty bread, to serve", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "crusty bread", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/country-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10018029, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 cup dry white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14106, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh parsley", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "bunchs", "unitShort": "bunch", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11297, "unit": "bunch"}, {"originalString": "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 pounds mussels, cleaned", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "mussels", "metaInformation": ["cleaned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mussels.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 15164, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 shallots, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shallots", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11677, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "cut into pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 92.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/classic-french-mussels-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 34, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "id": 4053, "name": "olive oil"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add the shallots and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "id": 11677, "name": "shallot"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "id": 11215, "name": "garlic"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Add the mussels, wine, cream, butter, and parsley and season well with salt.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the bread, 1 teaspoon rosemary, the red pepper flakes and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bread is golden brown, about 10 minutes; transfer to a bowl.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and blot dry with paper towels. (You can refrigerate the green beans, covered, for up to 4 hours; keep the bread mixture at room temperature.)Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and the garlic in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the garlic is lightly golden, about 3 minutes, adding the remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary during the last 30 seconds. Add the green beans and lemon zest; cook, stirring, until coated. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the bread mixture.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine
