Store and serve at room temperature.TIP: For light tender cupcakes, spoon flour and cocoa lightly into measuring cups (instead of dipping the cups into the flour or cocoa) and then sweep the measures level without tapping or shaking them.To make vanilla swiss meringue frosting:Combine egg whites and sugar in a bowl placed over simmering water. Bring mixture to 160 degrees F while whisking constantly.Transfer mixture to stand mixer bowl fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on medium speed until mixture becomes foamy, then increase speed to high and beat until it cools and doubles in volume.Add butter in one piece at a time, mixing to incorporate after each addition.The mixture may appear clumpy and almost curdled looking-this isnormal. Keep mixing and it willbecome evenand smooth again.Add salt and vanilla and mix to combine.Portion out a 1/3 of the frosting tint for the roses.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/rose-cupcakes-541572", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Law Students Wife", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Double-Crust-Cherry-Crisp-605941.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 605941, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Double Crust Cherry Crisp", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 209.95, "creditText": "The Law Students Wife", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/3 cup all purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "all purpose flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar (light or dark)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["dark", "light", "packed", "( or )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1082047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup rolled oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "rolled oats", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 cups pitted sweet cherries such as Bing, pitted (about 3 1/4 pounds);

Spread the olive mixture over the center of the dough lengthwise, covering the center 4 inches, and leaving 1 1/2 inches at each end. Layer the salami, then the provolone on top of the olive mixture down the center of the dough. Spread the sun-dried tomatoes on top, then layer the ham and mozzarella on top of the tomatoes. Finish by laying down a line of the fresh basil leaves over the filling ingredients.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 To form the braid, starting 1 1/2 inches from the filling, make parallel horizontal cuts in the dough at 1 1/2 inch intervals down both sides, leaving a 1 1/2 inch border at the top and bottom. Fold the top and bottom edges over the filling, and starting at the top fold one strip over the filling from the right side, then the left, slightly overlapping each. Continue alternating strips to create a braided effect, tucking in the end strips as needed. Cover with a kitchen towel, and allow the Stromboli to rise 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water and lightly brush the tops and sides of the Stromboli, then sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Bake until golden brown, for 25 to 30 minutes.
