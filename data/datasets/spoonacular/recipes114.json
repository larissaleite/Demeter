In a large bowl, combine turkey, black beans, both cheeses, salsa, cilantro, and cumin. Mix well to combine.  Unroll pie crusts onto a flat surface. Using 4-inch cutter, cut out 6 circles. Divide turkey mixture into equal portions and place each portion (in mounds) on top of the pie crusts. Fold over and pinch the edges together to seal. Using a fork, make hash marks on the edges of the empanadas to ensure they are sealed. Transfer empanadas to a large baking sheet. Using a sharp knife, make small slits in the top of each empanada to allow steam to escape during cooking. Brush with egg wash and place into preheated oven. Bake for 15 minutes, until crust is golden brown.

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all butenough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan(do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes). 3 Saut onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a largebowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk.Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stirin the grated cheddar cheese.6 Preheat oven to 350F.7Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables:Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives. (Be gentle as to not break up the bread.)8Assemble the casserole:Generously butter the inside of a 2 1/2 to 3 quart (8 x 13 inch) casserole dish. Gently pour the bread egg milk vegetable mixture into the casserole dish and spread out in an even layer.At this point you can make up to a day ahead. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.9Bake:Bake uncovered at 350F for 4o minutes. If the casserole starts to get too browned while cooking, cover with foil. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/asparagus-artichoke-breakfast-casserole-724019", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 65, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Kitchn", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/pork_sinigang_soup-9986.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 9986, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Pork Sinigang Soup", "creditText": "The Kitchn", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 cups of baby bok choy, halved", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "baby bok choy", "metaInformation": ["halved"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bok-choy.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 93636, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 carrot, peeled and cut in chunks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrot", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "cut in chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup daikon radish, sliced (optional)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "daikon radish", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/daikon.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11430, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup of small dried shrimp", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "dried shrimp", "metaInformation": ["dried", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp-dried.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10093657, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp. fish sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "fish sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asian-fish-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6179, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1 medium onion, quartered and sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["medium", "sliced", "quartered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 lbs. pork ribs, cut in 1-inch chunks.

Add the onion, garlic, and chiles, and season with salt. Saut for about 10 minutes, adding water to the pan (as much as 1 cup total), stirring often to prevent the vegetables browning. Add the chard leaves, season with salt, and fold the leaves in with the onion for 1 or 2 minutes to wilt them slightly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the chard leaves are very dark green and the onion, leaves and stems are one soft, homogenous mixture. Turn the vegetables out onto a cutting board, finely chop and set aside.  For the sausage:  Thoroughly combine all ingredients in a very large mixing bowl using your hands. Cover until ready to use and freeze the remainder in sturdy freezer bags.  For the sauce:  Heat a saut pan over high heat until its very hot. Add the sausage to the pan and cook it undisturbed for about 2 minutes, until the meat is seared. Stir the meat and cook for another 4 minutes, breaking it into pea-sized pieces, until it is cooked through. Add the chopped chard and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to warm it through, stirring the chard into the sausage as it cooks. Sprinkle the pepper over the chard and sausage, add the chicken stock, and cook the sauce for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to bring the ingredients together. Add the butter, stir until it melts, and turn off the heat while you cook the pasta.  For the pasta:  Fill a pasta pot or large stockpot with 6 quarts of water, add 6 tablespoons of salt, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. If you are not using a pasta pot, place a colander in the sink or have a large wire strainer handy to lift the pasta out of the pot. Remove the orecchiette from the refrigerator or the freezer and drop them into the boiling water. Stir to prevent the pasta from sticking together, partially cover the pot so the water returns to a boil quickly and continues boiling, and cook the pasta until its al dente, about 2 minutes. Alternately, use dried pasta and cook according to directions. About 1 minute before the pasta is done, place the sauce over high heat. Lift the pasta out of the cooking water or drain it and immediately add it to the pan with the sauce. Cook the pasta with the sauce together for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring with a rubber spatula, until the sauce is thick, adding fresh water to the pan if the pasta looks dry or sticky instead of slippery and glistening. Turn off the heat and add the finishing-quality olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano and fennel pollen, stirring vigorously and shaking the pan to emulsify the sauce.  Pile the orecchiette in the center of each of eight plates, dividing it evenly, and spoon any sauce left in the pan over the pasta. Sprinkle a generous spoon of bread crumbs over each serving, and serve with the remaining bread crumbs on the side.

large bowl, mix dry ingredients.Add water and oil and stir until the dough comes together. If the dough stays a little dry, you may need to add additional water, by the tablespoon until all the flour has been incorporated.Knead dough on a lightly floured counter top until smooth, 5-7 minutes.Place in a greased bowl in a warm place, and cover until you are ready to roll out the crust.(This can be done up to a day ahead of time. Simply refrigerate the crust and remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to roll it out.)Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.(The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated up to a week before using.)Pre-heat oven to 400F.On a lightly floured surface, roll your crust into an 18 inch diameter circle. Transfer rolled dough onto a piece of greased aluminum foil the size of your baking sheet. (It is ok if the dough hangs over the sides of the foil, this is just to make transferring the calzone to the pan easier.)Dividing your dough into thirds, cut 1 \u2013 1 \u00bd inch thick strips towards the center from the two sides, leaving a 6\u201d wide un-cut band down the center of the crust.Spread your sauce over the center section, leaving 2 inches at the top and bottom un-sauced.Sprinkle your toppings on the pizza sauce, leaving a 1 inch band roughly \u00bc of the way down from the top free of toppings. This will be your eye slit.To wrap the mummy, fold the un-sauced bottom up over the toppings. Begin folding each strip over the toppings, alternating sides, and brushing each strip with milk-wash before laying another strip down. (The milk will help the strips stick together and make the crust nice and golden brown.)As you continue from the toes up the mummy, stop when you reach the eye-slit area that you left free of toppings.

"aggregateLikes": 179, "instructions": "In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the buttermilk, grated ginger, rum and vanilla extract together. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture has a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Then stir in the molasses. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the buttermilk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners. Fill about  full, using about  cup of batter per cup. Tip: Avoid over-filling the liners which may cause the batter to run-over the sides when baking. It is better to bake any remaining batter separately after the first pan of cupcakes has finished baking.Bake: Bake, rotating pan halfway through, 20 to 22 minutes, or until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and a toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly in cupcake pan, and turn out of pan when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a wire cooling rack before frosting.In a medium heavy saucepan, add the flour, and using a wire whisk, slowly whisk in the milk, whisking until the sauce is smooth and free of lumps. Place the pan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Boil and whisk for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature, or a tepid temperature. While cooling, whisk frequently to keep the sauce smooth. Tip: If the sauce is too warm when added to the creamed butter mixture it will melt the butter. If the sauce is too cold it will not blend smoothly.Meanwhile, prepare the butter and sugar when the sauce is almost cooled to the right temperature. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.Gradually add the cooled sauce, adding 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, beating about 20 seconds between each addition. Add the vanilla and continue to beat for another 1 to 2 minutes to thoroughly blend and the frosting in somewhat fluffy. The frosting should be used immediately, or refrigerate until needed.Use a small offset spatula to frost the top of each cupcake, or use a pastry bag and decorating tip to pipe the frosting.Sprinkle white edible glitter on top of frosted cupcakes. Top with a small gingerbread cookie (optional.) Tip: Add the gingerbread cookie just before serving; the moisture from the cupcakes and frosting will make the cookies soft and the cookies will start to droop if added too far in advance.In a medium bowl, stir together powdered sugar, corn syrup, vanilla. Add warm milk in small quantities, start with 2 tablespoons of milk, then when its getting close to the right consistency add milk in teaspoonfuls or just drops of milk at a time, until it is the desired consistency; for piping, the icing should be like a thick sour cream.When the glaze is the right consistency, spoon into a small plastic freezer bag. Put a little piece of tape on corner to reinforce the tip, and then roll over top of bag to keep neater. (You could also use a plastic squeeze bottle with a tip available in decorating stores), Twist the top of the bag to create some pressure to make easier to squeeze out. Cut a tiny corner off the tip of the bag.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gingerbread-cupcakes-672185", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 142, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Beantown Baker", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Ultimate-Whoopie-Pies-509887.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 509887, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "The Ultimate Whoopie Pies", "creditText": "Beantown Baker", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "salted caramel sauce (homemade or store bought)", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "caramel sauce", "metaInformation": ["salted", "homemade", "store bought", "( or )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sauce-caramel.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 18.0, "id": 19364, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 batch chocolate cupcake batter", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "chocolate cupcake", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/plain-cupcake.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18139, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp cream of tartar", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cream of tartar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18373, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "8 egg whites", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 batch marshmallow frosting (recipe below)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "frosting", "metaInformation": ["(recipe below)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/frosting-or-icing.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19230, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cups sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 tsp vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 9.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.beantownbaker.com/2012/01/ultimate-whoopie-pies.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 2183, "instructions": "For the Marshmallow FrostingPlace egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer.

Prepare Pumpkinseed Filling: Heat a large skillet to medium-heat. Add pumpkin seeds and cook, stirring and shaking the pan, until fragrant and slightly golden, about 4 minutes.

Add garlic & saut\u00e9 until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in jalape\u00f1os and cook another minute or so. Stir in the chicken broth, turn heat to medium, and cook simmer until the liquid is slightly reduced and the chilies soften. Scrape mixture into food processor; add cooled pumpkin seeds in there too. Process until the mixture is a coarse but spreadable paste. Scoop into a bowl and let cool while you prepare the sauce. Wipe out food processor with paper towels so it's ready to use for the sauce.3. Prepare Sauce: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add leeks and saut\u00e9 until soft, about 3 minutes. Add squash and chicken broth, increase heat to high, and to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until squash is tender (10 to 15 minutes). Transfer to food processor. Add cumin, salt and cream. Puree until the sauce is completely smooth. Return to skillet. If the sauce seems too thick, thin it out a little bit with additional chicken broth.4. Prepare Chicken: Lay each breast flat between two pieces of waxed paper. Pound until about 1/4-inch-thick. Spread 1/4 of the pumpkinseed pesto across each breast. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cheese over the filling. Fold each breast in half to create a pocket.5. Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Place flour in a shallow bowl and carefully dredge each chicken pocket in the flour. Add to the pan, one by one. Cook until pink is gone, about 5 minutes on each side.

In a separate bowl, combine all liquid ingredients for the cookies. Mix wet into dry to form a dough, then refrigerate 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Put dough in a plastic bag, and smush into one big ball. Remove from bag, roll into a thin dough, and cut flat circles using a circle cutter or a circle-shaped lid. Bake on a greased cookie tray for 10 minutes; theyll still look a little underdone when they come out of the oven, but thats ok. Important: allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from the tray.</p><p>To make the filling, mix all filling ingredients in a small food processor (or patiently, with a fork).

Have hot water ready to go for the water bath when it is time to bake the custards.In a medium sauce pan pour in all of the heavy cream. Split the vanilla beans and scrape out the seeds into the cream. Whisk to disperse the seeds. Add the beans and set the heat to medium. Heat until steaming, being careful not to let it boil. Once hot, cover and let steep for 20 minutes.Preheat oven to 325 deg F.In a separate bowl combine the egg yolks, sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Mix well until thick and pale and when you lift the beater a ribbon of mixture pours back into the bowl. When the cream has steeped for 20 minutes, strain it into another bowl or large mixing cup. Rinse and reserve the vanilla beans for another use. Start to whisk the eggs slowly and add the warmed cream mixture a little at a time to temper the eggs, warming them up being careful not to scramble them. Keep the cream pouring in a thin stream as you whisk, being careful not to incorporate too many bubbles or cause the mixture to foam up. You can strain again at this point to make sure none of the egg scrambled during the tempering.Divide the mixture amongst the ramekins in the baking pans. Pour hot water into the pan, making sure it reaches to about halfway up the ramekins. The water needs to be hot to ensure even cookingPlace pans carefully in the oven, making sure no water splashes into the custards. Bake for 30-35 minutes. The custards will set on top but still be a little loose, they will set fully once cooled. Remove from the oven and remove the ramekins from the water bath to a cooling rack to cool completely. Chill at least 4 hours or overnight.When ready to serve, bring the custards to room temperature. Spoon 1-2 tbsp granulated sugar over the top (you don\u2019t want too much, but you don\u2019t want too little either).

For the dough: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together 2 cups of flour, lemon zest, orange zest, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the eggs, wine, and vanilla. Pulse until the mixture forms into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Cut the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough until 1/4-inch thick. Cut each piece of dough into 1/2-inch wide strips. Cut each strip of pastry into 1/2-inch pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a small ball about the size of a hazelnut. Lightly dredge the dough balls in flour, shaking off any excess. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don't have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.). In batches, fry the dough until lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. (The rested and quartered dough can also be rolled on a floured work surface into 1/2-inch thick logs and cut into equal-sized 1/2-inch pieces. The dough pieces can then be rolled into small balls and fried as above).In a large saucepan, combine the honey, sugar, and lemon juice over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the fried dough and hazelnuts and stir until coated in the honey mixture. Allow the mixture to cool in the pan for 2 minutes.Spray the outside of a small, straight-sided water glass with vegetable oil cooking spray and place in the center of a round platter. Using a large spoon or damp hands, arrange the struffoli and hazelnuts around the glass to form a wreath shape. Drizzle any remaining honey mixture over the struffoli. Allow to set for 2 hours (can be made 1 day in advance). Decorate with sprinkles and dust with powdered sugar, if using. Remove the glass from the center of the platter and serve.Cook's Note: To toast the hazelnuts, arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.

Stir together the half-and-half and 2 cups of the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Split the vanilla bean, scrape out the caviar and add it to the mixture (or add the vanilla extract). Heat the mixture until it's hot but not simmering or boiling.In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks vigorously with a whisk until they start to lighten in color, about 2 minutes.Next, grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and very slowly drizzle it into the bowl with the egg yolks, whisking the whole time. (The purpose of this is to temper the egg yolks and bring them to a good temperature before adding them to the pan.) Repeat with a second ladle of hot half-and-half mixture, making sure to whisk the whole time.Pour the tempered yolks into the saucepan with the rest of the half-and-half mixture and stir gently with a wooden spoon, cooking it slowly, until it's thick enough to coat the spoon, 2 to 4 minutes.Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean bowl. Pour the thick half-and-half liquid through the strainer into the bowl. Add the heavy cream and stir gently to combine. Refrigerate this mixture until chilled, about 2 hours.Meanwhile, combine the strawberries and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a blender. Puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the chilled custard mixture and stir.Now pour this mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze it according to the manufacturer's directions. Depending on the size of your machine, you may need to do this in 2 batches. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer until frozen firm, at least 4 hours.

Make the Dough: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, stir together yeast and milk; let stand until yeast is dissolved, about 1 minute. Add the flour, sugar, salt and eggs; mix on low speed until the dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, two pieces at a time, mixing after each addition and until butter is fully incorporated and dough is soft, a total of 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 6 hours and up to 15 hours.2. Make the Pastry Cream: While the dough is chilling, make the pastry cream. In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks until well combined, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in the flour mixture until thick and pasty. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the milk until bubbles just start to form around the edges (do not let the milk boil).3. Remove the milk from the heat and slowly drizzle into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Scrape the egg mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 3 minutes. Boil, whisking, for 10 seconds (the cream will become thick and glossy and won't have any foam on top), then immediately remove from heat.4. Pour the pastry cream through a fine mesh sieve set over a small bowl and whisk in the vanilla. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap against the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.5. Prepare the Doughnuts: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray lightly with non-stick cooking spray; set aside. Place the refrigerated dough on a well-floured work surface and gently roll into a 12-inch square (it should be about \u00bd-inch thick). Cut the dough into 9 doughnuts using a 3\u00bd-inch round cutter. Transfer the doughnuts to the prepared baking sheet, cover with a piece of plastic wrap that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, and place in a warm spot until they've doubled in height and feel poufy and pillowy, 2 to 3 hours. 6. Fry the Doughnuts: Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with 3 inches of oil and place over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. While the oil heats, line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels for draining the doughnuts. Place the sugar in a small bowl and set aside.7. Working with three doughnuts at a time, carefully lower the doughnuts into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on the underside, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the doughnuts over and fry for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown as well. Using a slotted spoon or a spider strainer, remove the doughnuts to the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts.8. As soon as the doughnuts are cool enough to handle, toss them in the sugar one at a time to evenly coat them. Return the doughnuts to the paper towel-lined pan and allow to cool completely, 30 to 40 minutes.9. Fill the Doughnuts: While you're waiting for the doughnuts to cool, beat the 6 tablespoons of heavy cream on medium-high speed until still peaks form. Whisk the chilled pastry cream to loosen it up, then gently fold in one-third of the whipped cream. Fold in the remaining whipped cream until no white streaks remain.10. Transfer the cream to a pastry bag fitting with a small round decorating tip (a Wilton #12 would work well for this). Poke a hole in the side of each doughnut and fill with pastry cream. The doughnuts should be served as soon as they are filled. They are best the same day they are made.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/vanilla-cream-filled-doughnuts-507693", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 720, "servings": 9, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Nutritious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Perfect-Snack--Oatmeal-Peanut-Butter-Balls-559034.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 559034, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "The Perfect Snack- Oatmeal Peanut Butter Balls", "creditText": "Nutritious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 full graham crackers, finely crushed", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "graham crackers", "metaInformation": ["crushed", "finely"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18617, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup pure maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19911, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup peanut butter (I use 1/3 cup creamy and 1/3 cup chunky)", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["(I use 1/3 cup creamy and 1/3 cup chunky)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 16098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup quick cooking oats, uncooked", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "quick cooking oats", "metaInformation": ["uncooked", "quick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 8402, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 71.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.nutritiouseats.com/the-perfect-snack-oatmeal-peanut-butter-balls/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 6031, "instructions": "Combine all ingredients in a medium sized bowl.

Beat in vanilla.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Scrape the bowl down between each egg addition to ensure that everything is properly mixed. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            In another small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and milk. It may be a bit lumpy. That\u2019s okay. On low speed, add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the batter. As it incorporates, add half of the sour cream mixture. Add another 1/3 of the flour mixture and the remainder of the sour cream mixture. Mix until barely incorporated and add the remaining flour. Finish incorporating the dry ingredients with a spatula to ensure that all of the flour is well incorporated.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Spread about half of the batter into the prepared pan, pushing it to the edges with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle the filling on top of the batter.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Dollop the remaining batter across the top of the filling and use a spatula to spread batter across pan. Use a butter knife to gently swirl the filling into the batter with a few gentle strokes.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Sprinkle the topping evenly over the batter and bake the cake until is golden brown and a cake tester or wooden skewer inserted into center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.
