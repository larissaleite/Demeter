Toss them into a colander as you go, sprinkling them generous with salt. When you're all done. let them sit in the colander for a good 30 minutes or more.Now set yourself up with lots of paper towels at the ready, and another colander or bowl. Take whole handfuls of the salted eggplant, lay it on a paper towel, then wrap up the eggplant chunks and gently squeeze to dry them as completely as possible. Drop the dried eggplant into the second colander. Repeat this procedure until you have used up all the eggplant.Fry the eggplant chunks in abundant oil until they are just lightly brown around the edges. The eggplant should be tender, but not meltingly so. Lay the fried eggplant out on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.While the eggplant is purging per Step 2 above, cut the tomatoes into rough chunks, about the same size as the eggplant. Heat some olive oil in a skillet wide enough to hold them all in a single layer and toss in the garlic cloves. When the garlic is just beginning to give off its aroma (no more than a few moments) add the tomatoes and saut\u00e9 them over a very brisk flame until they have cooked down. They will have melted into a kind of sauce, but with some chunkiness left in them. If you've made the tomato ahead of time, you can just let it rest off heat until you're need it.Add the eggplant to the tomatoes in the skillet. Mix everything together very gingerly to avoid turning the eggplant (which should be quite tender) into mush. If you have the skill, the best way is to toss the ingredients around in the skillet. If you're not up to that, then a spatula will do a more delicate job than a wooden spoon. Let the eggplant and tomatoes saut\u00e9 over very brisk heat, tossing them from time to time, almost as if you were doing an Asian stir-fry, for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.

Place the tomatoes in a heavy, wide, nonreactive pan of at least an 8-quart capacity. Cover, place the pan over high heat, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring every minute or so, until the tomato chunks spill their juice and everything comes to a boil.2. Working in batches, pour the tomato chunks and juice into a large, medium-fine strainer placed over a 3- or 4-quart saucepan. Gently press and stir the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon so that all of the thin liquid but none of the tomato pulp goes into the saucepan. You should have about 2 quarts of liquid. Reserve the tomato pulp.3. To the tomato liquid in the saucepan add the garlic, onion, vinegar, peppercorns, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne, ginger, and salt. Cook over moderately high heat until the liquid is thick and syrupy and reduced to about 2 cups. This could take anywhere from half an hour to an hour or even as long as 2 hours or, in the case of 1 tester, up to 4 hours, depending on the type of tomato used. [Editor's Note: Some tomatoes, such as beefsteaks, are more pulpy and mealy, whereas other tomatoes, like Romas, are more juicy. This will affect the final yield of juice and total simmering time.]4. Meanwhile, transfer the tomato pulp to a food mill fitted with the finest screen to eliminate the seeds and skin. You should have about 1 quart strained pulp. Transfer the strained pulp back to the first pan and reserve the tomato solids that you strained from the tomato pulp.5. Strain the thick, syrupy, reduced tomato liquid into the tomato pulp, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid. Stir in the sugar and gently simmer over medium-low or low heat, stirring frequently, until the ketchup is reduced by 1/3, 15 to 20 minutes Taste the ketchup occasionally, adding more sugar if desired. You should have about 4 cups tomato goo at the end. If the ketchup still seems a little runny, continue to simmer the mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the desired consistency is attained. If the ketchup isn\u2019t quite the texture of commercial ketchup and some very vocal dissenters in your household prefer that, pur\u00e9e the ketchup in a blender or food processor. Let the ketchup cool to room temperature. Transfer the ketchup to glass jars or other containers with tight-fitting lids and refrigerate for up to several weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/because-i-can-homemade-ketchup-598036", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Boulder Locavore", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Blueberry-Mango-Mixed-Greens-Salad-with-Blueberry-Guava-Vinaigrette-522127.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 522127, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Blueberry-Mango Mixed Greens Salad with Blueberry-Guava Vinaigrette", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Boulder Locavore", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup sliced Almonds", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "almonds", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12061, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons Balsamic Vinager", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "balsamic glaze", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 98998, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup fresh Blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9050, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cups fresh Blueberries, rinsed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "rinsed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9050, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1034053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup Feta Cheese crumbles", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1019, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup Guava Juice", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "guava juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/guava-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93678, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Small pinch Kosher Salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup fresh Mango, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mango", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "cut into \u00bd-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mango.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9176, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups organic mixed Greens", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mixed greens", "metaInformation": ["mixed", "organic"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-greens-or-mesclun.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 21052, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 68.0, "sourceUrl": "http://boulderlocavore.com/2014/06/blueberry-mango-mixed-greens-salad-with-blueberry-guava-vinaigrette.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 215, "instructions": "Place all ingredients in a blender; puree until fully combined.

Add the egg and vanilla and mix to combine. Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt, and mix together until the dough comes together. Place plastic wrap on the surface of the dough and refrigerate for 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line baking sheets with baking mats or parchment.Roll out the cookie dough and cut out the cookies using a rectangular cookie cutter, re-rolling the scraps in order to use as much of the dough as possible. Place the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, in batches if necessary, being careful not to burn. Cookies will remain the same general size and shape after they bake.Remove from the oven and place the cookies on a cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely.Melt the almond barks in separate bowls in the microwave. Dip half of each cookie into the white almond bark and half into the chocolate bark. Immediately sprinkle or press toppings from the Dipping Bar over both sides of the cookies. Gently set on parchment paper or another nonstick surface and allow to cool before serving.                                                    2011 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved

Blend until smooth. Place the pork chops in a large gallon re-sealable bag and pour the marinade over the meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, but I would suggest overnight to lock in the flavors. On a hot grill lay pork chops in a single layer.  When richly browned, usually just about 3 to 4 minutes, flip and brown the other side.As the meat is done, transfer it to a cutting board and chop it up (between 1/4 and 1/2-inch pieces). Scoop into a skillet and place on a warm grill keeping the meat warm.  Roasted Pineapple Salsa:Cut a pineapple into rings. Lightly brush both sides of the pineapple rings with vegetable oil. Grill turning once, until lightly charred, about 3 minutes per side.Chop it up and mix with red onion, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt and pepper.Add the salsa to the pork and toss everything together.

Set aside.Combine 1  1/2 cups of the pecans with the bread crumbs and  1/4 cup of the parsley on a large plate.Open up and cut the trout, diagonally, into two fillets. Season both the flesh and skin sides with salt and pepper to taste, and then, working with one at a time, press the flesh side of the trout into the pecan mixture to make a thin coating.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Using a tablespoon of the peanut oil, generously grease a baking sheet. Set aside.Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan over high heat. When very hot but not smoking, add 6 trout fillets and sear to set the crust. Turn and sear the other side. Using a fish spatula or a large, wide spatula, transfer the trout to the prepared baking sheet. Add additional oil to the pan and continue to sear the remaining trout. When seared, transfer to the prepared baking sheet.Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the trout for about 7 minutes or until cooked through. While the trout is baking, melt the butter in a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Watching carefully and lowering the heat if necessary, allow the butter to foam and turn golden brown. Immediately add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. While the butter is still foaming, add the remaining pecans and parsley. Do not allow the butter to burn or it will be unusable.Place 2 fillets on each of 6 dinner plates and pour the Parsley Brown Butter over the top. Sprinkle with reserved lemon zest and serve.  NOTE: A nice assortment of spring or baby vegetables can be served as an optional garnish.

Prepare 16 cupcake liners on a baking tray.  Alternatively, set the liners inside muffin tins.

Use the paddle attachment to beat the butter and sugar together until light, fluffy, and the sugar is completely dissolved.  Scrape down the bowl with a spatula, as required during the mixing process.  Add the eggs and mix on low speed until combined.Sift together the flour and baking powder.  Add half the flour mixture to the batter.  Beat until smooth.Add the orange juice and beat on low speed until combined.  Finally, add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the batter is light, creamy and smooth.Divide the batter between the prepared cupcake liners.  Bake for 15 - 18 minutes until risen, golden and the tops spring back when touched.Remove from the oven and cool the cupcakes on a wire rack.While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare the Orange Cream.Place the cream in a mixing bowl.  Sift the icing sugar to remove any lumps.  Add the sugar to the cream and mix on low speed until fully incorporated and the cream thickens slightly.Add the orange juice, and the Triple Sec, if using.Mix on low speed until the cream is light and thickened.Take care not to overbeat as you don't want the cream to be too stiff and on the verge of separating.  It should hold its shape when piped.Fill a piping bag, fitted with a plain or decorative tip, halfway with the cream.Pipe the cream onto the cupcakes and had some cream leftover.I only pipe a small amount but be as generous or restrained as you please.If you have any leftover cream, it will make a wonderful topping for pancakes, oats, fruit, gelato, desserts, or just grab a spoon.The cupcakes will keep, without the cream frosting, for several days, stored in an airtight container at room temperature.Once frosted, store the cupcakes in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for several days.Let the cupcakes come to room temperature before serving, for the best flavour.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/orange-cream-cupcakes-610314", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Desserts with Benefits", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthy-Peanut-Butter-Apple-Yogurt-Dip-(sugar-free--low-carb--low-fat---high-protein)-608402.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 608402, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Healthy Peanut Butter Apple Yogurt Dip (sugar free, low carb, low fat & high protein)", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Desserts with Benefits", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "almond milk", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93607, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup Unsweetened Applesauce", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "applesauce", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/applesauce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9019, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup Plain, Nonfat Greek Yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "nonfat greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["plain"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "120g (1 cup) Peanut Flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "peanut flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpea-flour-or-another-gluten-free-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16100, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/8 tsp Pink Himalayan Salt", "aisle": "Gourmet", "name": "pink himalayan salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/himalayan-pink-salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 1032047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp Stevia Extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "stevia extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/stevia.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93628, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 93.0, "sourceUrl": "http://dessertswithbenefits.com/healthy-peanut-butter-apple-yogurt-dip/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 237, "instructions": "In a blender or food processor, add the yogurt, applesauce, almond milk and stevia.

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw three 10 x 4 1/2-inch rectangles on parchment; turn parchment over. Finely grind 1 cup nuts with 1/4 cup sugar in processor. Coarsely chop remaining 1/4 cup nuts and set aside.                                                                            Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and coarse salt in large bowl until foamy. With mixer running, gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating until meringue is stiff and glossy. Add ground nut mixture and coarsely chopped nuts; fold gently just to blend.

For mousse:                using electric mixer, beat peanut butter, brown sugar, and coarse salt in medium bowl to blend. With mixer running, gradually beat in 1/4 cup cream. Add another 1/4 cup cream and beat just to blend. Beat remaining 1/2 cup cream, sugar, and vanilla in another medium bowl until peaks form; fold into peanut butter mixture in 3 additions. Chill until ready to use.                                                                        For glaze:                Whisk cocoa powder and sugar in medium saucepan to blend well. Gradually add 1/4 cup water, whisking until smooth. Gradually whisk in heavy cream. Bring to boil over medium heat, whisking frequently. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Let stand at room temperature until cool and slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Spoon 1/4 cup glaze evenly over top of 2 meringue rectangles and spread to cover. Chill until chocolate sets, about 30 minutes. Place 1 glazed meringue rectangle on plate. Spoon half of mousse over (scant 1 1/4 cups); spread out in even layer. Place second glazed meringue rectangle atop first; spread with remaining mousse. Top with unglazed meringue rectangle. Pour 1/2 cup glaze down center of top meringue. Using icing spatula, spread glaze over top meringue, allowing glaze to drip down sides. Smooth top and sides to cover evenly with thin layer. Refrigerate until glaze is set, about 30 minutes. Pour remaining glaze over top of dacquoise andquickly smooth over top and sides in even layer. Sprinkle fleur de sel lightly over top, if desired.

If it gets to hard to spread, microwave it on 20 second intervals, stirring in between, until it\u2019s the desired consistency. Add cold heavy cream to an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Begin beating on high. (It helps if the bowl is also cold to start.) After a minute, add sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to the cream. Continue beating for another 1-2 minutes, until heavy peaks form. Scrape the sides and fold in any undissolved cinnamon.

small bowl. Transfer the mixture to a zip-topped bag. Set aside.To prepare the pancakes, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the butter, vanilla, and maple syrup. Mix in the Greek yogurt, stirring until no large lumps remain. (If the butter or coconut oil re-solidifies, briefly microwave the mixture for 10-15 seconds.) Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk, beginning and ending with the flour, stirring just until incorporated. (For best results, add the flour mixture in 4 equal parts.) Gently fold in the carrots.Lightly coat a large nonstick pan or griddle with nonstick cooking spray, and preheat over low heat.Using 2 tablespoons of batter for each pancake, dollop onto the hot pan, and spread into a circular shape if desired.

Freeze them for at least 2 hours, until they are solid and frozen throughout.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When you're nearing the end of the chilling period, start heating the oil for frying. Pour vegetable oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan until it is three inches deep (the amount of oil you use will depend on the size of your saucepan). Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy/deep fry thermometer. Heat until the oil reaches 375\u00b0F.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While you're waiting for the oil to heat up, prepare your frying station and batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in a bowl and set aside. Place the remaining  cup of flour in a small bowl and mix with the baking powder and salt; add the milk, vinegar, and oil, and whisking the wet ingredients into the dry until you have a relatively lump-free, smooth, thick batter.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Remove the frozen candy from the freezer. It's go time.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Dredge each piece of candy in flour, covering it completely. Holding it gently, dip each piece of candy into the batter until it is fully covered. Wipe hands off with a clean paper towel between dips, because your hands will probably get a little messy.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Quickly place the battered candy into the heated oil, being careful not to drop it and cause oil to splash up. Keep a close eye on the candy, because it will fry up quickly. If it bobs to the surface before it has turned golden, gently push it back down with a slotted spoon.                                                                                                                             7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once the candy has reached an appealing golden hue, remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and place on a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb excess grease. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining candy. While frying, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up or down accordingly, as the candy will melt if it is too hot, and it will take too long to fry and become greasy if the heat is too low.                                                                                                                            8

Let it cold.When it is cold enough, add yogurt, salt and dried mint. Stir.Then add flour little by little. Combine them very well. You will get a dough thicker than your regular cake batter.Transfer the dough into a large and deep tray. Knead it very well. Sprinkle a little flour on its surface and cover it with a piece of clean cloth. It doesn\u2019t stick to the cloth thanks to the flour on its surface. Let it to rise.You will see it rises the following day. Pour milk in a bowl, wet your hands in it, knead the dough, sprinkle a little flour on its surface and cover. Repeat this for 3 days kneading it once a day. Then give a one-day break. Knead it the following day. And repeat this every other day for 12 days. It smells sourish in the first week, but you will feel its nice fragrance in the second week.After this duration, lay a clean large sheet in a room which is airy enough. We will lay pieces from dough on this sheet. We shouldn\u2019t lay it under sun as sunlight removes the color of vegetables in dough.Take spoonful of dough and place it on this sheet. Repeat this until the dough finishes. Dough pieces on the sheet shouldn\u2019t touch one another.The surface of these dough pieces will get dry after a few hours. Flip them so that their bottoms get dry too. They shouldn\u2019t get too dry, they should be a little moist. When you\u2019re done with both sides, crumble them with your hands as thin as you can. If they are too dry, it will be very hard to crumble them, that\u2019s why they should be a little moist.Sift it on another clean sheet and take the thicker part on the surface of sifter on another sheet and dry it separately. They shouldn\u2019t mix (you can also make soup form thick part, don\u2019t waste them).Spread the sifted soup powder on the sheet in a thin layer and dry it mixing it with your hand occasionally in a day until it is completely dry. This might last about a week depending on weather conditions. It is ready to use now! Keep them in glass jars in a dry place.Heat olive oil. Put pepper paste and dried mint, mix them. Add 3 cups cold water. Pour 2 tbsp dried tarhana when it is still cold. Stir it occasionaly until it boils so that it doesn\u2019t get lumpy. Add garlic, salt and chili powder.Boil it for 10 minutes more. Serve it when it\u2019s still hot.
