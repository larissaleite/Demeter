In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip egg whites with cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes.

Spoon and dollop meringue into 3 to 4-inch circles (depending on how large you want them) onto parchment paper lined baking sheets then use the back of the spoon to create slight dips in their centers. Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes, then leave in oven with door closed, turn off oven and allow to rest in oven 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.To assemble, top meringues with Cream Cheese Whipped Cream then Raspberry Sauce and garnish with mint. Assemble just before serving.For the raspberry sauce:In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1/3 cup water. Add half of the raspberries, then cook mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly until mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and cool completely. Stir in remaining raspberries. Store in refrigerator in an airtight container.

"aggregateLikes": 438, "instructions": "Preparation                                        To make the ice cream:                Combine the milk, cream, lemon zest and 1/2 cup of the sugar in aheavy saucepan. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until almost simmering. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and the salt in a bowl. Slowly pour the hot liquid into the egg mixture, whisking as you pour. Return the mixtureto the saucepan. Cook, over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant plastic or a wooden spatula, until the custard reaches 175\u00b0F and lightly coats the spatula.                                                                Strain the custard into a clean bowl and cool over an ice bath until room temperature. Stir in the lemon juice. Refrigerate the custard for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Freeze until scoopable,about 4 hours, depending on your freezer.                                                            To make the cookies:                 Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, white pepper, and allspice. Stir in the salt.                                                                Beat the butter, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, and the brown sugar together until smooth. Stir in the egg. Mix in the molasses. Stir in the dry ingredients in 2 additions. Refrigerate the dough until very firm, at least 3 hours.                                                                Divide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic wrap, and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or up to 4 days. When firm, roll the dough on a lightly sugared work surface into two 9-inch-long logs.                                                                Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 3 baking pans with parchment paper. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch-thick slices. There should be at least 24 cookies. Put the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a bowl. Coat the cookies with the sugar. Place the cookies 2 1/2 inchesapart on the prepared pans. Bake the cookies until set and no longer wet looking, 10 to 12 minutes. They will be puffy when you take them out of the oven and will sink as they cool.                                                            To assemble the sandwiches:                 Place 12 of the cookies, bottom side up, on the work surface. Place a large scoop of ice cream on each. Top with a second cookie, bottom side against the ice cream, and gently press to adhere the sandwiches together. Serve immediately, or freeze until ready to serve. Once frozen, wrap well in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container.

inches overnight. Drain beans in a colander and return to kettle with enough water to cover by 2 inches. Cook beans at a bare simmer until just tender, about 1 hour, and drain in a colander.In a skillet, heat the oil and saute the onion and jalapeno until soft and beginning to caramelize, 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the ground turkey, Southwest Essence, chili powder, salt, cumin, oregano, and bay leaf and cook, stirring occasionally, until turkey is browned and cooked through, 6 minutes. Add the cornmeal and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth, canned tomatoes, canned chiles, and cilantro stems and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. After it has cooked for 30 minutes, add the cooked beans. Add the heavy cream and cilantro leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes longer.Serve the chili in deep bowls, garnished with dollops of sour cream, grated Cheddar cheese, and green onions to taste.

Add the chopped maraschino cherries and stir until evenly incorporated into the dough. Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill for 15-20 minutes. Shape the dough into 36 one inch balls. If the dough feels sticky, slightly wet hands will help with rolling the balls. Slightly flatten the rounded ball using the palms of your hands. Dip both sides of the cookie into the coarse organic whole cane sugar.Place the balls on parchment lined baking sheets 2 inches apart.

Season the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of the Essence, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour and cornmeal and season with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the Essence, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne. Dredge the shrimp in the seasoned flour mixture, coating the shrimp completely. Fry the shrimp in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with salt and hot sauce. Split the French bread loaves in half and brush both cut sides of the bread with some of the melted butter. Using a spatula, spread the mayonnaise on both sides of the bread, then sprinkle with hot sauce. Divide the shrimp evenly between the 2 sandwiches and garnish with the lettuce, tomato slices, sliced pickles and hot sauce, if desired. Serve with potato chips.

    To make the wasabi ketchup, whisk together the ketchup, soy sauce, and wasabi in a bowl; set aside.

breadcrumbs absorb all the milk, about 5 minutes. When the breadcrumbs are ready, mix them together with the ground beef, ground pork, black pepper, onion, soy sauce, and salt in a large bowl. Knead the meat until it becomes sticky and binds together; divide the mixture into 4 equal parts. Lightly dab your hands with sesame oil. Using your palms, roll each part of the meat into a ball, then pat the ball flat, shifting it from hand to hand, to form a 1/2-inch-thick patty (patting like this compresses the meat and removes air pockets). Press down to make an indentation in the center of the patty (which prevents the patty from puffing up into a ball while it grills). Place the completed patties on a sheet of aluminum foil.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Preheat a grill to medium.

In reality, this mixture is known to behave differently in every kitchen, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it becomes quite thick.)3. Slowly add the warm milk to the flour and butter paste in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Continue cooking, whisking almost constantly until the mixture thickens considerably, about 5 minutes. It should be thick but still spreadable and perhaps even pourable. Add the cheese, whisking constantly until it has melted. Season with the cayenne or hot sauce and salt and pepper to taste. If you want to be fussy about it, you can strain the sauce through a sieve to remove any lumps before serving.

oil, the red pepper flakes and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Put the cod on a plate; drizzle with the lemon juice and season with salt, pepper and the thyme.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Tear off four 16-inch sheets of parchment paper. Make the packets (see photo gallery): Arrange about one-quarter of the potato mixture on one sheet of parchment; top with a cod fillet and about one-quarter each of the olives and tomatoes (along with some liquid from the can). Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Seal as directed. Repeat to make 3 more packets; divide between 2 baking sheets.Transfer to the oven and bake until the parchment puffs and the liquid is bubbling, about 25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before opening. Meanwhile, mix the butter, chives, lemon zest and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Carefully open the packets; top with the chive butter.Photograph by David Malosh                                                            You can assemble any of these parchment packets up to 4 hours ahead and refrigerate.

Make the cakes: Brush four 1 1/4-cup brioche molds (or use 10-ounce ramekins or jumbo muffin cups) with the 2 tablespoons melted butter. Dust the molds with cocoa powder and tap out the excess.Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Bring the milk and 3/4 cup water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat; set aside.Combine the vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons room-temperature butter and the sugar in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the bowl and beater as needed. Add 1/2 cup cocoa powder and the vanilla; beat 1 minute on medium speed. Scrape down the bowl. Add 1 egg and beat 1 minute on medium-low speed, then add the remaining egg and beat 1 more minute.With the mixer on low speed, gradually beat in the flour mixture, then the hot milk mixture. Finish mixing the batter with a rubber spatula until combined. Divide the batter evenly among the molds, filling each slightly more than three-quarters of the way.Transfer the molds to a baking sheet and bake until the tops of the cakes are domed and the centers are just barely set, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack; let the cakes cool until they pull away from the molds, about 30 minutes.How To Assemble the Cake:Make the Filling: Microwave the chocolate, cream, butter and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring each time, until the chocolate starts to melt, 1 minute, 30 seconds. Let sit 3 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Reheat before using, if necessary.Use the tip of a paring knife to gently loosen the cakes from the molds, then invert the cakes onto a cutting board.Use the knife to cut a 1 1/2-inch circle on the top of each cake, cutting almost to the bottom.Hollow out the cake with a spoon; save the scraps. Wrap the cakes with plastic wrap and microwave until steaming, 1 minute.Drizzle plates with caramel, then unwrap the cakes and place on top. Pour about 3 tablespoons filling into each cake.Plug the hole with a cake scrap. Save or discard any remaining scraps.Top each cake with a scoop of ice cream. Spoon more chocolate sauce on top, spreading it thin so it hardens into a shell.Photograph by Jacob Snavely                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

While water comes to a boil, rinse tomatoes and remove stem; with a paring knife make a small X on the bottom of each tomato. Carefully add tomatoes to the hot water and boil for 5 minutes, remove from the heat, cover, and let sit for another 5 minutes.Fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. Add the tomatoes to the ice water and give them time to cool off, about 10 minutes. Add more ice if necessary. Peel cooled tomatoes; start from the bottom up. The curled edges help make the peeling easier.  With your hand, crush the tomatoes, into a non-stick pot. If they are still too hot, use a potato masher. Add the cinnamon and cloves and over low heat, boil roughly mashed tomatoes for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot.  Strain most of the water out of the tomato puree but leave enough in the tomatoes so they are not dry. I usually drain about 1 \u00bd to 2 cups of liquid. Reserve about \u00bd cup of the tomato liquid; refrigerate to cool. Remove the cinnamon and cloves from the tomatoes. Mash tomatoes again in the pot with a potato masher. Add sugar or piloncillo and cook uncovered for another 30 minutes. If needed add more sugar to taste. Add the cornstarch to \u00bd cup of reserved cold tomato liquid and whisk until well combined. Add cornstarch mixture to tomatoes and continue to cook for about 15 minutes. Cook until the consistency is like preserves.As the tomato preserves cool it will thicken. Can as needed or use immediately. Make empanada dough:Mix the first 3 dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening with the dry ingredients. Works better if you use your hands. Add the eggs, milk and sugar. Continue to work in with your hands. Split the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap and put into the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes. Take out one half of the dough and split it into 12 rounds of dough. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Assemble turnovers:Roll out one round of dough into a small round circle. Take a paring knife and cut off the edges creating a square. Add about one tablespoon of preserves on one half of the rolled out dough. Bring down the top corner and match it up with the bottom corner, creating a triangle. Seal off the edges of the dough by pressing down on the edges with a fork. This also makes for a pretty pattern when baked. Continue doing this until you have used up all your rounds and the scraps of dough. Remove the second half of the dough from the fridge and repeat.Assemble flower-shaped empanadas:Roll out one round of dough into a small round circle. Take a paring knife and cut off the edges creating a square. Add about one tablespoon of preserves directly in the middle of your square. Pull up the four corners of the dough and pinch together tightly at the center, making sure that all four corners won\u2019t come apart. With your fingers, squeeze the outer tips of the dough, creating a seal so the preserves don\u2019t escape during baking. Bake:Brush each empanada with egg whites, sprinkle with sugar. Layer a large cookie sheet with parchment paper, place the empanadas on the parchment paper and bake for 15 minutes on the bottom rack in the oven. If after 15 minutes you notice the tops are not brown, move the baking sheet to the broiler and let them brown for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
