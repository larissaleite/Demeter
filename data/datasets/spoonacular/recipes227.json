Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and just starting to brown. Transfer onions and oil to a large bowl. Add eggs and vinegar and whisk to combine. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds black pepper. Fold in potato chips until they are well coated.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Wipe out skillet and add remaining two tablespoons olive oil. Return to medium heat until shimmering. Add egg/potato chip mixture and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, for 10 seconds. Shake pan to evenly distribute mixture, then even out top with the spatula. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until tortilla is mostly set but still wet on the top, about 2 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Place a large metal or glass pot lid over the tortilla. Using kitchen towels to grip the lid and the pan handle, carefully invert the entire tortilla so that it's resting on top of the pan lid. Slide tortilla back into skillet so that the cooked side is now facing up. Use the spatula to tuck down the edges and create an even disk shape. Continue to cook, shaking occasionally, until tortilla is golden brown on second side and barely cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Slide tortilla out onto cutting board.                                                                                                                            5

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves.    Cool slightly.    In a large bowl, combine eggs, bourbon, vanilla, and salt. Mix well.    Slowly pour the sugar mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.    Stir in chocolate chips and pecans.    Set aside half of the pie filling.    Fold 3/4 of one of the halves into the chocolate cupcake batter. You don't need to mix it well, just give it a nice stir.    Fill 24 cupcake liners about half way.    Use up the remaining 1/4 of the first half by putting an additional spoonful or two of the pie filling on top of each cupcake being careful not to fill them more than 3/4.    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pour the second half of the pie filling onto the baking sheet. This is going to be used in the frosting.
