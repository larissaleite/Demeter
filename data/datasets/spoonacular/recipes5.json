In a small bowl, whisk mix together the egg, vinegar and water. Add the cold butter pieces into the food processor and pulse until small coarse crumbs remain. Sprinkle the water/egg mixture over the flour and pulse again until the dough comes together.Remove the dough with your hands and wrap it in plastic wrap. This dough makes enough for 3 pie crusts, so you can either separate it into 3 sections now, or separate it after it's refrigerated. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For this pie, I did happen to roll out one of my doughs, place it in a 9.5 inch pie plate and blind bake it for 15 minutes. Roll the pie crust out into a 12-inch circle (if you're using a 9.5-inch pie plate). Fold it in half to pick it up and gently place it in the plate, unfolding as you go and trimming any excess off of the edges - you can also use a fork (or another decorative idea!) to press the edges down. I placed parchment paper on the dough and covered it in dry beans. Bake for 15 minutes and remove! As a note, I took a second crust out of the fridge, rolled out it to about 1/4-inch thickness and used a star cookie cutter to make cut shapes. I think having a few different sizes would be fun too! fillingIn a large bowl, combine the pitted cherries, cornstarch, sugar and vanilla paste in a bowl, tossing well to coat. Allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes (at this time I usually blind bake the crust or cut the stars) before using. Once the crust is blind baked, place the cherry filling inside the crust, spreading it out evenly. Place the crust cut-outs of stars on top - there is no rhyme or reason, just place them on there so they cover the pie. Refrigerate the pie for 1 hour (this is in mother lovett's cherry pie recipe, I tried it and I think helps the cherries stay together more?) then remove from the fridge. Brush the crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar (fine or coarse works). Bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes. At this time, it's up to you if you want to cover the edges of the crust with foil strips in case they brown too much. I choose not to, and just check the pie halfway through. At any time you can place foil on the edges to keep them from browning.

                               In a small pot or saucepan, mix the vinegar, water, and the sugar. Add the orange juice, mustard seed, and the peppercorns. Bring the pickling liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes or longer.                                                                            While the liquid is cooling, cut the beet into olive-size cubes and place them with the garlic in a clean container.                                                                            When the liquid is lukewarm, pour it into your container, covering the beets. Close the container tightly, give it 5 or 6 good shakes, and stick the beets in the fridge to cool. In 24 to 48 hours, they will be ready to eat and will stay fresh in the fridge for 1 week.                                                                            Once your beets have pickled, it's time to roast your bell peppers. Put them in a baking pan and place under the broiler. Turn the broiler to high and check every 5 minutes or so to see if the skin has blistered and charred. Then, using tongs, rotate the peppers to blister and char the other sides.                                                                            Remove the bell peppers from the oven and put them in a paper bag. Close the top and allow them to steam for 15 minutes. When cool to the touch, slide the skin off the peppers and discard. Slice the fl esh horizontally into thin strips and then chop in half. Set aside.                                                                            To prepare the fennel, cut the stems and the bottom nub from the fennel bulbs and remove the outer layer if bruised. Cut the bulbs vertically in half. Place the fl at side of each half on a cutting board and slice the fennel into thin, crescent-shaped spears. Discard the hard core and set the fennel spears aside.                                                                            Chop the romaine leaves into bite-size pieces and put them in a large mixing bowl, gently tossing with the red wine vinegar and olive oil. Next, place the ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and fennel seed in another bowl and mix.                                                                            To assemble the salad, spread the romaine on a serving dish or platter. Cover with rows of green peppers, fennel, tomatoes, beet, cucumbers, and red peppers. Sprinkle with ricotta and freshly ground black pepper.                                    sodium count: Beet: 64mg per beet; Fennel: 45mg per 1 cup, 122mg per bulb; Low-sodium ricotta: 24mg per 1/4 cup depending on brand; Sundried tomato: 5mg per serving depending on brand; Cherry tomatoes: 7mg per 1 cupNutritional analysis provided by Sodium Girl's Limitless Low-Sodium Cookbook                            Reprinted with permission from the publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

With a marker, mark a 7-inch circle on a piece of parchment paper. Flip the parchment over and place on a baking sheet.In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch.In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites with a pinch of salt and beat with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Add 3 tablespoons water and keep beating until you get soft peaks again.Increase the mixer speed to high. Add the sugar mixture 1 tablespoon at a time and continue to beat for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and beat until the meringue is glossy and holds stiff peaks, about 5 minutes.Spread the meringue inside the marked circle on the parchment, making the edges slightly higher than the inside of the circle (it should look like a \"crater\"). Bake until the meringue is pale golden and has a crust, about 45 minutes; the inside should still be marshmallow-like. Turn off the oven, prop the door open and let the meringue dry for 1 hour.To serve, place the Pavlova on a serving dish. Spread the inside of the crater with a thin layer of lemon curd. Top with berries and serve.

Place on a plate and sprinkle fairly generously all over with kosher salt and pepper.Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. On the stove top, set a 6-3/4 quart oval French oven over medium to medium-high heat. When the pot is warmed up, coat the bottom with the canola oil. When the oil is hot and shimmering, place the chicken, skin side down, in the pot and let it cook, without moving it, until the skin is nicely browned. This should take about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.Add onions, garlic, and mushrooms to the pot and cook, stirring, until softened. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in olives, thyme, the teaspoon of kosher salt, and a few good grinds of fresh black pepper. Then pour in shandy. Stir to release browned bits on the pan bottom. Let mixture come to a boil, then rest the chicken pieces on top of the mushroom and green olive mixture, taking care to not submerge the chicken skin under the liquid. Transfer pot to the oven and cook for 35 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken thighs, until meat is tender and cooked through. Remove pot from oven. With tongs, remove chicken pieces to a roasting pan.Set pot back on the stove top over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. In a small bowl, whisk together chicken broth and cornstarch and stir into the boiling liquid. Turn heat down a bit, keeping a very low boil, and let liquid thicken and reduce for about 10 minutes. While liquid is reducing, move oven rack up under the broiler and turn on broiler. Place roasting pan with chicken under the broiler until skin is perfectly browned and ultra crispy. Remove from oven.Stir lemon juice into the liquid in the pot. Then taste and adjust with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Nestle the crispy chicken pieces on top of the mushrooms and green olives and serve immediately.

Add butter, oats and chopped almonds and, using the paddle attachment of the mixer, mix the ingredients on low speed just until a soft dough forms; this will take less than a minute.Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and spread out to the corners. If your dough is too soft, refrigerate it for a few minutes to make it more manageable. I rubbed my fingertips with a little butter to keep from sticking. It's also much easier to push and press the dough out from the center to the corners.Cover the dough with wax paper or foil and add pie weights. Bake for 10 minutes then remove the weights and cover and bake for another five minutes.To prepare the filling: Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil then add the cranberries. Cook on med to medium-high heat until the cranberries pop, about 5-6 minutes. Add the butter and juice and cook for another 3-4 minutes on medium low heat until the mixture thickens.The crust should be ready by the time the cranberries finish cooking. Pour the cranberries into the pre-baked crust and distribute evenly onto the pan. Place the baking pan back in the oven, raise the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F and bake for another 15 minutes.

Grease two 9x5x3-inch loaf pans and line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper.Make the chocolate batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar with the paddle attachment on medium speed, until light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating until each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next and scraping down the sides of the bowl several times.Meanwhile in a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, cinnamon, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, water and vanilla. With mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture to butter, beginning and ending with the flour and beating just until blended. Divide the batter between the two pans, shake the pans to even the tops and set aside.Make the cocoa-spice sugar crust: In another bowl, whisk together the sugar, cinnamon, cocoa, ginger and cloves. Sprinkle the surfaces of both batters with the cocoa sugar mixture, dividing evenly. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 to 50 minutes.

In the first dish, add the flour, salt, and pepper; mix well.  In the second dish, add the 2 beaten eggs. In the last dish, combine the panko and parmesan cheese. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Line a large jelly roll pan/baking sheet with foil, and top with an oven-safe cookie cooling rack. Spray well with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is nice and hot, pan sear the chicken (only 2 at a time to avoid over-crowding) for 2-3 minutes per side. Keep a close eye as they will brown quickly due to the parmesan cheese. They should be nice and golden when you flip them. Once both sides are browned, remove and place onto prepared pan. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and olive oil and repeat process with the last 2 chicken breasts.Place pan into oven and bake for 12-18 minutes at 350\u00ba F until chicken is cooked through (cooking time depends on how thin you pound out the chicken).For the Lemon Butter Sauce:While chicken is baking, add the butter, olive oil, and chicken broth to the pan that the chicken was cooked in. Bring to a simmer and whisk the flour into it until all of the lumps have been removed and it begins to thicken. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. reduce heat to low. Once chicken is about ready, add the half and half and lemon juice to the sauce and whisk together until warmed through. Serve chicken over mashed potatoes with a drizzle of the sauce.
