Cut the dough into quarters.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Roll the first quarter into about a 6-inch square. Cut the square into quarters diagonally.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Take one of your right triangles of dough and roll or stretch it into a pie-shaped wedge at least seven inches long. You can make it longer if the dough is thick enough to allow it, but at least seven inches will give you enough length to have attractive wraps.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Starting at the wide end, roll the dough toward the the point.                                                                                                                            10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place the finished croissants on the prepared baking sheet with the point underneath. Curl the dough into a crescent shape.                                                                                                                            11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cover them with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes. They won't rise much at all, but they should feel puffy instead of firm. Brush the croissants with an egg wash, if desired, or leave them plain. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, until they are golden brown. Remove to a rack to cool.                                                                                                                            12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Variation: For chocolate croissants, follow the original recipe though Step 6, then roll the quarter of dough into a rectangle about 10 x 6 inches. Cut that into strips about 2 1/2 inches wide x 6 inches long.                                                                                                                            13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Put your favorite chocolate at one end, and roll up. It works best to make sure the dough is just a little wider than the chocolate and fold it over to enclose the chocolate when you start rolling, so it doesn't seep out during baking. Place the rolls seam-side down on the pan and allow them to rise and bake as in the original recipe.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bread-baking-easyer-croissants-199260", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Tessa the Domestic Diva", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Paleo-Dark-Chocolate---Raspberry-Truffles-542996.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 8, "id": 542996, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Paleo Dark Chocolate & Raspberry Truffles", "preparationMinutes": 20, "pricePerServing": 18.44, "creditText": "Tessa the Domestic Diva", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bc cup (2 oz) melted cocoa butter + 3 tablespoons for coating (see link above for what I use)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cocoa", "metaInformation": ["melted", "for coating (see link above for what i use)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19165, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd tablespoons honey or coconut nectar (to taste) + 1 tablespoon for coating", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "coconut", "metaInformation": ["for coating", "to taste", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.5, "id": 12104, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons coconut butter", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "coconut butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93746, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons coconut oil + 3 tablespoons for the coating", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut oil", "metaInformation": ["for the coating"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4047, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 bag freeze-dried raspberries, blended into a powder and sifted to remove seeds", "aisle": "Dried Fruits", "name": "freeze dried strawberries", "metaInformation": ["sifted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-fruit-mixed.jpg", "unitLong": "bag", "unitShort": "bag", "amount": 1.0, "id": 98946, "unit": "bag"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup cocoa powder, unsweetened + 3 tablespoons for the coating", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened", "for the coating"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19165, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 30.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tessadomesticdiva.com/2013/05/paleo-dark-chocolate-raspberry-truffles.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}], "step": "In a small saucepan over low heat, gently melt \u00bc cup cocoa butter and 2T coconut oil.Once liquified, whisk in the coconut butter until smooth.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-oil.jpg", "id": 93746, "name": "coconut butter"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "id": 4047, "name": "coconut oil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "id": 19165, "name": "cocoa powder"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}], "step": "Remove from the heat and whisk in remaining ingredients (remember to sift those seeds out first so as NOT to have that seedy crunch!)Taste the mixture and add more salt or honey if you like.", "number": 2, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Pour into a bowl, place in the fridge to solidify (about 30 minutes or so).

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and place a rack in the middle of the oven.Place the butternut squash halves cut-side up on a baking sheet lined with foil. Rub 1 teaspoon of the oil on the squash. Sprinkle the squash with the salt if using and the black pepper. Roast the squash until fork tender, 50 to 55 minutes.Cool the squash for 10 minutes. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh (about 2 cups) and set aside.Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery, curry powder, garlic and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are fork tender, about 5 minutes. Add the squash, broth and coconut milk to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 5 to 7 minutes.Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender or food processor until smooth and silky. Serve warm and garnish with a little chopped parsley.                                                                    Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.                                            (c) 2014 Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
