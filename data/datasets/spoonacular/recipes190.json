Set aside the grilled pepper halves.Put the grilled tomatoes and onion, garlic, chipotles, cilantro, juice of 1 lime and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a food processor, and pulse about 20 times for a chunky salsa.Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits and scoop out the flesh with a spoon into a medium  bowl. Add the remaining lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mash the avocado lightly with a fork so that some large pieces remain.Stuff about 2 tablespoons of the Monterey Jack into each pepper half. Place a piece of aluminum foil, large enough to hold all the peppers, on the grill. Arrange the stuffed pepper halves on the foil. Cover the grill to melt the cheese, about 4 minutes.Heat the tortillas on the grill for about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side for light grill marks. Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil to keep them warm and soft.To assemble a taco, spread some of the avocado on a tortilla. Top with a stuffed pepper half, followed by a spoonful of salsa, a dollop of the sour cream and some torn cilantro leaves.Copyright 2014 Cooking Channel, LLC.

When the coconut milk reaches a gentle simmer, add the peanut butter, curry paste, fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and garlic. Whisk and keep on high heat for 15 minutes or until the sauce has reduced and thickened.Add the peanuts and simmer for another 5-10 minutes. When the sauce coats the back of a spoon, add small amounts of broth or water and whisk to adjust consistency depending on how you will use it and how thick you want it. If the sauce separates, just whisk vigorously to smooth it out again.Serve over rice, noodles, chicken, fish, vegetables, or any other way that sounds good to you!
