Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until slightly smoking, and add the sausage meat. Cook until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes, breaking it up with a fork as it cooks.

Put the turkey pieces on a rimmed baking sheet, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Roast until browned and cooked through, about 30 minutes.Transfer the roasted turkey pieces to a medium saucepan; scrape up any brown bits from the baking sheet, and add them to the saucepan. Add the stock, thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 30 minutes to enrich the stock with roasted-turkey flavor. Strain the liquid into a heat-safe bowl, and keep warm.Melt the butter in the saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour, and whisk until the mixture is smooth, toasted and a deep golden brown. Slowly pour in the warm broth, whisking continuously, and continue whisking until the mixture comes to a simmer. Continue to cook, still whisking, until the gravy is thick and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Let the gravy cool to room temperature. Transfer it to an airtight container or resealable plastic freezer bag, label and date, and freeze for up to 2 weeks.To serve, reheat the frozen gravy in a saucepan or a microwave. Be sure to whisk vigorously as the gravy heats up to keep lumps from forming. Adjust the seasoning as needed.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Squish 2 balls of doughtogether on the paper, keeping the\u2018round\u2019 edges of the balls at the top, butpinching together at the base where theymeet, so they make a rough heart shape.Flatten with the palm of your hand to abiscuit, then press in heart-shaped \u2018dent\u2019for the jam \u2013 thumbs and fingers areperfect for this. Repeat with remainingdough balls leaving a little space betweeneach finished heart shape for spreading.Spoon the jam into a food bag (ordisposable piping bag), snip off the endand pipe roughly 2-3 tsp jam into thethumb-heart dips you have made in eachbiscuit. Bake for 8-12 mins until palegolden and crisp. Cool on the trays.Mix the custard powder and icingsugar, then dribble in enough waterto make a runny icing. Drizzle all overthe cooled biscuits, allow to set for atleast 10 mins, then serve or store ina biscuit tin.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/jammy-heart-drops-214552", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 65, "servings": 18, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Baked by Rachel", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pesto-Knots-609703.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 609703, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Pesto Knots", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Baked by Rachel", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp active dry yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "active yeast", "metaInformation": ["dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18375, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2C bread flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "bread flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10120129, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp dried basil", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "dried basil", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2003, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "3/8 tsp garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.375, "id": 1022020, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2-4 Tbsp pesto sauce", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "pesto sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pesto.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93698, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2C water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14412, "unit": "C"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 39.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bakedbyrachel.com/pesto-knots/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 413, "instructions": "Heat water to 115\u00b0F.

center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack.Using 3 wide shallow bowls, add the flour to 1, the eggs to another and to the third bowl combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and thyme.On a work surface, put the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, lightly pound the chicken until approximately 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour to coat lightly, then dip into the beaten eggs, allowing the excess egg to drip off. Coat the chicken with the bread crumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.In a large, nonstick saute pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add 2 pieces of the breaded chicken into the oil and cook until light golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the chicken to the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Reserve the cooking juices in the saute pan.For the sauce: Using the same saute pan, add the olive oil to the reserved cooking juices and heat over medium heat. Add the fennel and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the cherry tomatoes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, garlic and thyme. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes until the tomatoes are tender. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the mascarpone cheese and stir until the mixture is creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and spoon the sauce over the top before serving.

flour, graham cracker crumbs, and salt. Add in the butter and pulse just until the mixture resembles coarse meal, with some larger chunks of butter remaining. Add the ice water and egg and pulse until it just comes together without being wet, sticky, or crumbly. If the dough doesn\u2019t hold together when pinched between your fingers, add another tablespoon of water and pulse. You can also make the dough by hand with a pastry blender.Shape the dough into a disk and cover wrap with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. You can also freeze the dough, well wrapped in plastic, for up to 2 months. Defrost in the fridge overnight.For the filling:In a small saucepan, combine the cocoa powder, brown sugar, milk, salt, and chocolate. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the chocolate is melted. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and add in the butter, stirring until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Mixture will thicken as it cools.To assemble:Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place between two sheets of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough into even rectangles. Place 1 tablespoon of chocolate fudge and 1 tablespoon of marshmallow cr\u00e8me on a dough rectangle, leaving a 3/4-inch border. Top with another piece of dough, pressing out any air and using the tine of a fork to seal the edges. Repeat with the remaining dough rectangles and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush all over the tops of the pop tarts. Prick each tart a few times with a skewer or toothpick to allow steam to escape. Chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, or until the dough has stiffened slightly.Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.

Let it sit for 15 minutes at room temperature. This is called macerating, and we are softening the strawberries and intensifying their flavor.Puree the strawberries in a food processor or blender, taking care to leave some small chunks of strawberry. Pour the mixture in a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl, letting some of the excess liquid drain. Set the drained pureed strawberries aside.In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks on high speed for 8 minutes until they are very pale. In the meantime, combine the sugar and water in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, and let the sugar syrup simmer toward the soft ball stage, which is 238 degrees on an instant read thermometer. When both the egg yolks and the sugar syrup are ready, pour the sugar syrup into the mixing bowl (the mixer should still be on high speed), aiming as best as you can to pour between the wire whisk and the side of the bowl. Now, touch the bottom of the bowl. It's pretty hot, right? Beat the egg yolk sugar mixture until the bowl feels neither hot nor cold (about 5 minutes). The egg yolk sugar mixture will be very runny at this point.Turn the mixer down to medium and add two tbsp of the strawberry puree.

Add red onion and cook until translucent, stirring periodically. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes more.Add water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, orange juice, sugar, Sriracha sauce and salt, and stir well. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower to a simmer. Let it simmer for about 20 minutes.Add peaches to the sauce and let it cook down until soft. Transfer sauce to a blender and blend until smooth. Pass the sauce through a sieve and return to the stove to simmer for about 5-10 minutes more, or until nicely thickened.Make the Mop:Combine ingredients and use to baste ribs periodically.Make the Ribs:The methods for grilling pork ribs vary, and we've tried almost all of them. This includes:Parboiling the ribs prior to grillingGrilling the ribs with sauce in a packet of aluminum foil, then allowing the ribs to caramelize on the grill towards the end.Using a dry rubSmoking the ribs low and slow for 5-6 hoursGrilling the ribs on low heat for about 1 1/2 hoursBasting the ribs grills periodically with a mopIn this case, we decided to use a dry rub. I actually like Tyler Florence's brown sugar rub, and it worked very well with this Fiery Peach BBQ Sauce. You can find the packaged rub, at your local grocer. We grilled the ribs coated with olive oil and the brown sugar rub on very low heat for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, rotating and mopping it every half hour (see Mop Recipe below). When the rib meat was very tender and the rack slack to the touch, the sauce was brushed on. Be very careful with flareups from the sugar content in the barbecue sauce, move the ribs to the outskirts of the grill if necessary. Serve the ribs with a generous drizzle of sauce.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baby-back-ribs-with-fiery-peach-bbq-sauce-497046", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/lavender-pink-peppercorn-vodka-sodas-763031.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 763031, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Lavender-Pink Peppercorn Vodka Sodas", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 liter club soda", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "club soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water-sparkling.jpg", "unitLong": "liter", "unitShort": "l", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14121, "unit": "liter"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup dried lavender", "aisle": "Gourmet", "name": "lavender honey", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10019296, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Lemon wedges, for serving", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon wedges", "metaInformation": ["for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-wedge.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9150, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pink peppercorns, plus more for garnish", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "peppercorns", "metaInformation": ["plus more for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Sprigs of fresh lavender, for serving", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "thyme sprigs", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "Sprig", "unitShort": "Sprigs", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2049, "unit": "Sprigs"}, {"originalString": "1 vanilla bean", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla bean", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93622, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "8 to 12 ounces good-quality vodka", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "vodka", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vodka.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 14051, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 1.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/lavender-pink-peppercorn-vodka-sodas.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 14, "aggregateLikes": 12, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Combine the sugar, lavender, peppercorns and 1 cup water in a small saucepan.

Line an 8-inch or 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper and set aside. (You can use a 9x13-inch if you want thinner bars.)2. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the oatmeal, 1 cup of the chocolate chips, the peanut butter and vanilla extract; set aside.3. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, milk, butter and salt over medium heat. Bring to a full boil (there should be bubbles covering the entire surface) and boil for 2 minutes.4. Immediately pour the hot mixture (carefully!) over the oatmeal mixture and quickly stir to combine, ensuring that all of the oatmeal mixture has been moistened. Turn the mixture into the parchment-lined pan and use the back of a spoon to press it evenly into the pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of chocolate chips over top and gently press them into the top of the mixture.5. Allow the bars to sit at room temperature to set up, which takes about 30 minutes. Use the edges of the parchment paper to lift the bars out of the pan and cut into squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.Note: Like any no-bake cookie, the final texture of these really depends on how long you boil the sugar mixture. If it doesn't boil long enough, the cookie mixture will be too soft; if you boil too long, they could turn out dry and crumbly.

Thoroughly wash two pint or four half-pint canning jars and their lids and screw bands. Place the jars, lids, and screw bands in a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for 15 minutes to sterilize them. Turn off the heat and leave the jars, lids, and bands in the hot water until ready to use. Place a small plate in the freezer for testing the jam.2. Pick through the berries, discarding any soft or rotten ones. Gently rinse the berries and place them in a large, heavy nonreactive saucepan. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the lemon juice. Reduce the heat and simmer the berry mixture, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the jam thickens to a viscous consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. As the jam cooks, use a large spoon to skim any foam from the surface. After the jam has cooked for an hour, test it to see if the jam has reached the jell point by removing the plate from the freezer, placing 1 teaspoon jam on the plate, and tipping the plate slightly. If the jam doesn\u2019t spread, it\u2019s ready. You can also test the jam for readiness with a candy thermometer, which should register 220\u00baF (104\u00baC) when the jam reaches the jell point. [Editor's Note: \"Jell\" point or \"gel\" point? We rather have an affinity for \"jell,\" thinking perhaps it's an old-fashioned term for the proper consistency. As such, we rather like to use it, even though it's not in common parlance.]3. Lift the jars, lids, and screw bands from the water, using tongs if the water is still hot, and thoroughly dry them. Carefully ladle the hot jam into the sterilized jars, leaving a 1/2-inch space between the jam and the top of the jar. Wipe each jar rim clean with a damp towel, then top with a lid and seal tightly with a screw band. Let the jars cool overnight at room temperature. Label the jars with the recipe name and date. You can store them in the refrigerator, unopened, for up to 3 months. Once opened, use within a week or so.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/refrigerator-jam-596993", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 2,
