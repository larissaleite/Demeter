Coat the bottoms and sides of a 9x9x2 inch baking pan with non-stick cooking spray.In a small bowl, combine the Oreo crumbs and butter until combined. Place in the bottom of the baking pan. Sprinkle the shredded coconut, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips. Scatter on the pecans or walnuts, and lightly press down the nuts with your fingertips. Pour the sweetened condensed milk evenly over the top, taking care to drizzle it uniformly to \u00bc inch of all four sides of the pan.Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until set and light golden brown on top. Set the pan on a rack to cool completely. You can place it in the refrigerator to cool faster.Once the bars have cooled, melt the almond bark and drizzle on top. Refrigerate until drizzle has set and cut into small squares with a sharp knife. Store in an airtight tin, in one layer or with wax paper separating each layer.

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add the onion and crushed red pepper flakes and cook until the onions begin to soften, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, tie the parsley sprigs, lemon zest, and fennel tops together. Add the herb bundle, broth, 2 cups of water, and, if using, the cheese rind. Bring to a very gentle simmer and simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones in large strips, and set aside. 2. Meanwhile, add the sliced fennel, carrots, and celery to the broth and season with salt, to taste. Continue to simmer until the vegetables are just tender, 5 minutes. Stir in the noodles and cook until just al dente, about 5 minutes. Stir in the reserved chicken, baby spinach, and Parmesan until the chicken is heated through and the spinach is wilted. Discard the herb bundle and cheese rind. Stir in lemon juice, to taste. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and serve with additional Parmesan for passing.Copyright 2010 Television Food Network, G.P.
