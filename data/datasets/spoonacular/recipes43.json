sauce, puree a whole can in a food processor or blender. Keep on hand in your refrigerator to use when you need a bit of smoky heat.Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat and add the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup of the pico de gallo and the chipotle in adobo, if using, and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes begin to break down, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer.Sprinkle the pork with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the pork to the skillet with the sauce and return to a simmer. Cover the skillet and simmer, flipping once, until the pork is just cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the pork, cover loosely with aluminum foil and set aside for 5 minutes.Meanwhile, bring the sauce in the skillet to a boil and cook over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Shred the pork with 2 forks, add it back to the skillet and toss well to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.Divide the shredded pork among the tostadas. Top with lettuce, cheese and the remaining pico de gallo. Drizzle with crema and top with radish slices. Serve with lime wedges.Cook's Note: Make your own tostadas by brushing corn tortillas lightly with oil and broiling 6 inches from the heat source, turning once, until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes.

   To make the pie crust: In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and sugar until everything is thoroughly combined. Add the butter and shortening and cut the mixture together using a pastry cutter until it forms small pea-size crumbs coated in flour.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Pour the vodka evenly over the dry ingredients, a few tablespoons at a time, using a rubber spatula to press the dough together. Similarly, add the water, and continue to press the dough together to form a large ball. The dough should be fairly wet and sticky; if for some reason it seems particularly dry, add a little extra ice water a tablespoon at a time until everything comes together easily. (Be careful to work the dough as little as possible; otherwise the crust may be tough.)                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Divide the dough into two equal balls, press each into a disk, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate for at least an hour or up to 2 days before rolling out.Note: This recipe calls for only one disk of dough; the other can be kept in the freezer up to 3 months.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            To make the tart: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F with a rack in the middle position. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Stir together the sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch in a small bowl until combined.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Place the pears in a large bowl and pour the sugar mixture over them. With your hands or a large spoon, gently toss the fruit to coat evenly. Set aside.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Roll out the crusts: Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form each into a 1-inch-thick disk. On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll one piece of dough into a rough 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough circle to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough disk, placing it next to the first dough circle on the baking sheet.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Give the pear mixture one final stir and arrange 1 cup of pears in the center of the first dough circle, leaving a 1-inch edge all around (if your pears are very juicy, you may wish to strain off half of the liquid first). Crumble half of the goat cheese evenly over the fruit filling.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Starting on one side, fold the edge of the crust up and over the edge of the filling.

Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until lightly golden, 5 to 10 more minutes. Let cool while you prepare the filling.Make the filling: Put the roasted peppers and scallions in a large bowl. Add the sausage and cheddar and toss to combine.Whisk the eggs, heavy cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the parsley. Add the paprika, chile powder or lemon zest, if desired. Spread the vegetable-cheese mixture in the crust, then pour the egg mixture on top.

Process until pureed. On medium speed, slowly drizzle a few drops of olive oil until it starts to emulsify. Continue drizzling in the olive oil until has all been added, being careful not to add it too fast or it will break.

Spread the bread crumbs on a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven, and wait until lightly toasted, about eight minutes.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Dry the squid pieces on paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Add as much of the squid as will fit in one layer. At first, the squid pieces will stick to the pan. Once they release or curl up, which takes five to ten seconds, flip the pieces. Cook until the pieces appear white, another five to ten seconds. Transfer the pieces to a bowl.

Turn heat to medium and simmer for a few minutes. Whisk in the vinegar, and then two tablespoons of olive oil. Once mixture is emulsified, turn off the heat, and whisk in the a\u00efoli. Pour at least half of this sauce over the squid. Add all of it if you're feeling like it (see note above).                                                                                                                              6                                                                            Sprinkle in about half of the breadcrumbs into the bowl with the squid.

Blot the top of the bacon with several layers of paper towels to absorb any additional fat. Set aside.                                                                2.

I suggest you lightly beat the egg with a fork and add little bits until the dough comes together into a soft but pliable dough. You only have to knead it a bit, not as much as you knead a yeasted bread. It's OK if it is slightly sticky.Form balls with the dough and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicon mat or lightly greased with vegetable oil. If necessary, you can oil your hands to make shaping easier. The size of the balls may vary from small bite-sized balls to the size of ping pong balls. They will puff up quite a bit after baking. I personally prefer the smaller ones.Bake for about 25 minutes or until they just start to brown on the bottom. You may have golden spots of cheese on the crust.

Add bacon and shallots to pot and cook until shallots have softened and bacon has rendered but not crisped, about 3 minutes (reduce heat if browning too quickly).                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Whisk in cider, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pot. Whisk in mustard, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper. Nestle chicken (skin side up) and sage sprigs into liquid, and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low, and gently simmer until chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 40 minutes (adjust heat to keep at gentle simmer).                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer chicken to serving plate. Whisk cream into cooking liquid and simmer 1 minute. Transfer 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid to a small bowl and whisk in flour, then return to pot. Bring to a boil to thicken. Stir in apples and chopped sage, and season to taste.

Prepare the crust: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0. Line a 9x12-inch baking pan with parchment paper (you want the parchment to come up the sides so you can use it as \"handles\" later to lift the dessert out of the pan). With an electric mixer, beat the butter with the sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. At low speed, beat in the flour, spices and salt until a soft dough forms. Use clean hands to press the dough over the bottom of the prepared pan and 1/2 inch up the side in an even layer. Bake in the center of the oven for about 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and set. Let cool on a rack.2. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Place the peaches in a large bowl.  Drizzle in the butter and stir in the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. 3. Prepare the topping: In a large bowl, mix the oats with the flour, light brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Using fingers (wash your hands and take off your rings first!), squeeze the butter into the oats & sugar and crumble together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. (Alternately, you can use a pastry cutter, but ultimately you'll want to just use your hands).  4. Assemble the bars: Spread the peach filling over the crust. Scatter raspberries on top and then the crumbs.  Bake in the center of the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the topping is golden.  Let cool completely on a rack before cutting into 2-inch bars.  It's even better if you have time to refrigerate the bars until chilled and then cut from there.  Once the pie bars have cooled completely, use the handles of the parchment paper to gently lift them out of the pan and onto a cutting board.

Stir in the onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are soft and even begin to caramelize slightly, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add in the potatoes, stock and ale. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce it to medium-low and let it simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat.Carefully pour the contents in a high-powered blender (if needed, you can do it in two batches). Blend until smooth. Pour the soup back into the pot and heat it over low heat, stirring well. Stir in the grated cheese, one handful at a time, until it completely melts. Make sure you add the cheese SLOWLY over low heat, so it melts right into the soup. Taste and season additionally if desired - you may want a little more salt and pepper depending on the saltiness of your cheese!To serve the soup, drizzle 1 tablespoon of cream over top. Top with a handful of the beer battered leeks, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, some fresh herbs and pepper. Serve immediately.beer battered leeksCover a large plate with a paper towel or two.Heat about 2 to 3 inches of oil over medium heat in a heavy bottomed saucepan. You want the oil to be about 350 degrees F. In this instance, I don't always use a candy thermometer - I test it with one of the leeks! Just don't let the oil burn.Whisk together 1 cup offlour, salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika. Whisk in the beer until the batter is smooth. Place the other cup of flour in a plate.
