Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter and vanilla bean seeds in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter and vanilla bean seeds about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 20081, "name": "all purpose flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "id": 2050, "name": "vanilla extract"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "id": 18371, "name": "baking powder"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg", "id": 93622, "name": "vanilla bean"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 10020129, "name": "cake flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "id": 19335, "name": "sugar"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "id": 1077, "name": "milk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "id": 2047, "name": "salt"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png", "id": 404676, "name": "muffin liners"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed.
