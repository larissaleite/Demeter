Rub a little olive oil over the stew meat pieces, carrots, and onions.  Place stock bones, stew meat or beef scraps, carrots and onions in a large, shallow roasting pan.  Roast in oven for about 45 minutes, turning the bones and meat pieces half-way through the cooking, until nicely browned.  If bones begin to char at all during this cooking process, lower the heat. They should brown, not burn.2 When the bones and meat are nicely browned, remove them and the vegetables and place them in a large (12 to 16 quart) stock pot.  Place the roasting pan on the stove-top on low heat (will cover 2 burners), pour 1/2 cup to a cup of hot water over the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up all of the browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Pour the browned bits and water into the stock pot.3 Add celery tops, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the stock pot.  Fill the stock pot with cold water, to 1 to 2 inches over the top of the bones.  Put the heat on high and bring the pot to a low simmer and then reduce the heat to low.  If you have a candy or meat thermometer, the temperature of the water should be between 180\u00b0 and 200\u00b0F (boiling is 212\u00b0F).  The stock should be at a bare simmer, just a bubble or two coming up here and there.  (You may need to put the pot on your smallest burner on the lowest temp, or if you are using an oven-safe pot, place it in the oven at 190\u00b0F.) Cover the pot loosely and let simmer low and slow for 3-6 hours.  Do not stir the stock while cooking.  Stirring will mix the fats in with the stock, clouding up the stock.4 As the stock cooks, fat will be released from the bone marrow and stew meat and rise to the top.  From time to time check in on the stock and use a large metal spoon to scoop away the fat and any scum that rises to the surface.  (Do not put this fat down your kitchen drain by the way.  It will solidify and block your pipes.  Put it in a bowl or jar to save for cooking or to discard.)5 At the end of cooking time (when you want to end the cooking is up to you, 3 hours minimum, 6 to 8 hours if you can do it) use tongs or a slotted spoon to gently remove the bones and vegetables from the pot (discard them, though if you see a chunk of marrow, taste it, it's delicious).   Line another large pot (8-quart) with a fine mesh sieve, covered with a couple layers of cheesecloth if you have it.  Pour the stock through the sieve to strain it of remaining solids.  Let cool to room temperature then chill in the refrigerator.One the stock has chilled, any fat remaining will have risen to the top and solidified. The fat forms a protective layer against bacteria while the stock is in the refrigerator. If you plan to freeze the stock however, remove and discard the fat, pour the stock into a jar or plastic container. (You can also remove the fat, and boil the stock down, concentrating it so that it doesn't take as much storage space.)  Leave an inch head room from the top of the stock to the top of the jar, so that as the stock freezes and expands, it will not break the container.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-to-make-beef-stock-247003", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "Merry Gourmet", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Classic-Apple-Pie-587330.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 587330, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Classic Apple Pie", "creditText": "Merry Gourmet", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon allspice", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "allspice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/allspice-ground.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2001, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 pounds apples, peeled, cored, and chopped into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apples", "metaInformation": ["cored", "peeled", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9003, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1082047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "Zest of 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons minute tapioca", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "minute tapioca", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tapioca-pearls.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93776, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2025, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Pastry dough for a double crust pie, either homemade or store-bought", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "pastry dough", "metaInformation": ["homemade", "store-bought", "for a double crust pie, either  or "], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dough.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 10018338, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 37.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.merrygourmet.com/2012/10/as-american-as-apple-pie/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 145, "instructions": "Place a baking sheet on middle oven rack, and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.Roll out one piece of pastry dough, keeping remaining piece chilled, on a well-floured surface with a floured rolling pin into at least a 13-inch round, about 1/8-inch thick.

Separate the meat from the bones, NOT the meat from the skin.Using a small pointed and very sharp knife (I used a paring knife), cut around the tail end of the chicken to separate the meat from the bone. Use swift short strokes.Do NOT push the knife too far. Just small nips. As you cut with one hand, use the other the pull the meat away from the bone. When you have about three inches of the back bone exposed, set the knife aside and use your fingers to gently separate the meat from the bone. Just start pushing your fingers inside the chicken, little by little, feeling where the bone is and then inserting your fingers between the meat and the bone.Now, you\u2019ll need the knife again to cut through five areas \u2014 the four joints and the neck bone. The four joints are the two joints separating the thighs from the legs (drumsticks), and the two joints separating the \u201clittle drumstick\u201d (attached to the wings) from the breast.So, just use the knife to cut through the joints. I deboned the thigh but, if you feel more comfortable, you can cut the joint that separates the thigh from the back rather than the joint that separates the thigh from the leg. That way, there\u2019s no need to debone the thigh.Once you\u2019ve cut through the four joints and the neck bone, you can pull off the bony carcass in one piece.Mix together all the ingredients for the marinade.Place the deboned chicken in a resealable bag. Pour in the marinade. Keep in the fridge overnight, turning the bag over after about six hours.Preheat the oven to 375F.Mix together all the ingredients for the stuffing, except the hard-boiled eggs.Take the chicken out of the bag. Stuff the cavity. You\u2019ll have to push the stuffing all the way inside to make sure that every nook and cranny gets stuffed.Now take the three eggs and push them through the stuffing, one after the other.Use wooden toothpicks to seal the opening. In case the skin tore, use toothpicks as well to mend the tear.Place a rack on a baking dish and arrange the chicken on the rack. I originally intended to roast the chicken breast side up but I figured that I wanted the melted bacon fat to fall onto the breast meat so I ended up roasting the chicken breast side down.Roast the chicken at 375F. Depending on the size of the chicken, this can take anywhere from an hour and twenty minutes to an hour and fifty minutes. If you did not debone the thighs, the roasting time would be longer to make sure that the thigh meat is cooked through.Cover the roasted chicken relleno loosely with a foil and cool for at least 15 minutes. Longer is better. In fact, chilling it in the fridge for a couple of hours after cooling will make slicing easier.Slice the chicken and serve. You might want to pour gravy over it but, seriously, ketchup and mayo are fine with me.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-to-cook-chicken-relleno-478297", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 130, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste and Tell Blog", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/lemon-herb-fish-with-crispy-oven-fries-774965.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 774965, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Lemon Herb Fish with Crispy Oven Fries", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Taste and Tell Blog", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh flat-leaf parsley", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11297, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 garlic cloves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd lbs cod or haddock filets, cut into 4 equal pieces", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "haddock filets", "metaInformation": ["cut into 4 equal pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/catfish.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 15033, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "zest of 1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup panko bread crumbs", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "panko bread crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/panko.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10018079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd lbs (about 2 large) russet potatoes, cut into \u00bd inch sticks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "russet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["( 2 large)", "cut into \u00bd inch sticks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 11353, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 82.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteandtellblog.com/lemon-herb-fish-crispy-oven-fries/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 61, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 450F.Put the potato sticks in a large bowl of water and cover with hot tap water.

Cut wings at the joint. Put chicken wing pieces in a plastic bag. Set aside. Food safety note: when cutting raw chicken it is best to use a cutting board reserved just for cutting raw chicken. Wash thoroughly when finished. Do not let raw chicken juices come in contact with other food.2 Create a marinade by stirring together the melted butter, hot pepper sauce, paprika, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the marinade over the chicken pieces in the plastic bag. (Reserve those 2 Tbsp of marinade for coating after the pieces come out of the oven.) Seal bag and let marinate at room temperature for half an hour. When marinating is finished, drain marinade and discard bag.3 Place wing pieces on the rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat for about 10 minutes on each side, until chicken is tender and no longer pink. Remove from oven and baste with the 2 Tbsp of reserved marinade (not the marinade that was in contact with the raw chicken).Serve with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks.Blue cheese dipCombine dip ingredients - sour cream, mayonnaise, blue cheese, vinegar, and garlic - in a blender or food processor.

To make the syrup:                                        Combine 1 cup of water and brown sugar in a heavy medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil until the syrup reduces to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream and cinnamon. Keep the syrup warm. (The syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Re-warm before serving.)To make the bread pudding:Lightly butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking dish. Arrange the bread cubes in prepared dish.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, milk, and sugar to blend. Pour the custard over the bread cubes, and press the bread cubes gently to submerge. Let stand for 30 minutes, occasionally pressing the bread cubes into the custard mixture. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Bake until the pudding puffs and is set in the center, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly.Spoon the bread pudding into bowls, drizzle with the warm Cinnamon Syrup, and serve.

It will harden in the fridge, so when ready to serve, simply blend with a hand mixer on high speed until creamy again.</li></ol>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/carrot-quinoa-muffins-637222", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Recipe Girl", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Parmesan-Crab-Bites-517425.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 517425, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Parmesan Crab Bites", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Recipe Girl", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "rounds of bread or crackers", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "bread", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 18064, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 Tablespoon melted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoon", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup flaked crab meat (fresh will be better than canned, but you can use either)", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "crab meat", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "canned", "flaked", "( will be better than , but you can use either)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crabmeat.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10015136, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 Tablespoon dry white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoon", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14106, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 Tablespoon flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "Tablespoon", "unitShort": "Tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "Tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "onion powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2026, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "shredded fresh Parmesan", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 43.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.recipegirl.com/2007/05/29/parmesan-crab-bites/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 566, "instructions": "1.

Put the cranberries and golden raisins in a small bowl and cover with hot water; set aside to plump for 10 minutes, then drain.2. Put the potato in a medium saucepan, cover with hot water, and add a little salt. Cook over high heat until fork-tender. Meanwhile, put the carrots in a small saucepan, cover with hot water, and add a little salt. Cook over high heat until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and carrots in a strainer and set aside.3. Put the butter in a small saucepan over high heat. Let the butter melt and then stir continuously until the butter starts browning on the bottom of the pan. It will also start bubbling and foaming a little. The butter should have a medium golden-brown color. Immediately pour the butter into a small dish and set aside.4. Smash the soft-cooked potatoes and carrots with a fork or handheld potato masher. You are looking for a lumpy consistency. Stir 6 tablespoons of the brown butter into the vegetables. Blend in the dried fruit and season to taste with salt and pepper.5. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and fit a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.6. To make the strudel, unroll the phyllo dough and lay it flat on a clean work surface. The dimensions of the dough will be 9 by 13 inches, or cut large sheets of phyllo dough to 9 by 13 inches. To help prevent the dough from drying out while working with it, cover with a slightly dampened clean kitchen cloth. Carefully place one sheet of dough on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the melted brown butter, and lightly sprinkle with pecans and coarse sea salt. Lay another sheet on top and continue layering with brown butter, sea salt, and pecans. Layer and stack seven sheets together.7. Carefully spoon the vegetable-dried fruit filling along one of the long edges of the dough, packing it with your hands into a tubelike shape. Starting with the filling side of the dough, roll the strudel tightly into a log. Place the strudel in the center of the baking sheet, brush with the remaining butter, and sprinkle with pecans and a little sea salt.8. Place the strudel in the center of the oven and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove the baking pan from the oven to a cooling rack. Transfer the strudel to a cutting board. With a serrated knife, cut the strudel using long sawing motions. This will help prevent excessive flaking of the pastry.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Poke holes in the sweet potato halves with a fork. Place on a parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet and bake until fork tender, about 1 hour. Alternatively, microwave on high until the flesh is fork tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Set aside.Tie the sage, thyme and rosemary sprigs together with kitchen twine or a clean rubber band and set aside.Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat and cook the bacon, stirring often, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings.Pat the beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Return the Dutch oven to the stovetop on medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the meat on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the broth, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, garlic and herb bundle. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hour on low heat.Uncover and cook at a low simmer until the meat is tender and the vegetables are cooked through, 45 minutes.Scoop out the flesh from the cooked sweet potatoes and place in a blender. Carefully add 1 cup of the stewing liquid and the cashew butter to the blender, then puree until smooth. Add the puree to the stew and stir well. Simmer to thicken, 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Remove the herb bundle and serve the stew garnished with the bacon bits and parsley leaves.                                                                    Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.                                            (c) 2014 Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

When water has come to a rolling boil, add pasta and cook for 5 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. Add kale stems and leaves in a few batches, pressing down with back of large spoon to submerge each batch. Continue cooking, uncovered, over high heat until kale and pasta are tender, about 5 minutes. (Kale tends to remain on top of pasta. Press it under water from time to time with back of large spoon.)3. Drain pasta and kale and return to pot. Add sesame oil and tamari and toss with fork.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients, set aside. In another mixing bowl, mix all wet ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients mixture into the dry ingredients and then use a spatula to mix until just combined. Transfer the cake batter into a cake pan and bake for 30 minutes until a cake tester (such as tooth pick) inserted into the center comes out clean. Place the pan onto a cooling rack and let it stand for 5 minutes before removing the ring. Let it cool completely. Approximate1-1/2 hours.Briefly break the cake by hand. Crush the chunks and blend with coconut flour in a food processor until fine crumbs forms. Pour yogurt into the processor and pulse again.Wear disposable kitchen gloves, divide the cake-yogurt dough into 18 pieces, and roll each ball between palms to form smooth balls. Place the cake balls onto a parchment paper lined baking dish and freeze the cake balls for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, cut the baking chocolate into small chunks and then place the chunks into a microwave-proof bowl. Heat in microwave for 50 seconds and stir every 10 seconds. When the chocolate is melted, add the remaining chocolate shell ingredients and stir until smooth. It should be thick and somewhat runny.Use two forks to roll each cake ball in the chocolate until completely covered. Scoop the ball out with the fork and let the ball rest on the fork for a few seconds in order to drip off the extra chocolate. Carefully nudge the chocolate coated cake ball onto the parchment paper or wax paper lined dish. Refrigerate until the chocolate shell is hardened. Store in refrigerator and serve cold.

minutes, flipping about halfway through; transfer to a plate.

Add the burgers to the skillet over high heat. Cook for 3 minutes, flip and cook for 3 minutes more for medium-rare.Lay 1 lettuce \"bun\" cut side up on each of two plates and top with a burger. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the dressing over each burger and top with 1 tablespoon of the onion. Crumble 1 piece of bacon over each burger and top with the remaining lettuce buns.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Add the melted butter and heavy cream. Stir together, moistening the dry ingredients with the butter and cream. If the mixture doesn't hold it's shape when pressed together, add another tablespoon of butter until it can do so. Reserve 1/4 cup of the graham crust and dump the rest into a 10-inch pie tin. With your fingers and the palms of your hands, press the crust firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie tin, covering the bottom and sides of the pan completely.Heat the chocolate and butter together in a large microwave-safe bowl for about 50 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir them together, working until the mixture is glossy and smooth. (Heat for another 15-20 seconds at a time if not totally melted.)Combine the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip together on high for 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy and pale yellow and has reached the ribbon state. (Detach your whisk, dunk it into the whipped eggs, and wave it back and forth like a pendulum: the mixture should form a thickened, silky ribbon that falls and then disappears into the batter.) If the mixture does not form ribbons, continue whipping on high as needed.Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment. Dump the chocolate mixture into the eggs and briefly mix together on low, then increase the speed to medium and paddle the mixture for 1 minute, or until it is brown and completely homogenous. If there are any dark streaks of chocolate, paddle for a few seconds longer, or as needed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and paddle on low speed for 45 to 60 seconds. There should be no clumps of dry ingredients. If there are any lumps, mix for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Stream in the heavy cream on low speed, mixing for 30 to 45 seconds, just until the batter has loosened up a little and the white streaks of cream are fully mixed in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Detach the paddle and remove the bowl from the mixer. Gently fold in the 45 g (1/4 cup) graham crust with a spatula. (These crumbs will add little bursts of flavor and texture into the pie filling.)Grab a sheet pan and put your pie tin of graham crust on it. With a spatula, scrape the brownie batter into the graham shell. Bake for 25 minutes. The pie should puff slightly on the sides and develop a sugary crust on top. If the brownie pie is still liquid in the center and has not formed a crust, bake it for an additional 5 minutes or so.Cool the pie on a rack. (You can speed up the cooling process by carefully transferring the pie to the fridge or freezer directly out of the oven if you\u2019re in a hurry.) Wrapped in plastic, the pie will keep fresh in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/milk-bar-monday-fudgy-brownie-pie-570914", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Idaho-Spudnuts-466069.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 466069, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Idaho Spudnuts", "preparationMinutes": 40, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "active yeast", "metaInformation": ["dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18375, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 4582, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 cups confectioners' sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "confectioners' sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19336, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "7-1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 7.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1-1/2 cups warm milk (110\u00b0 to 115\u00b0)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["(110\u00b0 to 115\u00b0)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and quartered", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "russet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "quartered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11353, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Additional oil for deep-fat frying", "aisle": "?", "name": "additional oil", "metaInformation": ["for deep-fat frying"], "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 48.0, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 19.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/idaho-spudnuts", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 429, "instructions": "Directions                                                                                Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water.

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (150\u00b0C).2. In a mixing bowl, stir the sugar, oil, cayenne, and cumin until well mixed. Add the walnuts and toss until thoroughly coated.3. Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until fragrant and slightly darker in color. Stir them at least once to promote even cooking, and take care they do not burn. Let the walnuts cool and then chop them coarsely.4. The spiced nuts can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.Make the pears5. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).6. In a shallow baking dish that will hold the pear halves in one layer, combine the wine, orange juice, honey, butter, vanilla bean, cinnamon stick, and pepper. Mix thoroughly.7. Rub each pear half with lemon juice to prevent browning and put them, cut sides down, in the baking dish. Spoon some of the wine-orange mixture over each pear and cover the dish with parchment paper.8. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the pears are tender when pierced with a small, sharp knife. Do not overcook or they will fall apart. Carefully transfer the pears to a plate or cutting board and let them cool to room temperature.9. Meanwhile, pour the baking juices into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 1/4 cup or the consistency of a light syrup.

Grease three 6-inch round cake pans and line with unbleached parchment paper. Don't skip this step if you want the cakes to come out of the pans. Alternatively you can use two 8-inch cake pans instead of three 6-inch ones.Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla to your food processor and pulse until smooth. You can also use a blender. Add the quinoa and sugar and combine. Incorporate the remainder of the ingredients and pulse until all of the ingredients are mixed together. This step shouldn't take long, 30 seconds at most.Divide the batter between the 3 cake pans and bake for 20-22 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the baking pans for at least 20 minutes. Invert them onto cooling wire racks, remove the parchment paper and let the cakes cool completely.For the frosting, in a safe microwave plate, place the white chocolate chips and melt in 45 second intervals stirring in between until the chocolate has melted. Place the cream cheese and wild berries, reserve the 1 tbsp, into your food processor and pulse until combine. Add the melted chocolate chips to the food processor and pulse until all of the ingredients are mixed together. Place the frosting in the fridge for about 30 minutes while the cakes are cooling down to set up the frosting.To assemble the cake. Place one cake layer onto your desired serving dish and top with on third of the frosting spreading it evenly to the edge of the cake. Place another cake layer over the frosting and spread another one third of the frosting over the cake in the same manner. Place the last cake layer over the frosting and use the reaming frosting to frost the last layer. Arrange the reserved wild berries over the frosting.If using alternative frosting instead blend the coconut cream and maple syrup and refrigerate until firm. About 1 hour. Spread over cake layers like instructions above and arrange the reserved wild berries over the frosting.You can keep the cake refrigerated for up to 4-5 days.Recipe adapted from Mel's Kitchenoriginally from Quinoa 365", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-quinoa-cake-gluten-free-553186", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simple Bites", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/How-I-learned-to-cook-whole-fish--Sicilian-style-(and-how-you-can-too)-502374.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 502374, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "How I learned to cook whole fish, Sicilian style (and how you can too)", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Simple Bites", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Handful chopped fresh basil leaves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "basil leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "Handful", "unitShort": "Handful", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "Handful"}, {"originalString": "1 cup breadcrumbs", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "breadcrumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Several cloves chopped or crushed garlic", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cloves", "metaInformation": ["crushed", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002011, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1/2 chopped red onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["red", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Sea salt and olive oil", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea-salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup sharp white cheese, grated (mine was pecorino, but any sharp cheese would work)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "sharp cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["white", "grated", "(mine was pecorino, but any sharp cheese would work)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1031009, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 chopped tomatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11529, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 whole white fish (these were mid-sized)", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "white fish", "metaInformation": ["whole", "white", "(these were mid-sized)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fish-fillet.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 10115261, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 59.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.simplebites.net/how-i-learned-to-cook-whole-fish-sicilian-style-and-how-you-can-too/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 61, "instructions": "Warm up olive oil on medium heat in a frying pan.

First, spread olive oil over the parchment, then lay the fish down head-to-tail so that they fit well.Bake at 375 for approximately 10 min. per inch of thickness. This is just a general rule. Set your timer for 10 minutes and start checking in 5 minute intervals from that point forward. Avoiding overcooking is key. Test with a fork to see if the fish flakes when you open it. Another key for me was noticing that the gill area burst open slightly and I could see a little cooked white flesh coming out.Drizzle lightly with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt after removing from the oven.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-i-learned-to-cook-whole-fish-sicilian-style-and-how-you-can-too-502374", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Corny-Lettuce-Salad-408874.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 408874, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Corny Lettuce Salad", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "cider vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup fresh or frozen corn, thawed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh corn", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "thawed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-on-the-cob.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 11167, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon ground mustard", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground mustard", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dry-mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002024, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 cups shredded lettuce", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11252, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon grated onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11282, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1-1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "poppy seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/poppyseed.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2033, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup finely chopped sweet red pepper", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red sweet pepper", "metaInformation": ["red", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11821, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 4513, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 27.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/corny-lettuce-salad", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 30, "instructions": "Directions                                                                                In a salad bowl, toss the lettuce and corn.
