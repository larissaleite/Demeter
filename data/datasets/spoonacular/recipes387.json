Then toss in your brussel sprouts.Sprinkle some salt and pepper over the brussel sprouts and let them sit for a couple minutes until they begin to burn just a bit.Use a spoon or a flip of your wrist to turn the brussel sprouts over to cook on the other side.Once the brussel sprouts have been flipped, add in a tablespoon of water and cover the pan with a lid. Keep an eye on them, being sure to move them around once more so the little guys don\u2019t stick to the pan.While the brussel sprouts finish cooking, add a medium skillet over medium-high heat.Add your piece of bacon that has been cut in half to the pan. As soon as the fat begins to render out into the pan, add the sliced chicken sausage.Once your bacon is ready to flip, flip the bacon along with the sausage to cook on opposite side.When your brussel sprouts are soft enough to stick a fork through, remove from heat, salt and pepper once more, then place in bowl.Top with your cooked bacon and sausage.Done and done.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/my-new-go-to-meal-509388", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 20, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/turkey_with_melted_camembert_and_mostarda-75151.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 75151, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Turkey With Melted Camembert And Mostarda", "pricePerServing": 399.44, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup arugula", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "arugula", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11959, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "6 slices (4 ozs) Camembert cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "camembert cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/camembert.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1007, "unit": "ozs"}, {"originalString": "1/4 to \u00bd cup mostarda, or to taste", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "cup cake", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/plain-cupcake.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18139, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 (4-inch) sections crusty French baguette, halved", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "french baguette", "metaInformation": ["halved"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/half-baguette.jpg", "unitLong": "inches", "unitShort": "inch", "amount": 8.0, "id": 18033, "unit": "inch"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbsps mayonnaise", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mayonnaise", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsps", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4025, "unit": "Tbsps"}, {"originalString": "Olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Sandwich assembly", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "sandwich bun", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/kaiser-roll.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18353, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "10 ozs sliced turkey breast", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "turkey breast", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turkey-breast.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 5696, "unit": "ozs"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 70.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-sandwich-rec2-20111124,0,1212994.story", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 17, "analyzedInstructions": [], "aggregateLikes": 18, "instructions": null, "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/turkey-with-melted-camembert-and-mostarda-75151", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Averie Cooks", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Caramel-Apple-Cinnamon-Bars-608381.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 608381, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Caramel Apple Cinnamon Bars", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 533.06, "creditText": "Averie Cooks", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 medium/large apple, sliced into 1/8-inch slices, about 12 to 15 thin slices (I used 1 unpeeled Fuji)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apple", "metaInformation": ["unpeeled", "sliced into 1/8-inch slices, 12 to 15 thin slices (i used 1  fuji)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9003, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 medium/large apples, grated (about 1 1/2 cups grated apples measured loosely, not packed.

Add the sugar and continue to cream for approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the flour and milk, alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Add the vanilla and continue to mix until incorporated. To bake 6 layers of cake 3 at a time, divide the batter in 1/2, then divide each 1/2 among the 3 pans. Level the batter in each pan by dropping pan flat onto counter top to release air bubbles. Bake each cake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool in pans for 5 to 10 minutes. Invert cakes and repeat process with the rest of the cake batter.Prepare frosting while cakes are cooling. Mix sugar, cocoa, butter, half-and-half, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil. Continue to boil, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes. The syrup will become thick. Remove syrup from heat, and beat in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer. Allow frosting to rest for a couple of minutes.

Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.for the whipped vanilla buttercream:- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium-high speed until smooth.  Add the confectioners sugar and mix on medium-low until incorporated.- Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean into the bowl and add the salt.  Beat again on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2-3 minutes.- Mix in the heavy cream and vanilla extract and beat until just incorporated.  Then, increase the mixer speed to high and whip until light and fluffy, scraping down the bowl as necessary, for about 5 minutes.- Transfer frosting to a decorating bag fit with a large star tip and pipe swirls on each cooled cupcake.   for the chocolate shells:- In separate containers, melt the white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate until smooth.  I prefer to do this in the microwave by heating the chocolate in 30 second intervals, mixing vigorously between each interval until completely melted.- Transfer the chocolate to a squeeze bottle or large Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off in layers, alternating between layers of white and semi-sweet chocolate.- Fill up the molds, scrape them so theyre al filled evenly, and transfer to the freezer for 5-10 minutes until the chocolate is set.  Remove chocolates from the mold and continue making shells until youve got 24!  Top each cupcake with a chocolate shell.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-cupcakes-with-whipped-vanilla-buttercream-and-chocolate-shells-602338", "dishTypes": ["dessert"],
