If you have a mixer, just put on the dough hook and let it work until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. It should form a soft ball after about 4 or 5 minutes.3) Without a mixer, to simulate a dough hook, dip your hand in a cup of water every few minutes and use it to mix the dough vigorously. After a few minutes it comes together in a nice ball. This dough does not need to pass the windowpane test.4) After 5 minutes or so of kneading, transfer the dough to a bowl that has been coated with vegetable oil and turn it a few times to coat the dough ball with oil. Cover it and let it sit at room temperature for 60 minutes to rise.5) Take the dough and divide it evenly (a dough cutter is helpful here) into 8 pieces. Each piece should weigh about 4 ounces.6) Roll the dough out into about a 2 foot strip, starting from the center and rolling out gently. If it isnt stretching you can hold the dough by both ends and gently whip it up and down. It will loosen up the gluten a bit. Then take the left end and wrap it to the center and then overlay the right side. Then kind of adjust it so it's pretzel-like.7) Bring the water and baking soda to a rolling boil and gently lay in a pretzel, one or two at a time. Youll need a pretty good sized pot. The pretzel will float and after about 30 seconds, flip it over in the water with a spatula to get the other side. Then after another 30 gently lift it out and place it on a parchment lined baking sheet, ready to go for the oven.8) Once the pretzels come out of the boil, brush them with some egg wash (1 egg and 1 Tablespoon water) and then sprinkle them generously with the pretzel salt.9) Bake at 450 degrees for about 14 minutes. 10) Immediately move them to a cooling rack.11) After they cool you can pile them high on a plate.

Cook until mushrooms are completely tender (a cake tester or paring knife inserted should meet little resistance as it goes through), about 30 minutes, flipping mushrooms once halfway through cooking.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Remove mushrooms from liquid and dry carefully with paper towels. Return remaining liquid to a gently boil over medium heat and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. When mushrooms are cool enough to handle, slice each into 12 disks about 1/2-inch wide.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Heat oil in a large wok, saucepan, or deep fryer to 350\u00b0F and adjust flame to maintain temperature.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Combine cornstarch and flour in a large bowl and stir with chopsticks until roughly combined. Add soda and stir very rapidly with chopsticks while shaking bowl. Do not overmix\u2014there should be plenty of lumps and bubbles. Add sliced mushrooms to bowl and turn to coat. Working one piece at a time, lift mushroom, allow excess batter to drip off, then slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat until all mushrooms are in the oil. Cook mushrooms, agitating oil and turning mushrooms occasionally with a wire mesh spider or long chopsticks until pale golden brown and completely crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt immediately.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Place steamed buns on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high power until hot, about 1 minute. Spread miso mayonnaise in each steamed bun, then add shredded lettuce, two fried mushroom slices, a drizzle of the reduced simmering liquid, sliced scallions, and cilantro leaves.
