In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, bouillon and ginger. Drain pineapple into a 2-cup measuring cup; set pineapple aside. Add enough cold water to juice to measure 1-1/4 cups. Stir in vinegar and soy sauce. Gradually whisk into sugar mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.                                                                                           Pour sauce over chicken; top with green pepper  and reserved pineapple. Bake, uncovered, at 350\u00b0 for 20-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 170\u00b0. Serve with rice.                                        Yield: 6 servings.
