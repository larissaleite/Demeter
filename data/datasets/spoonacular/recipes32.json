(Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if onions are browning too quickly.)Cut baguette into 4 equal lengths. Split each piece in half horizontally. Pull out the soft bread from the center of each piece, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shells. Place soft bread in a food processor or blender and process to form fine crumbs. Measure out 1/2 cup of crumbs (reserve the rest for another use).Mash garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt with the side of a chef's knife. Transfer to a medium bowl. (Alternatively, mash garlic and salt in a mortar with a pestle.) Add reserved egg yolk and mash with a fork. Whisk in mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, anchovy paste and remaining 1 teaspoon oil.

After removing the pan from the oven, use a shot glass to press the crusts down a bit to make more of an indentation for the filling. Let the cookie cups cool for 10 minutes in the pan and then use a knife to help dislodge them from the pan. The bottoms of the cookie cups will be very soft but will harden as they cool. Let the cookie cups cool completely before filling. To prepare the filling, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until fluffy. Beat in the melted white chocolate and once well combined, stir in the Greek yogurt. The mixture will be quite thin. Refrigerate for about 30-60 minutes or until firm. Spoon 2 tablespoons of filling into each cup. Decorate with berries and serve or refrigerate first for 2 hours for a firmer filling. If making these in advance, add the berries the day of serving.

In a small bowl, mix the dried fruits, walnuts, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns. Add the wine and lemon juice, cover, and let soak for up to 2 days in a cool place or in the refrigerator.2. Transfer the fruits in the soaking liquid to a non-reactive saucepan set over low heat and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain the fruits, reserving the liquid for use in Step 7 below. Discard the whole spices. Cut the fruits into 1/2-inch dice. Set aside until needed.Make the pot roast3. In large glass or plastic container, combine the dissolved salt, sugar, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, and 3 cups cold water. Add the pork, cover or seal, and let marinate in the brine for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.4. About 4 hours before serving, drain the pork loin; discard the brine. Wipe the meat to remove excess moisture. Crush the garlic with a pinch each salt and pepper. Mix with 1 tablespoon of the orange zest and 1 teaspoon water to make a paste. Make deep slits all over the pork; press the garlic paste into the slits. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.5. Preheat the oven to 350F (175C).6. Heat the oil in a shallow enameled cast-iron roasting pan or gratin dish over medium-high heat. Dust the pork with flour, shaking off excess. When the oil starts to sizzle lightly, add the pork and cook, turning, until the roast is brown all over, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.7. Add 1/4 cup water and scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Scatter the green grapes on the bottom. Set the pork, fat side up, on top. Place in the oven to cook for 45 minutes.8. Turn the pork loin over and continue to roast, uncovered, until the internal temperature registers 145F (63C), about 15 minutes. Remove the pork loin, cover with foil, and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours.9. Skim the fat from the liquid in the pan. Set over medium-high heat, add the juices from the fruit compote, and boil until they start to thicken and shine, about 10 minutes. Add the vinegar and season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Pour all but 2 tablespoons sauce into a bowl. Add the fruits from the compote to the pan and cook over medium-high heat until they lightly caramelize. Return the pork to the pan, turn to coat with the syrupy juices, and cook over medium-low heat until completely reheated, about 15 minutes. The internal temperature should be 150 to 155F (65C).10. Lift the pork loin out of the pan, allowing excess sauce to drip back into the pan. Thinly slice and arrange the pork over the fruits. Dribble the sauce over the pork and scatter the remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest and the parsley on top.

                                   For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F.

egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium-low speed until whites begin to loosen and froth, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and beat whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add the sugar and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Add egg yolks and beat just until combined. Decrease speed to low and add flour mixture in three batches, alternating with milk. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary. Add vanilla and beat just until combined. Fold in coconut with rubber spatula.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Scrape batter into ungreased 13- by 9-inch baking dish and smooth out top. Bake until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes, rotating cake halfway through baking. Transfer cake to cooling rack and cool in pan completely, 1 to 2 hours. Once cooled, poke cake all over with fork or skewer and run a paring knife along the edges just to separate the cake from the sides of the baking dish.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            For the Coconut Milk Bath: Whisk coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and cream together in large bowl. Pour mixture evenly all over cake (See notes). Transfer to refrigerator and chill at least 2 hours.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            For the Toasted Meringue Topping: Stir sugar, water, and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil syrup until it registers 240\u00b0F on candy thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            While syrup boils, in large bowl, beat egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium-low speed until whites begin to loosen and froth, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and beat whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            With mixer running on medium-high speed, slowly and carefully add syrup to egg whites. Beat until outside of bowl is cool to the touch and whites are thick and glossy, about 7 minutes. Fold in toasted coconut.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Spread topping on cooled cake with a spatula, pulling up on meringue to create decorative peaks.

                                                                 For the Basic Pasta Dough: Put the flour, eggs, and egg yolks in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the dough comes together. Turn off the mixer, remove the paddle attachment, and replace it with the dough hook. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat the dough with the dough hook on medium speed until it forms a ball, about 5 minutes. Dust a flat work surface with flour. Turn the dough out onto the dusted surface and gently knead it for 20 to 25 minutes, until the ball begins to feel elastic and the surface of the dough feels smooth and silky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate to rest for at least 45 minutes and up to overnight before sheeting it (any longer and the dough will discolor).                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To make the Ravioli: Combine the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a medium bowl, and sprinkle with the salt, sugar, and nutmeg. Stir to combine the seasonings with the cheese. Stir in the cream, adding more if necessary to obtain the consistency of soft- serve ice cream. (You can make the filling up to two days in advance. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the ravioli.) Scoop up 1/3 cup of the ricotta filling and form it into a disk about 1/2 inch high and 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Set the disk on a plate and repeat, forming the remaining ricotta into a total of 8 disks. Set them aside while you prepare the dough for the ravioli.\u00a0                                                                                                                            3                                                                            To make the ravioli, cut eight 4-inch square pieces of parchment and dust two baking sheets with semolina. Roll the dough out to the third thinnest setting on a pasta sheeter (number 6 using a KitchenAid attachment), stacking the sheets of dough on one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. When you have rolled out all of the dough, dust a flat work surface with flour and lay one sheet of the\u00a0dough on the floured surface. Place three or four ricotta disks on the dough, leaving 4 inches between each disk and 1 1/2 to 2 inches of dough on all the sides of the outer disks. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to make a crater deep enough to hold an egg yolk in the center of each disk. Separate one egg, reserving the white and carefully sliding the yolk into one crater. Repeat, filling the remaining 2 or 3 disks in the same way (you don\u2019t need to reserve any more whites).                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Lay a second sheet of dough directly behind the first and use a rolling pastry cutter, starting at the edge of the dough nearest your body and moving in a straight line directly away from you, making one long cut through both sheets of dough between two disks of ricotta. Continue making cuts down the sheet of dough between the disks. Using a pastry brush, brush egg white around each cheese disk. Lift one segment of dough from the back sheet and lay it on top of the corresponding front segment of dough. Without lifting the raviolo, cup both hands around the cheese so that the edges of your pinky fingers press down around the cheese, sealing the raviolo closed. Repeat, covering and sealing the remaining ravioli. Use a 3 \u00d7 3 inch fluted cookie cutter or fluted pastry wheel to cut each raviolo, discarding the scraps of dough around it. Place the ravioli on the prepared baking sheet and repeat, assembling the remaining ravioli in the same way. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to boil them, or for up to 8 hours.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Fill two wide pots with 6 quarts of water each. Add 6 tablespoons of salt to each pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Have a slotted spatula or slotted spoon and a clean dishtowel handy for lifting the ravioli out of the water.\u00a0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            While the water is coming to a boil, make the brown butter sauce. Place the butter and sage leaves in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to brown the butter evenly and prevent it from burning, until the bubbles subside and the butter is dark brown with a nutty, toasty smell. Reduce the heat to low to keep the butter warm while you cook the pasta.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Remove the ravioli from the refrigerator and, one at a time, lift the parchment holding each raviolo off the baking sheet and gently drop the raviolo with the paper into the water, adding 4 ravioli to each pot. (The parchment will quickly separate and will be easy to remove from the water.) When you have dropped all the ravioli, remove and discard the parchment paper, partially cover the pots to return the water to a boil quickly, and keep it boiling. Cook the ravioli for 4 minutes. With a clean dishtowel in one hand and a slotted spoon or spatula in the other, lift one raviolo out of the water and onto the dishtowel to blot it dry, and then carefully place it in the center of a dinner plate.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Repeat with the remaining ravioli. Pour the brown butter over the ravioli, dividing it evenly. Place one of the sage leaves on top of each raviolo, discarding the remaining leaves. Use a microplane or another fine grater to grate a light dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano over each raviolo, and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans with oil and dust with flour. Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a small bowl; set aside.Microwave the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl on high power for 45 seconds; remove and stir. Microwave again at high power in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate has melted completely; set aside.Beat the granulated sugar, oil and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the melted chocolate. Alternate beating in the flour mixture and the milk, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just incorporated. Add half the milk, and mix until just incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and milk, making sure not to overmix. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, run a thin spatula around the edges and then turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. (They will have a sugary \"crust\" on the top. This is from the melted chocolate and is not a problem. It will soften once the cake is assembled or if the layers are baked the day before.)For the filling: While the cakes cool, spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake, tossing once, until toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Finely chop. Whisk together the milk and egg yolks in a medium saucepan until smooth. Add the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. (It will be similar to the thickness of eggnog.) Pour the mixture into a large bowl. (Don't worry if it seems thin. The coconut and nuts will bind it.) Stir in the coconut and pecans; set aside to cool.For the frosting: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat 1 cup of the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not boiling, and pour over the chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, and then whisk until smooth; let stand at room temperature (or put in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot) until thick but not set, 20 minutes to 1 hour. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream to the chocolate mixture, and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until lightened in color and fluffy, about 1 minute (do not overbeat, or it will become hard and grainy). The frosting should hold medium peaks and will continue to firm up a bit as it stands. Spoon about 1 cup frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.To assemble: Put one cake layer right-side up on a serving plate, and top with half the filling. Top with the second cake layer and the remaining filling, spreading it to about 1/2 inch from the edge. Frost the sides, and decorate around the top edge of the cake with the frosting in the pastry bag.Loosely cover the cake with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature overnight. Unwrap and serve.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Combine cornmeal, pastry flour, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to incorporate. Add butter and oil and pulse about 20 times, until mixture resembles small pebbles. Add water and pulse until mixture forms a loose dough. Remove dough from processor and press into bottom and about 1/8-inch up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a detachable rim. Press aluminum foil into the bottom and sides of the pan on top of the dough and weigh down with uncooked rice or pie weights. Place tart pan on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and remove rice and foil. Return to oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until no longer shiny and wet. Remove from oven and let cool.For the filling: Increase the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat; saute shallots until soft, about 5 to 6 minutes. Spray 2 baking trays with cooking spray. Arrange the eggplant, zucchini and tomato slices on the trays in a single layer and brush with the remaining olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and roast the vegetables until soft but not browned, about 15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from oven and cool.Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Lay the eggplant slices in 2 layers on the bottom of tart; cover with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese and some of the shredded basil. Add the zucchini and shallots, top with another 1/3 of the mozzarella and basil, then the tomatoes. Top with rest of the mozzarella cheese and the Parmesan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and vegetables have further wilted. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, and cut into 8 slices. Serve warm.

the 4 apples. Using a melon baller or spoon, dig out the insides of the apples and reserve, leaving 1/4 inch flesh next to the skin. Remove the cores and seeds and discard.Coarsely chop the scooped fruit and add it to a medium bowl; you should have at least 1 1/2 cups. If not, peel, core and dice the additional apple and add it to the bowl. Sprinkle the lemon juice over top and toss to coat. Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt to the bowl and mix. Divide the filling among the hollowed-out apples.Roll out the pie crust and using a pastry wheel, cut it into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Brush a light coating of egg wash along the top edge of each apple. Weave the strips into a lattice atop each apple, using the egg wash to adhere (see Cook's Note). Lightly brush the top of each lattice with the egg wash.Place the apples in an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Add 1 inch of water to the bottom of the dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbling, an additional 25 minutes. Place the apples on a cooling rack to cool to room temperature before serving.                                                            Alternatively, you can cut a circle 1 inch larger in diameter than the top of each apple and use a small cutter to cut shapes for venting, or simply cut a few slits. Then brush the edges of the apples with the egg wash, and gently press the dough edges with the back of a fork to adhere.

Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium low and stir in the rice, smashed garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender, 16 to 18 minutes; set aside.Meanwhile, toss the poblano, onion, pear, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil, stirring occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, 8 minutes; set aside.Season the pork with salt, pepper and the thyme. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork; cook until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate. Add the poblano mixture and sliced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the garlic softens, 2 minutes. Add the broth and cook, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Remove from the heat; stir in the vinegar and half of the cilantro. Season with salt.Fluff the rice, discard the smashed garlic and stir in the remaining cilantro. Season with salt. Serve with the pork and poblano mixture.Photograph by Charles Masters                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:
