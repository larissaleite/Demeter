Cover remaining wrappers with plastic or a moist clean kitchen towel. Add a half dozen carrot/daikon sticks, 1 cucumber stick, 1 jalape\u00f1o stick, and a few leaves/stems of cilantro in a bundle in the lower third of the wrapper, keeping it in a nice, tight row. Roll from the bottom corner towards the top, keeping everything nice and tight. Roll until nearly half way up, then stop.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The next step is to fold the left and right corners towards the center. Start by first pressing in on the edges of the filling with your fingertips to make sure it's packed nice and tight. Fold the corners towards the center, again keeping everything tight. Moistening the edges of the wrapper with a bit of water will help it stick to itself and keep its shape.You want the bottom edge to form a 90\u00b0 angle with the new edge you've just created by folding over the corner.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After both corners have been folded in, continue rolling towards the top of the paper. Moisten the top corner of the wrapper with a bit of water and continue rolling until the entire package is sealed. Repeat with remaining rolls until all the filling is used up. Finished rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months in a sealed container. If freezing, fry directly from the freezer, adding 1 minute to cook time.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            To Make The Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside. Sauce will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            To Serve: Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 325\u00b0F as registered on an instant read thermometer. Add 10 to 15 rolls and cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes.

Line 2 standard muffin tins with cupcake liners.</p><p>In a small bowl, combine the flours and set aside.</p><p>In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.</p><p>Mix the milk and vanilla together in a small bowl.</p><p>Add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla mixture. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not overbeat.</p><p>Carefully spoon the batter into the cupcake liners.  With my small cookie scoop, I used two scoops-worth into each baking cup to fill about 2/3s of the way full. Bake in the middle of the oven until tops turn golden brown and toothpick or cake-tester comes out clean, about 18-20 minutes.</p><p>Cool the cupcakes in tins for about 15 minutes. Remove from the tins and cool completely on a wire rack before icing.</p><p>While the cupcakes are cooling, place all the ganache ingredients in a glass bowl that you can place over a boiling saucepan of water, acting as a double boiler. Stir constantly until all ingredients and melted and incorporated. Dip tops of cupcakes into ganache and set aside to set while preparing buttercream.</p><p>{for buttercream}</p><p>In a food processor, puree fresh strawberries until smooth. Add 2 Tablespoons of sugar, mix together, and set aside.</p><p>Over a pot of simmering water, create a double boiler with the bowl of your stand mixer (or the bowl you will be mixing your buttercream in). Whisk egg whites and sugar into the bowl over simmering water. Continue mixing for about 5 minutes, or until all sugar is dissolved.</p><p>With whisk attachment of your stand mixer on high, whisk until egg whites form stiff peaks and the bowl is completely cooled. This will take quite awhile  about 15 minutes.</p><p>One square at a time, add butter while the mixer is continually mixing. Continue to do this until all butter is mixed in. Add vanilla.
