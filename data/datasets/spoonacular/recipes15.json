a single layer in a roasting pan. Pour the olive oil over them and turn to coat well. Sprinkle with the salt and 1-2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary (I used 1 tablespoon), turn the potatoes again and tuck in a few fresh rosemary sprigs. Roast until the skins are slightly wrinkled and the insides are tender and creamy when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 45 minutes.Meanwhile, place the salmon on in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl whisk together the maple syrup, bourbon, soy sauce, orange juice and cayenne pepper. Pour the sauce over the salmon. Let that sit for a little while you prepare the chutney.In a medium size sauce pot, combine the cranberries, apples, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, orange zest, ginger, cinnamon stick and jalapeno (if using). Pour in 1 cup water and bring the mixture to boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer 20-25 minutes or until the sauce has reduced and thickened and the cranberries have burst. Taste and add more brown sugar if needed. Remove from the heat to cool.While the chutney is cooking, cook the salmon. Heat a medium size skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Remove the salmon from the bourbon-maple mixture and carefully add to the hot skillet, skin side facing up. Sear the salmon for 3-4 minutes and then flip and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes or until the salmon reaches your desired doneness. Cooking times will vary depending on the size of your salmon. Remove the salmon from the skillet and place on a plate.Reduce the heat to low and carefully pour in all of the bourbon-Maple mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until thickened by half and the sauce is syrupy. Remove from the heat and drizzle the hot glaze over the salmon, reserving some of the glaze for serving.To serve, place a little cranberry chutney on the bottom of a plate. Place the salmon on top of the the chutney and drizzle the salmon again with the bourbon-maple glaze. Add the potatoes to the side of the plate.

Divide the pastry into 6. Then assemble tarts one by one. Halve a chunk of pastry and roll out each halve to a circle about the thickness of a 50p piece on a floured surface. Spoon a sixth of the filling into the centre of one circle in a pile. Brush edges with egg, and lift the second pastry circle on top. Gently press down on the fruit to push out as much air as you can. Press the pastry edges to seal. Use an appropriate sized bowl, glass etc to help you trim the edges to a neat circle. At this stage, you can cover and chill the tarts overnight, or freeze for 1 month. Defrost before continuing. Brush with beaten egg, then make three small slashes with a knife in a row.

in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons ice water and gently stir with a fork until incorporated.

With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to distribute fat. Gather dough together, with a pastry or bench scraper if you have one, and form into a 6-inch disk. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.

Sprinkle semolina evenly over dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around, then arrange pineapple wedges on dough, overlapping them slightly, in 3 lengthwise rows. Brush pineapple with melted butter. Mix together sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over pineapple. Fold border of dough inward over outer edge of pineapple and brush with milk.

Add the chicken broth, garlic, and tomatoes and simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sauce is very deep red in color. Transfer (half at a time - it's a lot of sauce) to a blender, puree, and set aside. Taste and adjust for saltiness as needed.CHICKEN: Coat the chicken breasts with the seasoning. Heat the pan from step one over medium low heat with a little oil and add the chicken. Cook for a few minutes on each side until nicely browned. Cover with sauce and simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes so the chicken finishes cooking gently in the sauce. Remove chicken from sauce and shred with two forks. Set aside.ASSEMBLE: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Dip five tortillas in the warm sauce and layer in the bottom of a 9-inch round skillet or baking dish. Add a scoop of chicken, a handful of cheese, and about  cup sauce. Repeat layer. End with one more layer of tortillas, a scoop of sauce, and cheese. (And now go make another one! You should be able to make two pies with this recipe.)BAKE:  Cover with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick oil to prevent it from sticking on the cheese.

medium bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just incorporated.Transfer half of the dough to a separate bowl and stir in the lemon zest and juice. Beat the molasses, ginger, cinnamon and allspice into the remaining dough. Lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap. Drop alternating spoonfuls of the two doughs onto the plastic to form an 11-by-8-inch rectangle. Use the plastic to roll the dough into a 2-by-11-inch log, twisting the ends closed. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the dough into 1/2-inch-thick rounds and arrange about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets; sprinkle with sanding sugar. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the edges of the cookies are set, 14 to 18 minutes. Let cool 2 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

Let the vegetables crisp while you prepare the rest of the salad. Place the almond slivers on a small baking sheet and toast at 350 degrees F (180 C) until golden brown. They\u2019ll go from just right to burnt in a matter of seconds, so keep a close watch on their progress. Transfer the almonds to a small bowl. Lay the wonton wrappers on a flat surface and use a pastry brush to generously brush one surface with olive oil. Use a sharp knife to slice them into 1/4-inch strips and give each strip a twirl before placing them on the baking sheet and baking until the wontons are golden brown and crunchy. In a medium pot with a lid, bring 8 cups of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a rolling boil. Add the chicken tenders to the pot, cover with the lid and then turn off the heat. Poach until the chicken reads an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (about 10 minutes). The time it takes to cook will vary depending on the size of the chicken. While the chicken is cooking, prepare a bowl of ice water. When the chicken is done, drain it and add the chicken to the ice water to stop the cooking. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it and set it aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger juice, salt, mustard and white pepper until emulsified. Drain the salad greens and run them through a salad spinner, patting any remaining water off with paper towels. Add the greens to a dry bowl. Toss the salad with the sesame seeds and 2/3rds of the dressing and then place it in a serving bowl or platter. Top with the almonds, chicken, baked wonton wrappers and pour the remaining dressing on top.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, rosemary and lemon zest. Pour in the olive oil and stir until all of the dry mixture is incorporated.Transfer the dough to a 9 by 9-inch baker (my porcelain one didn't require greasing, but you might want to grease your pan first to be safe). Use your fingers to squish the dough into an even layer. Prick the surface of the dough all over with a fork (a diagonal pattern looks nice).

Place the racks in the center position. Line cupcake tins with cupcake liners. Set aside.In a large bowl combine both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.In a medium bowl whisk together the milk, sour cream, and egg whites. Set aside. In a small food chopper, blend the zest and the sugar together until the zest is very fine. Set aside.Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, or use a hand mixer (I achieve a better dome with the hand mixer). Add the butter, sugar and vanilla to the bowl and beat at medium speed for 3 minutes, or until light. Scrape the sides as necessary.Add the vanilla extract and one third of the flour mixture while beating on medium speed, again scraping the sides as needed. Beat in half of the sour cream mixture. Alternately add the remaining flour mixture and sour cream until all the wet and dry ingredients have added, beating until the batter fully incorporated and smooth.Use a large scoop (about 3 tablespoons), evenly divide the batter between 18 lined muffin tins filling each about 2/3 of the way full.Bake for 15-24 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers come out clean. Cool on wire rack.For the Buttercream:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the butter. Beat until fluffy. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly add the confectioners' sugar while continuing to beat.Once well blended, add in the vanilla, lime juice, and 4 tablespoons of strawberry puree. Mix on low speed until well combined and moist. If desired, an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of strawberry puree until your desired consistency is reached. Beat at high speed until frosting is smooth and fluffy.Pipe or decorate as desired.

Bake directly on the center rack until tender when pierced with a knife, 45 minutes to 1 1/4 hours, depending on the size and type of your potatoes. Remove to a wire rack and let stand until cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes.Scoop the insides out of the potato skins and push through a potato ricer fitted with a fine disc onto a clean counter. (If you dont have a ricer, mash the potatoes until smooth.) Gather the potato into a mound on the counter, sprinkle with salt and let cool, about 15 minutes.Meanwhile, soak sun-dried tomatoes in boiling water until soft, 10 to 20 minutes. Place the egg yolk in a food processor. Drain the tomatoes; transfer to the food processor with the yolk; pulse until pureed.Put a large pot of water on to boil.Pour tomato puree over the cooled potato and then sprinkle 1 cup flour on top. Use a bench knife or metal spatula to gently fold the flour and tomato puree into the potatoes until combined (it will not look like dough at this point). Gently squeeze, knead and pat the dough until it holds together and resembles biscuit dough or cookie dough. The dough will be a little sticky; if its very sticky, add more flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary. Be careful not to overwork the dough: overworked dough will yield tougher gnocchi.Pat the dough into a 1 1/2-inch-thick disk and then divide it into 4 equal pieces. Working on a lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands, roll each portion into a 24- to 26-inch-long snake, 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide. Start at the center of the dough and roll out using your fingertips and very light pressure; gently pull the dough out as you roll. Cut the snake into 3/4-inch pieces. Use your fingertip to make an indentation (or dimple) in the center of each gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet as they are made. Repeat with remaining dough.Adjust the heat so the water is at a gentle boil. Add about one-quarter of the gnocchi at a time. When the gnocchi float to the top, transfer to a parchment or wax paper-lined baking sheet with a slotted spoon. Continue boiling the gnocchi in batches until they are all cooked, returning the water to a gentle boil between batches. Serve immediately or see Sauted Gnocchi (see Tip).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sun-dried-tomato-gnocchi-698003", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 135,
