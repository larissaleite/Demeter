Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot by several inches, but not enough to touch the tamales. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low; cover the pot with a kitchen towel and a lid and steam until firm, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, adding more water to the pot if needed. The tamales should pull away from the husks without sticking; if they're still sticky, continue cooking. Let stand at least 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen                                                    Recipe courtesy of Marcela Valladolid for Food Network Magazine

Remove dish from oven and transfer the tenderloin to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.To make the sauce: Meanwhile, in a skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat, add the shallots and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and saute 1 more minute. Add the red wine and as it boils, deglaze the pan by scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon (helps to have one with a straight edge) to dislodge all the browned bits. Once the wine is almost cooked away, add the beef stock and turn the heat to high. Boil the sauce down until there's a noticeable trail when you drag a wooden spoon through the center of it (4-5 minutes).Pour in the heavy cream and resume boiling. Again, boil down until you can make that telltale trail from the wooden spoon. Turn off the heat and add the parsley and any remaining black pepper (no more than 1 Tbsp, the rest should have already been used to pepper the tenderloin). Taste for salt and add if needed.Cut the tenderloin on a slight diagonal (in 1/2\" or 1\" slices), and then spoon the sauce over to serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pork-tenderloin-with-burgundy-peppercorn-sauce-527761", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste and Tell Blog", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grilled-White-Pizza-with-Bacon-and-Basil-606268.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 606268, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Grilled White Pizza with Bacon and Basil", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 131.73, "creditText": "Taste and Tell Blog", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 lb Jones Dairy Farm Dry Aged bacon", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": ["dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10123, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1034053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "handful of fresh basil leaves, torn", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh basil leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "handful", "unitShort": "handful", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "handful"}, {"originalString": "1 lb pizza dough", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "pizza dough", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pizza-dough.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93610, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup ricotta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "ricotta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1036, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded mozzarella cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-white.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1001026, "unit": "oz"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 21.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteandtellblog.com/grilled-white-pizza-recipe-with-bacon-and-basil/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 12, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Dice the bacon into 1/4-inch pieces.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg", "id": 10123, "name": "bacon"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the bacon.
