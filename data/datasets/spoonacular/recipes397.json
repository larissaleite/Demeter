Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the butternut squash puree, the 4 cups broth, thyme, half of the pears or nectarines, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.Using a blender, puree the soup in batches until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and stir in the half-and-half. Add more broth if needed to reach the desired consistency. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with the prosciutto/bacon, remaining pear slices, hazelnut cream, yogurt or seeds. Serve immediately.Toppings: Set out the various toppings and let your guests choose which they would prefer.  The pears and hazelnut cream make for a more sweet soup, while the bacon, cumin yogurt or roasted butternut squash seeds make for a more savory bite.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/butternut-squash-soup-509084", "dishTypes": ["soup"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Erica Sweet Tooth", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Dark-Chocolate-Dipped-Peppermint-Shortbread-624674.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 624674, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Dark Chocolate Dipped Peppermint Shortbread", "pricePerServing": 63.47, "creditText": "Erica Sweet Tooth", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup crushed candy canes (plus more for sprinkling on top)", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "candy canes", "metaInformation": ["crushed", "plus more for sprinkling on top)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/candy-canes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 93759, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "6 oz dark chocolate melts", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "chocolate wafer melts", "metaInformation": ["dark"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 93775, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1-1/2 tbsp cornstarch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cornstarch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20027, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Red nonpareils", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "nonpareils", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/colorful-sprinkles.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 24.0, "id": 93645, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/8 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tsp vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "Few drops peppermint flavoring oil", "aisle": "?", "name": "few drops peppermint flavoring oil", "metaInformation": [], "unitLong": "drops", "unitShort": "drops", "amount": 3.0, "unit": "drops"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.ericasweettooth.com/2014/12/dark-chocolate-dipped-peppermint-shortbread.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png", "id": 404628, "name": "hand mixer"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch and salt.
