this recipe, but you can also prepare metal mini muffin pans with paper liners. Also, I found that there are different sized mini muffin pans out there, so your yield and baking time may vary a bit. The silicone pans I used yield a little bigger mini cupcake than others, which I also happen to like.Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl and set aside. In a large bowl, beat butter until smooth. Add sugar and beat to blend. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then the lemon juice, lemon peel, and food coloring. Batter may look curdled, but that's just fine. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, in 3 additions. Place about 1 tablespoon of batter into bottom of each cupcake hole. Place 1 fresh raspberry on top of the batter, in the center. Cover raspberry with more batter, about 3/4 full. Bake cupcakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean. This took about 20 minutes for me, but it will depend on the size of your tins, so pay close attention to your baking time. Cool 10 minutes and remove from pan. Cool completely before adding frosting.Cook the raspberries in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently until the raspberries are broken down into a sauce. Set a fine mesh strainer lined with 2 layers of cheese cloth and set over a bowl. Pour the raspberry sauce over the cheese cloth to remove the seeds. Gather up the ends of the cheese cloth and press out all the raspberry juice with the back of a spatula. You should be able to get at least a half cup of juice from this amount of berries, but I can usually press out almost 3/4 of a cup. Pour the raspberry juice back in the pot. Simmer until the juice reduces to a 1/4 cup. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool completely.With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar, the 1/4 cup of cooled raspberry sauce, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add another 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If you want the frosting less stiff, add some milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. I did not add any milk to mine, and thought it was perfect for piping.Fit a pastry bag with a medium star tip (I used a Wilton #21) and pipe the frosting onto your baby cakes.",

flour, baking powder, and salt. Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat until light in color. Add the red food coloring, egg and milk and beat to combine. Proceed with recipe and chill for 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Sprinkle a work surface and rolling pin with confectioner's sugar and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move dough frequently to prevent it from sticking and add more confectioner's sugar to the work surface and rolling pin as needed. With a 2 1/2-by-3-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut 36 hearts, re-rolling dough as needed. Place at least 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and bake until cookies are set but not brown, about 7-8 minutes. Let cool on the pan slightly before transferring to a rack to cool completely.To make striped Valentine hearts, transfer half of the melted chocolate to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Starting at the bottom of the cookie, apply gentle pressure to the pastry bag and drizzle lines of chocolate back and forth over the cookie, moving up as the chocolate flows. Allow chocolate to set before eating or packaging.To make polka-dot Valentine hearts, color the remaining chocolate with pink food coloring to the desired shade of pink. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Hold the pastry bag perpendicular to the cookie and apply gentle pressure to pipe a dot of chocolate. Release the pressure on the bag until the flow stops, and continue over the surface of the cookie, piping different sized dots, if desired. Gently tap the cookie to settle the chocolate and allow to set before eating or packaging.Cook's Note: If gel paste food colorings are not available, add liquid food coloring until you achieve desired color. For pink, simply use a little red.

sage) in a large bowl and whisk together.Add the cold butter pieces into the dry ingredients and cut into the flour, using a pastry cutter or a fork, until it resembles coarse meal.Add the cold buttermilk into the bowl and stir with a spoon or a rubber spatula JUST until combined. This should only take a few turns. The dough will be pretty wet and sticky.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board. With floured hands gently pat out (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until it's about \" thick. Add a tiny bit of flour over top if needed and fold the dough over itself about 5 times, gently pressing down in between each fold. Gently pat the dough out to a 1 inch thick.Use a round cutter to cut into rounds about 2 inch wide.Gently pat the scraps together to cut out the rest of your biscuits. These biscuits will not be quite as tender.IF BAKING IMMEDIATELY: Place the biscuits in a cake pan or springform pan close together. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with black pepper. Bake in a preheated 450F oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Do not open the oven door for AT LEAST the first half of baking time. You want the steam to stay trapped in the oven to help with the rise. Brush biscuits with melted butter if desired.IF FREEZING THE BISCUITS TO BAKE LATER: Place the biscuits in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the baking sheet in the freezer until frozen solid, about 1 hour. Transfer the frozen biscuits into a zip top freezer bag, pushing out all of the air, and store in the freezer until ready to bake.TO BAKE FROM FROZEN: Remove the biscuits from the freezer and place in a single layer on a parchment lined baking sheet, giving some space in between for heat circulation (this is important when baking from frozen). Let biscuits sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes while preheating the oven to 475F. Brush the biscuits with melted butter and sprinkle with black pepper. Bake at 475F for 8 minutes without opening the door, then shut the oven off and leave the biscuits in the oven for another 8-10 minutes, until golden brown. The biscuits will only be halfway done baking after the first 8 minutes and will look really pale in color.

Spray a loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.Puree the tomatoes in a blender and measure out 2 cups for the cake.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, and then mix in the 2 cups tomato puree. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the tomato-butter mixture and mix to combine.Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool slightly, and then remove from the pan and transfer to a rack to cool completely.To make the tomato glaze, mix together the confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons of the reserved tomato juice until the mixture reaches a glaze-like consistency.

Line a standard muffin tin with paper liners. Place chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over (not in) a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally just until melted, 4 to 5 minutes.Remove bowl from heat. Whisk in sugar and salt until mixture is smooth; whisk in eggs to combine. Gently whisk in flour and cocoa just until smooth (do not over mix). Fill each cupcake to about  full with batter. Bake, rotating halfway through, until a toothpick inserted halfway in centers comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached, about 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for a10 minutes, then remove cupcakes and allow to cool completely on the rack. Cupcakes can be stored up to 3 days at room temperature in airtight containers.Using the whisk attachment on the mixer, beat butter until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, sift together powdered sugar and cocoa. Whisk together to combine. Whisk in sugar mixture with butter, alternating with milk, beating well after each addition. Beat until smooth. Blend in vanilla. Butttercream will be light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag.In a small bowl, whisk together  cup powdered sugar and milk; add milk a  teaspoon at a time until a glue like consistency is reached. Add more powdered sugar if needed to thicken the glaze. Place 2 tablespoons of the white glaze in a small plastic bag or bottle to use for writing on the tombstones and set aside.In the remaining glaze, add a small amount of black food coloring to color the tombstones gray. Cover with plastic wrap if not using immediately. Dip the halved cookie into the gray glaze, scraping off excess glaze. Allow glazed tombstones to fully dry on a sheet pan. For the white writing glaze, cut off a small portion of the tip of the plastic bottle (if using), and write the letters on each dried tombstone. Set aside.Pipe a generous amount of buttercream in the shape of a circle on top of each cupcake. Sprinkle about a teaspoon of crushed cookies evenly on top of the piped buttercream. Add the tombstone to the center of each cupcake.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Cut each apple quarter in thirds crosswise and combine in a bowl with the zests, juices, 1/2 cup sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.Roll out half the pie dough and drape it over a 9- or 10-inch pie pan to extend about 1/2-inch over the rim. Don't stretch the dough; if it's too small, just put it back on the board and re-roll it.Fill the pie with the apple mixture. Brush the edge of the bottom pie crust with the egg wash so the top crust will adhere. Top with the second crust and trim the edges to about 1-inch over the rim. Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp the 2 together with your fingers or a fork. Brush the entire top crust with the egg wash, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar, and cut 4 or 5 slits.Place the pie on a sheet pan and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the crust is browned and the juices begin to bubble out. Serve warm.                                                Perfect Pie Crust:                                        12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter3 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon kosher salt1 tablespoon sugar1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening6 to 8 tablespoons (about 1/2 cup) ice water                                                            Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board. Fold the dough in half, place in a pie pan, and unfold to fit the pan. Repeat with the top crust.

Once hot, add short ribs and sear on all sides, just for about 1 minute, until golden and brown. Remove and place in the crockpot. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and cumin and mix. Sprinkle over short ribs, then pour beer in to the crockpot. Cook for about 8 hours on low, or until meat is falling off the bone. If able to, rotate short ribs once or twice during cooking.Once finished cooking, remove with kitchen tongs and set on a large place. Let cool until you can touch them, then remove the meat from the bone. In a large bowl, combine cabbage, lime zest and juice with a pinch of salt, tossing well with your hands to coat.To serve, warm tortillas first, then assemble tacos with meat first, then cabbage, then crumbled cheese.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9x13-inch pan with parchment, then grease and flour the pan; set aside.2. Make the Cake: In a small bowl, melt the butter, then stir in the cocoa powder and hot water until the cocoa is completely dissolved; set aside.3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, espresso powder, sugar, baking soda and salt; set aside. Pour the cocoa mixture over the dry ingredients, stirring to blend completely. Add the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla, and stir with a rubber spatula until completely combined.4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake begins to pull away from the edges of the pan. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire cooling rack.5. Make the Filling: Place the cocoa powder, chocolate chips, salt and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the cream is very hot, and the chips have softened, about 1 minutes. Remove from the microwave and stir until the chips are melted and the mixture is smooth, microwaving again briefly if necessary. Stir in the vanilla and set aside.6. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, shortening and half of the powdered sugar on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chocolate mixture and continue beating until smooth. Scrap the sides of the bowl and add the remaining 2 cups powdered sugar. Beat again until the filling is fluffy.7. Assemble the Cakes: Turn the cooled cake out of the pan and cut it in half crosswise, to make two 9\"x6.5\" rectangles. using a long serrated knife, slice through the middle of each rectangle to make two halves (a top and a bottom).8. Spread half of the filling on one bottom piece to the edge of the cake. Repeat with the other bottom piece. Top the bottom pieces with the top pieces. You should now have two chocolate-filled 9\"x6.5\" cakes.9. Make the Icing: Combine the chocolate chips, corn syrup vanilla and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the cream is very hot, and the chips have softened, about 1 minute. Stir till the chips have melted and the mixture is smooth, microwaving again briefly if necessary. Add the powdered sugar and beat on medium speed until smooth.10. Spread the icing evenly over the two cakes. Working with one cake at a time, slice into nine 2x3-inch snack cakes. Repeat with the remaining cake for 18 total snack cakes.Store the cakes at room temperature in an airtight container (you can wrap them individually in plastic wrap to keep them extra-fresh) for up to

Gently fold the blackberries into the cupcake batter.Divide the batter evenly between cupcake liners, about 3 tablespoons for each cupcake.Bake at 350F for 14-16 minutes, baking times will vary by oven. Check the cupcakes for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cupcake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are done. Allow cupcakes to cool completely.For the frosting: Puree or smash the blackberries until they are just juice. Strain the blackberries through a fine sieve so that there are no seeds left in the juice. You may need to press the blackberries through the sieve to extract as much juice as you can. Set the juice aside.Cut butter into pieces. Using the paddle attachment, whip butter for 3-4 minutes, scraping down the bowl occasionally. Beat until butter looks light in color.Add 2 cups powdered sugar and mix on low speed until incorporated into butter. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix to combine.Continuing adding powdered sugar, one to two cups at a time, followed by 1 tablespoons of heavy cream and beat on low speed until the cream is incorporated.Slowly add the blackberry juice and continuing beating until its well incorporated. Increase the mixing speed to medium-high and beat for an additional 2 minutes.Pipe the frosting with a large star tip and top with a blackberry.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blackberry-cabernet-cupcakes-799475", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 24, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/molten-lava-cakes-368054.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 368054, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Molten Lava Cakes", "preparationMinutes": 35, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Pinch of cayenne pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2031, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting (optional)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "confectioners' sugar", "metaInformation": ["plus more for dusting "], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 19336, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "6 large eggs plus 6 egg yolks", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolks", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 teaspoons granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Pinch of nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2025, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "semisweet chocolate", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 19903, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 sticks unsalted butter, plus more for the ramekins", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "plus more for the ramekins"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "sticks", "unitShort": "sticks", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "sticks"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 46.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/molten-lava-cakes-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 34, "aggregateLikes": 1945, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Generously brush the bundt pan with shortening and dust with flour.Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl and set aside. In another bowl, whisk the sour cream, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla and set aside.Whisk the eggs and sugar together in another bowl, stirring vigorously to lighten the eggs. Gradually whisk in the oil until evenly combined. Add the sour cream mixture and stir together. Add the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon just until combined but still a bit lumpy. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.Bake the cake until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool 10 minutes; then unmold cake  onto a rack placed over a baking sheet. Cool. (The cake can be prepared to this point a day ahead.)When ready to serve. Combine the rhubarb, jam, water and salt in a small saucepan and simmer until the rhubarb gets translucent and syrupy, almost jewel like,, about 10 minutes. Add a bit more water, if the glaze gets too thick . Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla. Let cool slightly. Spoon some of the glaze over the top of the cake, and reserve the rest for serving with sliced cake. Serve.Cook's Note: We like to bake this cake the day before we serve it so the flavors and texture ripen. If you bake it a day ahead, glaze the day you plan to serve it.Copyright 2007 Television Food Network, G.P.

                                   Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Combine black pepper, allspice, oregano, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a small bowl. Season chicken liberally on all sides, using about half of the spice mixture and reserving the rest for later.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Heat oil over medium-high heat in an oven-safe Dutch oven until shimmering. Place chicken in pan, skin-side down. Cook without moving until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Turn with spatulas and brown second side, about 4 minutes longer. Remove chicken from pan transfer to large plate. Add carrots and onions to the pan, scraping the bottom to dislodge browned bits. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly softened, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 2 minutes longer.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Add wine and scrape bottom of pan to dislodge any more browned bits. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and add cider vinegar, chicken broth and four jalapenos. Stir in remaining spice mixture. Return chicken to the pan, nestling thighs skin-side up in vegetables. Transfer to oven and cook uncovered until chicken is cooked through and liquid is mostly reduced, about 25 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While chicken is cooking, cover potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water. Season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until fork tender, about 15 minutes after boil has been reached. Drain potatoes and return to pan. Add remaining two jalapenos, butter, sour cream, whole milk, and cream cheese. Mash with a potato masher or whip with a handheld mixer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            5
