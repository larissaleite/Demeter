When cool enough to handle, remove chicken from bones and cut into 1/2-inch pieces; discard bones.                                                                                           In a large stockpot coated with cooking spray, saute onion in oil until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Add the celery, beans, carrots, parsley and Italian seasoning. Stir in broth and chicken base. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender.                                                                                           Stir in noodles and corn. Return to a boil; cook, uncovered, for  3 minutes. Add okra; cook 4-6 minutes longer or until noodles and okra are tender. Stir in chicken; heat through.                                        Yield: 10 servings (3-3/4 quarts).
