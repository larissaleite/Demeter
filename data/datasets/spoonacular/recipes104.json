Slice the tip off the head, exposing the cloves. Place the garlic on a piece of foil, drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil and wrap into a package.Place a wire rack on a large foil-lined baking sheet. Place the garlic packet, tomatoes, bell peppers, poblanos and jalapeo on the rack. Roast in the center of the oven, turning once or twice with tongs, until all the vegetables are softened and the peppers and onions are blackened in places, 25 to 30 minutes for the tomatoes, 30 to 35 minutes for the peppers and 40 minutes for the garlic.Transfer the peppers to a large bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let steam for 10 minutes, then uncover. Cool tomatoes on a separate plate; unwrap the garlic packet.When the peppers are cool enough to handle, remove stems, skins and seeds with a paring knife. Core and peel the tomatoes and reserve any juices. Squeeze the roasted garlic from the skins. Place the peppers, tomatoes (and juice) and garlic in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is a chunky sauce.Heat the remaining 3 teaspoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Add seafood stock, vinegar and the pureed vegetables. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and hot sauce. Stir in mint, parsley and scallions.To prepare fish: Meanwhile, combine cornmeal, flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on a shallow plate.

Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Drain or spoon off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the pot. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables just begin to become tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add the flour, thyme, paprika, and bay leaves. Stir the flour into the vegetables to make a paste and coat them evenly. Cook a minute or two to get rid of the raw flour smell. Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until all of the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.Uncover the pot and add the potato, half-and-half, and corn. Simmer, uncovered, until the potato is very tender but not yet falling apart, 10 to 12 minutes. If desired, puree about a cup of the soup in a food processor or blender and stir it back into the soup. Discard the bay leaves. Serve garnished with the cooked bacon and some chives or parsley.                                                    Recipe from \"Farmhouse Rules\" by Nancy Fuller.

Bring to a simmer. Peel and slice potatoes, and add them to the simmering water. Add a few pinches of salt, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Check the potatoes with a knife. If the knife has some resistance, continue simmering the potatoes until the knife comfortably slides through the potatoes. When the potatoes have cooked through about 15 minutes, drain them in a large colander. Add them back to the saucepan. To the saucepan, add the milk and butter, followed by a the nutmeg. Mash potatoes until smooth. Stir in Dijon mustard. Season with more salt and pepper, to taste.

Cut a buttercup squash in half and scoop out the seeds & insides. Place the squash cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle just a tiny bit of water inside the foil (fold the edges of the foil up a bit so it wont leak). Poke a few holes in the top of the squash and roast until its soft and a fork easily slides in and out. About 45 minutes. Let squash cool then scoop the flesh out from the skin and discard the skin.Mash together 1 cup of the soft squash with the butter, maple syrup, cinnamon and salt. Stir until smooth. (Taste and add more maple and/or spices to your liking - it should taste pumpkin pie-like). Store puree in the fridge until ready to use.For the bars:: Line an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish with parchment paper. In a food processor pulse together the flour, walnuts, brown sugar, butter and salt until it becomes crumbly. (Similar to the texture of wet sand). If the crumble is too dry, add a few drops of water and pulse again.Scoop  cup of the crumble mixture and set it aside to use later for the topping.Press the rest of the crumble firmly and evenly into the baking dish. Bake the crust for about 20 minutes or until its lightly golden brown around the edges and dry to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. (note: the crust can be made and baked a day in advance)Spread the squash puree evenly over the pre-baked crust. Top with chocolate chips, shredded coconut and the remainder of the crumble mixture. (Optional: bake a few minutes more to toast the topping and melt the chocolate).Chill bars in the fridge for at least a few hours to set before slicing. To slice, use a knife to gently loosen the edges, then (very) carefully lift the parchment paper out of the pan. Use a sharp knife to slice bars into 1x2 inch rectangles.

For the herb salt: Combine the salt, oregano and thyme in a small bowl and mix to blend.For the grilled zucchini: Brush the zucchini planks on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle on both sides with some of the herb salt. Transfer the zucchini to a grill pan set over medium heat and cook until tender, about 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove the zucchini to a serving plate and sprinkle with the feta.                                                            Save any leftover herb salt.
