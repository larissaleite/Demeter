In a large bowl, whisk together the turmeric, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons oil. Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you're using the homemade kind. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate.Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Now here's the important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water.Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes.Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off.Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve.*Cook's Note: Paneer is very easy to make at home, and my recipe is quick, easy, and delicious. I also think homemade has a better texture than anything store-bought.

Then cut off small pieces of the broccoli florets and set aside the veggies.For the Noodles:  Boil water in a medium size sauce pan and add the bean thread noodles.  Stir them up a bit and cook for about 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft, slippery, and translucent.  When the noodles are done, rinse them in cold water.  Set aside.For the Chicken:  Heat a skillet on medium heat and add the olive oil.  Then add the chicken.  Add the garlic powder, pepper, and onion powder and stir the chicken.  Continue stirring the chicken and cook until the chicken starts to brown.  Set aside.For the Spring Rolls:  Fill a large shallow bowl with hot water (hot tap water should be fine).  Put the edges of the spring roll wrapper in the hot water.  Then, put the entire spring roll wrapper in the hot water for about 20 seconds or until it starts to get soft.  Lay the spring roll wrapper on to a plate.  Set out all of the other ingredients by the spring roll wrapper.  Lay a piece of the lettuce on the spring roll wrapper just under the middle of the wrapper.Then top the lettuce with small portions of the bean thread noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro, zucchini, broccoli, and green onion.  Roll the wrapper once, just over the veggies.  Then fold over one side of the wrapper in about 1 inch.Then fold over the other side of the wrapper in about 1 inch.  Next, add a couple pieces of the carrots and chicken (browned side down).  This will be a \u201cwindow\u201d that will show off the pretty colors.  Gently roll the wrapper tightly over the chicken and carrots.Continue rolling the wrapper to form the spring roll.  The spring roll can be served whole or cut diagonally.
