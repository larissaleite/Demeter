For more of our featured posts, visit Oprah.com today.)Gluten-Free Gingerbread, adapted from November 2009 issue of GourmetRain is hitting the windows on the door behind me so hard it sounds like little pellet guns full of pebbles are being fired at me. For days the wind has blown and blown, taking all the lovely yellow leaves with it. A few weeks ago, the heater was dusty in a corner of the room. Now, it's on nearly every evening.Time for gingerbread.We've been cooking out of the November issue of Gourmet all week, instead of a cookbook. Tonight, I intended to tell you all about that experience, and why I love the magazine so much. But I find myself, at the end of the evening, still bereft of words. We're leaving for a little trip in the morning, and I don't want to rush this. So tonight, I'll simply share this instead.One of the dessert recipes in the November issue was a pumpkin gingerbread trifle. I don't know about you, but trifles feel like summer to me. That and they have so many cups of custard (or in this case, pumpkin mousse) that eating the trifle would have kept me chained to the couch, in full nap form. So I passed it by when first deciding what to cook this week. Then, the rain started.Gingerbread, with its densely layered spices and dark molasses promise, seemed just the thing. Since I know that Gourmet recipes work, I felt comfortable converting it to a gluten-free version. I sifted and sniffed the spices, waited for the butter to soften on the counter, dug out the molasses, and started mixing. An hour later, we were holding gingerbread in our hands.I swear, Danny ate half the pan before bed last night. I mean, I helped too, but he really loved this stuff. \"This is good, honey.\" I just smiled. I love making him happy with baked goods.This morning, in dim light, I tried to take a photograph of the gingerbread. Puffed high, light, but still spongy-soft like crackers soaked in milk, this gingerbread is the best I've ever made. But on a saucer, on a countertop, it looked like a square of dark on white. The dark skies outside didn't help. Ready to give up, I brought it into our bedroom, on a table I like to shoot on sometimes. Before I could figure out the aperture, Little Bean grabbed a piece and started eating. I chased her around the room, laughing. Then stopped to look down and took this shot.Good enough for Little Bean? We think it will be good enough for you too.1/2 cup quinoa flour3/4 cup teff flour1/4 cup oat flour (please make sure this is made from certified gluten-free oats)3/4 cup sweet rice flour1/2 cup tapioca flour2 teaspoons xanthan gum3/4 teaspoon guar gum1 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon baking powder2 teaspoons ground ginger1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon ground cloves1 teaspoon ground black pepper1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar1/2 cup granulated sugar2 large eggs1/2 cup molasses3/4 cup buttermilk (shake it up)1/2 cup hot waterPreparing to bake. Preheat the oven to 350. Butter a 13 by 9-inch pan. Lay down tin foil, with some overlapping on both sides of the pan. Butter the foil.Combining the dry ingredients. Sift the quinoa flour, teff flour, oat flour, sweet rice flour, and tapioca flour into a large bowl. Add the xanthan and guar gums, the baking soda and powder, and the spices. Whisk together. Set aside.Creaming the butter and sugars. Put the butter and sugars into the bowl of a stand mixer and run at medium speed until they are fluffy together, about 5 minutes. Plop in the eggs, one at a time, and run the mixer until the eggs are incorporated. Add the molasses and buttermilk. At this point, the dough will look speckled and perhaps even curdled. Don't worry. This is what is supposed to happen.Finishing the batter. Add the flour mixture into the wet ingredients about 1/2 cup at a time, slowing down to make sure it is incorporated before you add more. When you have finished with the flours, add the very hot water and mix for 1 minute more. It should all look lovely and toothsome now.Baking the gingerbread. Spread the batter into the pan and even out the top with a rubber spatula. (Don't worry if you have strange crevices and places that stick up like Alfalfa hair. That's part of the charm.) Slide it in the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool the gingerbread to just-warm in the pan. Remove the gingerbread on the foil, then slide it onto a cutting board. Cut into the desired-size slices.Feeds about 10.

Sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar and let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.                                                                Turn the mixer on low speed and add the remaining 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup of the sugar, the 1 cup melted butter, the egg yolks, and salt. Add 2 cups of the flour and turn the speed up to medium; continue to mix until incorporated. Gradually add the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and continue to mix until the dough holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl; the dough will be very soft.                                                                 Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Put the dough in a large bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen.                                                                Combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl. Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with melted butter.                                                                On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about the size of the loaf pan. Brush the surface of the dough with melted butter and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly across. Roll the dough up, jelly-roll style, into a long cylinder, and pinch the seam closed. Put the dough in the prepared loaf pan, seam side down. Make sure the dough touches all sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise a second time, until the top of the dough is nearly level with the top of the loaf pan, about 20 minutes.                                                                 Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush the dough with more melted butter.                                                                 Bake until your kitchen smells like cinnamon and the bread is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and marinara sauce. Stir to combine, then add oregano, thyme, sugar, salt, bay leaves, and crushed red pepper (if using). Stir, then add cooked ground beef and stir to combine. Place the lid on the pot and allow to simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add a little water or some low-sodium broth if it needs more liquidAfter an hour, add the minced parsley and the rind from a wedge of Parmesan (or grated Parmesan if you prefer--or both!) Stir to combine, then put the lid back on and allow it to simmer for another 30 minutes or so. Discard bay leaves before serving.Serve a big bowl of oiled noodles and spaghetti sauce so guests can serve themselves.

Place in the cold oven, then turn the oven on to 400F, and set the timer for 20 minutes. Soak the oysters in the buttermilk for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.In the meantime, melt the butter in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat. Whisk the eggs with the arugula, Tabasco, and half-and-half. Season with salt and pepper and then pour the mixture into the pan.Grab a wooden spoon and start stirring. You will be tempted to turn the heat up, but don\u2019t. If you keep stirring the eggs at a medium-low temperature they will produce the creamiest, most delicious eggs you\u2019ve ever had. It should take 8 to 10 minutes to set into small curds, but they will still have lots of moisture. Look for creamy, barely set eggs.When the eggs are done, place them at the back of the stove to keep warm.When the bacon has finished cooking, remove it from the oven and set aside to drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Drain the oysters and discard the buttermilk. Place the panko on a plate and dredge the oysters, coating them well on both sides.In a fresh saut\u00e9 pan over high heat, add the vegetable oil.

If your shrimp are very large, you may need to cut them in half once again (far right). Remove the dark vein if present, then add the shrimp to a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of egg white, 1 teaspoon of potato starch, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the halved shrimp, then use your fingers to vigorously \"whisk\" the shrimp together with the egg until the shrimp are evenly coated with a white froth. If you're using a food processor, roughly chop the pork fat, and add it to the food processor. Process until finely minced. Add the small peeled shrimp and calamari, and pulse until there are no big chunks, but not to the point where it turns into a paste. If you are doing it by hand, finely mince the fat, small shrimp and calamari separately and add to a large bowl. Add the scallions, potato starch, egg white, ginger juice, Shaoxing wine, sugar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, and white pepper. Pulse the food processor until combined, or use your hand to \"whisk\" the mixture together thoroughly. Prepare a large steamer and line the bottom with napa cabbage or lettuce (this prevents the dumplings from sticking to the steamer). Bring the water to a boil. To wrap the shumai, form an \"o\" with your left hand (assuming you're right handed). Cover the \"o\" with a wrapper, then put a generous teaspoon of filling in the middle. Add a half shrimp on top, pressing the dumping into the \"o\".Add another teaspoon of filling, then use the thumb of your opposite hand to press the dumping all the way into the \"o\" shape in your hand, using your thumb to level off the top. Top with one more half of shrimp. Make sure the colored side of the shrimp faces up so it turns red when cooked. Make sure the top and bottom of the dumpling are flat, then repeat until you have enough dumplings to fill the steamer. Turn off the heat, then place the dumplings in the hot steamer, leaving enough space between the dumplings so they are not touching each other. Cover the steamer with a damp kitchen towel, then cover with the lid. Flip the corners of the towel back over the lid to keep them from catching on fire. The towel keeps the condensation from dripping on the dumplings.Turn the heat back on and steam the shumai over high-heat for 8 minutes.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.Beat the egg whites and salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form. While beating, add the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Beat in the peppermint.Fold the top of a pastry bag fitted with a round tip over and down a few inches. Dip a paintbrush in the food coloring. Starting inside the pastry tip, brush a stroke of food coloring from the tip to the top of the bag. Repeat with 3 more evenly spaced strokes. Fill the bag with the meringue; try to spoon it directly into the center so as not to smudge the food coloring (though some smudging is inevitable). Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds of meringue spaced 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheets.Bake until the meringues are no longer glossy and feel light and dry when picked up, about 1 hour. Open the oven for a few minutes, then turn it off and shut the door. Leave the meringues in the oven until they are completely dry inside, about 2 hours. The meringues can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Cook's Note: Though you can also use regular water-based food coloring, we prefer gel for this recipe because it paints onto the pastry bag better and the final color is more vibrant.

Grease and line 3 8-inch baking pans with parchment paper.In a medium bowl combine the chocolate and cocoa. Pour the boiling water over and whisk until combined and smooth. Set aside.In another bowl, sift together the flours, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter on medium high speed until creamy. Add the brown sugar and beat on for an additional 3 minutes, until light and fluffy.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and beat the eggs in one at a time, beating for 30 seconds in between each addition.Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat on medium until just combined.With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture and the chocolate mixture, alternating between both and starting and ending with the flour mixture. Beat until just combined, but be careful not to overmix.Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans (I used a kitchen scale for this). Place 1 pan on the upper-middle rack and 2 pans on the lower middle rack and bake for 18-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Cool the pans on wire racks for about 15 minutes. Use a knife to run around the edge of each pan, invert the cakes onto the wire racks, and cool completely before frosting.With an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until light and creamy (about 2-3 minutes).Add the powdered sugar, mix on low until combined, then beat on medium for an additional 2-3 minutes.Add in the vanilla and beat to combine.Gradually add in the melted chocolate and beat on low until smooth. Add in the milk one tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency.Place one layer of the cake on an 8-inch cake board. Place 1 cup of the frosting on top, and spread evenly with a palette knife. Place the second layer on top of the first, followed by another cup of frosting, and spread evenly.Place the third layer on top and put a generous scoop of frosting on the top of the cake. Spread evenly across the top of the cake. Work your way around the sides until the entire cake is covered with a thin layer of frosting. I find that a turntable is helpful when frosting a layer cake. Let the crumb coat set in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Once the crumb coat has set, spread a thicker layer of frosting on the top and sides of the crumb coat to create a smooth finish. Use the leftover frosting to pipe onto the cake and top with sprinkles.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until garlic is fragrant. Remove skillet from heat and stir in cooked bacon. Discard paper towel from plate and remove skillet mixture to the same plate. Set aside.Set same skillet over medium heat once again (no need to clean it first). Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. While whisking constantly, sprinkle the flour over the melted butter to form a paste. Gradually whisk in cream, and then milk. Cook until mixture comes to a boil, whisking almost constantly. Then add Parmesan and soy sauce, and cook for 1 minute longer while whisking constantly. Add more freshly ground black pepper, if desired. Remove from heat.Place one tablespoon of cream sauce into the bottom of each jar. Layer in 3 of the larger rounds of potato into each jar, followed by another tablespoon of cream sauce. Add 1/3 cup of bacon and mushroom mixture to each jar, and press in flat with the back side of a spoon. Divide 4 ounces of the shredded cheese amongst each jar, and then add 3 more rounds of potato to each jar. Spoon two tablespoons of cream sauce over potato rounds in each jar. Top each jar with 1 tablespoon of the bacon and mushroom mixture, and then sprinkle the remaining 2 ounces of cheese over the top of each jar. Finish with some freshly ground black pepper.To bake immediately:Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. With the jars on the pan, Loosely tent the jars with one large piece of foil, so the cheese doesn't burn. Don't press the foil down onto the jars. Place pan of jars in oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and then bake for another 10 minutes, or until cream sauce is bubbling and cheese is browned a bit. Remove from oven and serve hot.To bake later the same day or the following day:Place gratins in a covered storage container and refrigerate until ready to bake. Take gratins out of refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Set jars on a pan and loosely tent the jars with one large piece of foil, so the cheese doesn't burn. Don't press the foil down onto the jars. Place pan of jars in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and then bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until cream sauce is bubbling and cheese is browned a bit.

Mix on medium-low until incorporated.In a separate bowl, mix together the flour blend, palm sugar, xanthan gum, and yeast.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix on the lowest speed until the ingredients are incorporated and there are no specks of dry flour left, scraping down the bowl as needed. Turn the mixer to high and beat for 2 minutes.  Add the salt and beat for a minute more.Remove the whisk attachment.  Leave the dough in the mixing bowl. Use a rubber spatula to round the top of the dough.  Cover with plastic and let it rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours.Prepare a 9 x 5 loaf pan with cooking spray. After the first 1 1/2 hours of rising time, put the bowl back on the stand mixer and beat with the whisk attachment for another three minutes.  The dough will deflate and look like it did to begin with. That\u2019s ok.  Transfer the dough to the prepared pan, smooth the top, and place in a plastic box to and let it rise for an hour to an hour and a half, until it\u2019s level with the top of the pan.   (Note:  I shape the dough so that the center is slightly higher than the ends, which produces that nice, rounded shape in the final loaf.)Place the bottom part of a broiler pan on the bottom rack of your oven.  Thirty minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (see notes in post about oven temperature).  Just before the loaf is ready to bake, dust it with Amy\u2019s Basic Flour Blend then score it by cutting 3 diagonal slashes across the top, each  about 1/4 inch deep.  Put the bread into the oven.  Add a handful of ice cubes or a cup of cold water to the broiler tray then shut the oven door.  Bake for 50 \u2013 60 minutes, rotating the loaf 180 degrees after the first 30 minutes, until the loaf is golden brown on top and the internal temperature reaches 206\u00b0F.Let cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn the loaf on its side and scoot it out of the pan slightly so the steam can come out. After about 10 \u2013 15 minutes, you should be able to remove the loaf from the pan and either rest it on its side or stand it upright to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.

Prepare the Walnut Filling: Place the ground walnuts in a large bowl and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water and butter over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and it comes to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the hot syrup over the ground nuts, leaving about \u00bd cup of the syrup back. Stir together and if still a little dry, add more liquid a bit at a time. You want a moist, spreadable consistency, but you do not want it to be soupy. Set aside. 2. Prepare the Pineapple Filling: In a small saucepan, combine the crushed pineapple (including the liquid), sugar and cornstarch over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. 3. Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two half-sheet pans (13x18-inches) with parchment paper; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder; set aside.4. Using an electric mixer, beat together the shortening and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix until completely combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour in three additions, alternating with two additions of the warm milk, mixing until completely combined. 5. Divide the dough between the two baking sheets and use an offset spatula to spread the dough into an even layer on each sheet (the dough will be thick, like cookie dough, and will spread very thin). Bake until the cake springs back when the top is lightly pressed, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and place on wire racks to cool completely.6. Assemble the Cake: In a 9x13-inch pan, layer the sponge cake, cutting it as necessary to make a layer fit. Top with the walnut filling, spreading it into an even layer. Top with another layer of cake, again cutting and fitting pieces if need be. Top with the pineapple filling, spreading it into an even layer. Top with the final layer of cake, reserving a small strip of cake. Spread the entire jar of prune butter over the top and crumble the reserved strip of cake over the top. (My grandma mentioned that if you can't spare a strip of cake to crumble on the top, you can also use crushed up Nilla wafers.)7. The assembled cake should be stored in the refrigerator and set out at room temperature about 30 minutes before serving. It will keep in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap and foil for 1 week. This cake also freezes very well, wrapped tightly with plastic wrap and foil for up to 1 month.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/decker-cake-507344", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic":

Puree until thick, smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as necessary. Set aside while you make the crust. Note: you want to be able to pour the cheesecake onto the crust as SOON as it's out of the oven, which is why it's best to prepare it first.In a large bowl, beat together the coconut oil and maple syrup for the crust, until smooth. Stir in the coconut flour, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt until well mixed.Divide the dough by lightly heaping teaspoons between a 12-cavity mini-cheesecake pan, pressing out evenly.Bake until the the crust just appear set, about 5 minutesWhen the crust has about 2 minutes left to bake, transfer the cashew mixture into a large bowl and pour in the flax eggs from the refrigerator. You want to leave them into the refrigerator as long as possible, so they can really gel up. Stir until the flax is evenly mixed into the cashew cream.Remove the crusts from the oven. Your crust with most likely have risen in a few spots. Just use a small spoon to pack it back down flat, making sure you don't leave any cracks.Immediately fill each cavity, just over 3/4 of the way full, with the pumpkin cashew mixture.Bake until the cheesecakes have slightly risen and the outside appears set and firm, but just a small circle in the center still appears slightly jiggly, about 11-12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on the counter. Then, cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours to overnight to completely set.Once set, place the chocolate and coconut oil and in small, microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave using 30 second intervals on half power, stirring between each interval, until smooth and melted.Drizzle the chocolate over each cheesecake to create a Jack-O-Lantern face (I put my melted chocolate in a small

processor to make a paste. Pierce the roast all over with a paring knife; rub the spice paste into the meat. Tie the roast with kitchen twine so it keeps its shape.Spread the carrots in a 6-quart slow cooker and set the roast on top. Insert an instant-read thermometer at an angle into the center of the roast; position the thermometer so it can be easily read through the lid of the slow cooker.Combine 1 1/2 cups water, the Worcestershire sauce and bouillon cube in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until hot, 2 to 4 minutes. Add to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until the meat registers 120 to 130 degrees F for medium rare, about 2 hours. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and cover with foil; let rest 15 minutes. Skim off the excess fat from the cooking liquid.Remove the twine and slice the meat very thinly. Spoon some cooking liquid onto the cut sides of each roll; sandwich with the meat, horseradish and/or mustard. Serve with more cooking liquid for dipping.Photograph by Christopher Testani                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

30, "aggregateLikes": 354, "instructions": "For the Marinara:Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add onions and saute for 3-4 minutes (until beginning to soften). Add the garlic and saute for an additional minute, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Next, add the wine to the hot pan and allow it to deglaze the onions and garlic from the bottom of the pan. Allow the wine to reduce a little bit (1-2 minutes).Add the crush tomatoes and the liquid of the whole tomatoes. Take the whole tomatoes and either chop them into bite sized pieces, OR crush/tear them with your (clean) hands as you put them into the pan. Add the salt, sugar, and a little cracked black pepper and stir until combined. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 30 minutes. Just before making the subs, add the chopped basil and parsley.For the Chicken:Sprinkle each of the chicken cutlets with a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides. Set up assembly line of 3 shallow dishes (think: pie plates). In the first, place the flour. In the second, whisk the egg and milk together. In the third dish, mix the Panko bread crumbs and Italian bread crumbs. Dredge the chicken in the flour, then the egg wash, then the bread crumb mixture and place on a plate. Repeat until all cutlets are breaded.Preheat oven to 250 F. In a large non-stick skillet heat up a mix of the olive oil & butter over medium to medium-high heat - enough to cover the bottom of the pan (I usually do 2 parts olive oil to 1 part butter - you could certainly just use one or the other if desired). When pan is good and pre-heated add the breaded chicken cutlets in batches, being sure not to over crowd the pan. Cook until browned on both sides, adding oil and butter as pan dries up. It should take about 4-6 minutes per side (until cooked through - minimum of 165F). Place in preheated oven on a sheet pan while cooking remaining chicken cutlets.For the Chicken Parmesan Hoagies:When all cutlets are cooked, slice into 1/2 inch strips. Cut each of the hoagie rolls lengthwise in half, leaving the edge attached so it opens up like a book. Spoon a little marinara, pile on some of the chicken, spoon on some additional marinara, and add 4 slices of the provolone to each hoagie. Place on the sheet pan and turn oven up to BROIL. Place under the broiler until cheese is melted and edge of roll begins to brown. NOTE: Keep a CLOSE eye as this only takes a couple minutes & will burn if you aren't careful! Sprinkle with some crushed red pepper flakes if desired, slice hoagies in half and serve hot!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chicken-parmesan-hoagies-498211", "vegetarian": false,
