For irregularly sized cuts like cod, you may need to slice some fillets in half lengthwise to make them thinner. Alternatively, you can slice the fish into smaller bite-sized fish sticks, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide (the smaller pieces will be a bit easier to manage in the frying pan).In a mixing bowl, whisk together the seltzer, flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne to make a batter. The batter will bubble at first, then settle. Stir together the panko breadcrumbs and sesame seeds, then pour them onto a plate. Have an empty plate handy for the breaded fish.  Dip each piece of fish into the batter. When you pull the fish out of the batter, let the excess batter run back into the bowl.After dipping in the batter, gently roll each piece in panko crumbs to coat. Leaving too much batter on the fish will lead to clumping and will make the coating fall off the fish when frying, so make sure your fish is only lightly coated with batter before breading. Place the breaded fish onto the empty plate. Heat \u00bd inch of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium till hot but not smoking. Fry the breaded fish pieces in batches of 3 (if using smaller sized fish sticks, you can fry up to 6 at a time). If the oil is at the correct temperature, it should bubble and sizzle evenly\u2014no splatters or popping. Flip the fish when they turn dark golden brown. Don't flip them till they're completely golden-- the more you flip them, the more fragile the coating will become, so try to only flip each fillet once. If your oil is at the right temperature, it should take about 4-5 minutes per side for the fish to become golden and crisp.Place fried fish pieces on a wire rack to drain, if you have one. This will keep the fish as crisp as possible. Use paper towels to catch the oil drips underneath the rack. If you don\u2019t have a wire rack, you can drain the fish pieces on a double layer of paper towels.Once fish has drained, you make the sauce immediately and serve, or place the wire rack (without paper towels) on a baking sheet in the oven at 200 degrees F for up to 30 minutes till ready to serve. This will keep the fish warm, fresh and crisp.Just before serving, whisk together cornstarch and 2 tbsp water in the bottom of a small saucepan till dissolved.

Set aside.In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and powdered sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy.Add in the egg and vanilla, and beat to combine. Reduce the speed and gradually add the flour mixture, beating until the dough is just combined.Gather the dough and wrap it in plastic wrap, place in the refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer or overnight.Once the dough is chilled and ready, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Roll the dough on a sheet of parchment paper sprinkled with flour. Roll to 1/4 inch thickness. Place the parchment paper on a cookie sheet and freeze the entire thing for 15 minutes.Get another baking sheet and line that with parchment paper.Remove the dough from the freezer and begin to use your cookie cutter to cut the shapes. Place the cookies on the second baking sheet, about 1 inch apart from each other and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.After freezing again, bake the cookies for 8 minutes or until they feel crisp to the touch.Repeat the above steps until all the cookie dough has been used.Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before icing them.Combine the powdered sugar, meringue powder, and water in a mixing bowl and mix on low speed until the icing has a matte appearance, about 7-10 minutes.Slowly add in the copper or brown food coloring to get your desired color.Transfer some of the icing to a squeeze bottle and cover the remaining icing in the bowl with a damp washcloth. This is to prevent the icing from hardening.Begin to outline the edges of the mooses antlers. It is best to have your arm and hand resting comfortably on a table. Continue until all of the antlers are outlined.Clean the squeeze bottle as you will need it again.Now we want to use the icing to flood and color in the antlers. In order to do that, you will need to add more water to the icing so the consistency is thinner. Add 1/2 tsp of water at a time, stirring by hand, until the icing runs off the back of a spoon.Transfer some of the icing to the squeeze bottle. Begin to flood the inside of the antlers with icing, using a tooth pick to help spread the icing to the edges. You dont want to add too much icing, as this could cause the icing to overflow beyond the edges. Practice until you know how much icing you need.
