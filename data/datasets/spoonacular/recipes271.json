Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter is a light, nutty brown, about 30 seconds. Pour into a small bowl and let cool. Stir in oil. Slowly stir the butter-oil mixture into the flour with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Gradually stir in enough ice water so that the dough will hold together in a ball. Press the dough into a flattened disk.Place the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap and roll into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Remove the top sheet and invert the dough over a 9-inch pie plate. Remove the remaining wrap. Fold the edges under at the rim and crimp. Line the shell with a piece of foil or parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes, remove the weights or beans, and continue to bake until the crust is golden, 8 to 10 more minutes. Cool the pie shell on a rack while you make the filling. Reduce the oven temperature to 350.To make filling: Whisk together 1 1/4 cups sugar, cornstarch and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium heavy saucepan. Gradually whisk in boiling water. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat.Whisk together lemon juice, zest, egg and 1 egg white in a small bowl. Whisk a small amount of the hot sauce into the egg mixture, then whisk this mixture back into the sauce. Return to a simmer over medium heat, stirring, then cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in the butter until melted and pour into the baked pie shell. Set aside while you prepare meringue.To make meringue: Beat 3 egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and pinch of salt and beat at high speed until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar, beating constantly, until the mixture holds stiff, shiny peaks. Beat in the vanilla. Spread the meringue over the hot filling, sealing to edge of crust. Make attractive peaks with a metal spatula, knife or the back of a spoon. Bake until the top is lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack until it is room temperature, about 2 hours.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/light-lemon-meringue-pie-697377", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true,

Simmer about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand 20 minutes. (This standing time will infuse the cream with vanilla flavor; skip it if not using vanilla bean.) Remove and discard vanilla bean.                                                          2                               In medium bowl, beat 1/3 cup granulated sugar and egg yolks with wire whisk 3 minutes or until yolks lighten to lemon yellow. Ladle about 1 cup warm cream mixture into egg yolks and beat with wire whisk to combine. Repeat with another cup of cream mixture. Add yolk mixture to remaining cream mixture in saucepan.                                                          3                               Stir constantly with rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom of pan. Heat over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture thickens slightly and coats back of metal spoon. (Do not boil or overheat mixture because eggs will curdle.) Pour into medium bowl, using a strainer if there are any lumps. (If using 1 teaspoon vanilla instead of vanilla bean, add it now.) Cover with plastic wrap, pushing wrap onto custard surface to prevent film from forming. Cool at room temperature 15 minutes. Refrigerate at least 8 hours but no more than 24 hours. Place ice-cream maker bowl in freezer.                                                          4                               (If using frozen peaches, skip step 4.) In 4-quart Dutch oven, heat 2 quarts water to boiling. Add fresh peaches and allow them to bob in water 30 seconds. Use slotted spoon or strainer to remove peaches and immediately plunge into bowl of ice water to cool. Remove skins from peaches. Cut peaches in half and twist to separate halves. Remove and discard pits. Cut each peach half into 4 pieces.                                                          5                               In bowl of food processor, pulse peaches, lemon juice and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar until peaches are roughly chopped but not pureed (you are aiming for a chunky peach sauce). Stir in vodka if using. You should have about 2 cups chopped peaches. Refrigerated chopped peaches until cold, at least 1 hour.                                                          6                               Place large bowl in freezer at least 1 hour before churning ice cream. Strain the chilled peaches and collect any accumulated juice in a medium bowl. Combine the peach liquid with the cold ice cream custard mixture and stir well. Refrigerate drained peaches until needed. Freeze custard in ice-cream maker following manufacturers directions until thick (like soft-serve ice cream). Scrape ice cream from ice-cream maker into the cold bowl. Quickly add chopped peaches; gently stir until peaches are evenly distributed.                                                          7                               Smooth top of ice cream flat and cover directly with plastic wrap. Cover top of bowl with more plastic wrap and then with foil.

Line 15x10x1-inch pan with cooking parchment paper; set aside.                                                          9                               In bowl of food processor, pulse all topping ingredients 8 times or until nuts and butter are well mixed and crumbly.                                                          10                               Spread crumbs evenly on parchment in pan. Bake 8 minutes and then stir well. Bake 8 minutes longer or until crumbs are golden and crunchy. Do not let crumbs burn. There should be some large crumbs and some small; break up some of the larger chunks if necessary. Cool pan completely on wire rack.                                                          11                               Before serving, remove ice cream from freezer and place in refrigerator about 30 minutes to soften.
