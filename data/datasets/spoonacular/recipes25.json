Blend in salt, pepper and flour, then stir in the milk and Romano cheese. Simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.                            To Make the Garlic Butter: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the garlic, rosemary, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is tender but not browned. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.                            To Make the Dough: Pour the warm water into a small bowl and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Allow to rest until yeast foams, about 5 minutes. Mix the vegetable oil, sugar, salt, rosemary, and garlic powder together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture, and gradually stir in the flour. Gather into a loose ball and knead until a smooth ball forms. Cover, and let rest 1/2 hour.                            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season the roasted chicken with rosemary, thyme, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and salt. Chop or shred and reserve.                            To Assemble the Pizza: Spread dough out on prepared pizza stone. Top with cooled garlic butter, covering entire crust. Next spread with Alfredo Sauce (if necessary, warm to spreading consistency), leaving crust edges. Top with chicken, turning to coat with sauce.                            Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until bottom crust is lightly browned. Remove from oven and let set for 2 to 3 minutes before cutting.

Add chicken and simmer until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow chicken to cool in broth. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove from broth, shred into bite size pieces, and transfer to medium bowl. Strain broth, reserving 3/4 cup and pouring remaining broth over chicken. Set aside.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            In same unwashed saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add leeks, celery, and carrots. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add vegetable mixture to chicken.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            In same saucepan, heat butter on medium heat until melted. Stir in flour until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly, until raw flour aroma is gone and flour is pale golden blond, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly add 1 cup milk and 3/4 cup reserved chicken broth, scraping up any bits that have accumulated on the bottom, and cook until mixture is smooth and comes to boil.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Remove from heat and stir in vegetable/chicken mixture, parsley, and thyme.

(If using canned kidney beans, skip this step.) Turn the heat down, let simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until just-tender. Use the same process for the cannellini beans. In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta, rendering the fat and cooking until slightly crispy about 3 minutes. Saute the onion, celery, carrot and garlic for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Add the diced tomatoes, the cooked and drained kidney beans, cannellini beans, chick peas, and the chicken stock. Using kitchen twine, tie the herbs and the bay leaf into a bundle and add to the pot. Season with the red chili flakes, salt and pepper. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, then add the kale. Continue cooking until the beans are completely tender.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drizzle olive oil over the slices of peasant bread, season with a little salt and pepper and toast in the oven. Serve the soup in large bowls with grated Parmesan and a slice of toast.

flax meal and warm water and place into the refrigerator to gel while you make the cheesecake.Place the soaked cashews into a high-powered blender (make sure you drained the water into the sink first!) along with all of the other ingredients for the cheesecake. Puree until thick, smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as necessary. Set aside while you make the crust. Note: you want to be able to pour the cheesecake onto the crust as SOON as it's out of the oven, which is why it's best to prepare it first.In a large bowl, beat together the coconut oil and maple syrup for the crust, until smooth. Stir in the coconut flour, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt until well mixed.Divide the dough by lightly heaping teaspoons between a 12-cavity mini-cheesecake pan, pressing out evenly.Bake until the the crust just appear set, about 5 minutesWhen the crust has about 2 minutes left to bake, transfer the cashew mixture into a large bowl and pour in the flax eggs from the refrigerator. You want to leave them into the refrigerator as long as possible, so they can really gel up. Stir until the flax is evenly mixed into the cashew cream.Remove the crusts from the oven. Your crust with most likely have risen in a few spots. Just use a small spoon to pack it back down flat, making sure you don't leave any cracks.Immediately fill each cavity, just over 3/4 of the way full, with the pumpkin cashew mixture.Bake until the cheesecakes have slightly risen and the outside appears set and firm, but just a small circle in the center still appears slightly jiggly, about 11-12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on the counter. Then, cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours to overnight to completely set.Once set, place the chocolate and coconut oil and in small, microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave using 30 second intervals on half power, stirring between each interval, until smooth and melted.Drizzle the chocolate over each cheesecake to create a Jack-O-Lantern face (I put my melted chocolate in a small squeeze tube to make it easier.)Stick a mint sprig in the top of each pumpkin to create the stem.DEVOUR.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mini-pumpkin-vegan-cheesecake-jack-o-lanterns-823890", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 40, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "french"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Spinach-Quiche-472268.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 472268, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spinach Quiche", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["drained", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.5, "id": 11264, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "deep dish pie crust", "metaInformation": ["()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg", "unitLong": "9-inch", "unitShort": "9-inch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18945, "unit": "9-inch"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs, beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "frozen spinach", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "thawed", "drained", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spinach-frozen.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 11463, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "3 cloves garlic, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1 (6 ounce) package herb and garlic feta, crumbled", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "garlic herb spreadable cheese", "metaInformation": ["crumbled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 small onion, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["small", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1001009, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 71.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spinach-Quiche/Detail.aspx?src=rss", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 19, "aggregateLikes": 2055, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Pour into the pastry shell, allowing egg mixture to thoroughly combine with spinach mixture.                            Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining Cheddar cheese, and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, until set in center. Allow to stand 10 minutes before serving.

Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap the crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease the crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator.                            In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the strawberries, raspberries, and  blueberries; gently toss until berries are coated. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes.                            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat.                            Roll out the remaining pastry for the top crust. Stir the berry mixture and pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place the top crust over the pie and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges of the crust and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edge of the pie with foil.                            Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil.                            Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

Pour the egg, cream and 3/4 cuppeachesover the dry ingredients and stir with a fork just until the dough, which will be wet and sticky, comes together. Don't overdo it. Still in the bowl, gently knead the dough by hand, or turn it with a rubber spatula 8 to 10 times. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and turn out the dough. Divide it in half. Working with one piece at a time, pat the dough into a rough circle that's about 5 inches in diameter, cut it into 6 wedges and place it on the baking sheet. (At this point, the scones can be frozen on the baking sheet, then wrapped airtight. Don't defrost before baking- just add about 2 minutes to the baking time.)

On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely. Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern. Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.2 You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions. Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.) Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.3 When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil. Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.4 Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme. Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil. Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300\u00b0F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.5 After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.6 When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.7 At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step. To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.8 Serve the brisket, sliced in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices, against the grain of the meat, with the onions, carrots and gravy.

Keep cookie sheet nearby.Once each chocolate is smooth you can spoon them alternately over top of the pretzels on the cookie sheet. Continue to spoon over top until all the chocolate is gone. Now take a butter knife and drag it slowly though the colours to create the marble effect. Make sure you stay on the surface so you are not moving the pretzels about.

Adjust the dough texture by adding flour a few tablespoons at a time or more milk.

Knead the dough for a few minutes (again, by mixer or by hand) and then transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size (the exact time will depend on the temperature of your kitchen).Punch down the dough and roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness on a lightly floured counter. Using a doughnut cutter or a 2-3 inch circle cookie cutter, cut out circles in the dough. Carefully transfer the circles to a parchment- or silpat-lined baking sheet and stamp out the smaller inner circles using a smaller cutter. Be sure to make the holes large enough that as the doughnuts rise again and bake, they don\u2019t fill in the doughnut hole with the puffiness of the dough. Cover the tray with lightly greased plastic wrap. (At this point, you can refrigerate the doughnuts overnight or proceed with the recipe.) Let the doughnuts rise for about another 45 minutes, until they are puffed and nearly doubled.Bake in a 375 degree F oven until the bottoms are just golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Start checking the doughnuts around minute 8. They should still be pale on top, not golden and browned, and just barely baked through.Remove the doughnuts from the oven and let cool for 1-2 minutes.

Add the onions, celery, zucchini, carrots, garlic, and rosemary; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are soft and juicy, about 10 minutes. Add the cabbage, tomatoes, basil, and marjoram and season again with salt and pepper. Cook until cabbage is just tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the beans and vegetable broth, and adjust the heat to simmer gently for 20 minutes. Remove the rosemary sprig. Stir in the bread and spinach, increase the heat to medium and cook until the soup thickens, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into warm bowls. Top with cheese and a little drizzle extra-virgin olive oil. Copyright 2004 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

"instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with sides with olive oil.Separate the stems from the leaves of the Swiss chard and chop both, keeping piles separate.  I like to chop the stems into bite-size pieces and the leaves into pieces 2-3 inches long and across.Toss the chard stems and sliced onions in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with pepper to taste, and spread onto the prepared baking sheet.(I completely omit salt in this recipe as the feta offers sufficient saltiness; if you prefer more, you may always salt at the end.)Bake in the preheated oven until the chard stems have softened and the onion is starting to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir around a little.In the bowl you used to toss the stems and onions, toss the chard leaves and the sliced pepper with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a few more grinds of the pepper mill. Sprinkle the leaves and peppers over the stem mixture, then scatter the feta cheese over top.Return to the oven, and bake until the leaves are beginning to crisp and the feta is starting to turn golden, about 20 minutes.  You may also broil for a minute or so at the end to add a hint of crispiness to the leaves and a touch of golden brown to the feta.
