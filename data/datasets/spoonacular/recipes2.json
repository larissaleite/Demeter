2-quart heavy saucepan, then add rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat and cook, covered, over low heat until rice is tender and grains are split open, 1 to 1 1/4 hours (not all liquid will be absorbed). Drain well in a colander and cool to warm.                                                                            Blend together milk, eggs, 3 tablespoons butter, flour, pepper, remaining teaspoon salt, and 1 cup cooked wild rice in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in scallions and 1 1/2 cups cooked wild rice (reserve remainder for another use). Let batter stand, covered, at room temperature 1 hour.                                    Make sauce while rice cooks:                                        Roast bell peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. (Or broil peppers on a broiler pan about 5 inches from heat, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes.) Transfer to a large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, then let stand 20 minutes.                                                                            When cool enough to handle, peel peppers, discarding stems and seeds, and coarsely chop.                                                                            Pure peppers with water, oil, vinegar, and salt in cleaned blender until smooth. Season with pepper and pour into a small heavy saucepan.                                    Make filling while batter stands:                                        Soak porcini in boiling-hot water in a small bowl until softened, about 20 minutes. Lift porcini out, squeezing liquid back into bowl, then rinse porcini (to remove any grit) and finely chop. Pour soaking liquid through a sieve lined with a dampened paper towel into another small bowl.                                                                            Heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a 12- to 13-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saut porcini and cremini mushrooms, tossing with 2 wooden spatulas or spoons, until wilted and any liquid mushrooms give off is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, and remaining tablespoon butter and saut, stirring, 1 minute. Add porcini soaking liquid and boil until most of liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.                                    Cook and assemble crpes:                                        Line a plate with 1 square of wax paper. Heat crpe pan over moderate heat until hot, then brush lightly with some melted butter. Spoon about 3 tablespoons batter into pan, tilting and rotating to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next crpe.) Cook until underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute, then loosen crpe with a heatproof plastic spatula and flip over with your fingers. Cook crpe until other side is lightly browned, about 1 minute, and transfer to wax-paper-lined plate. Top crpe with another square of wax paper. Make more crpes with remaining batter, brushing pan lightly with butter as needed. (You will have extra crpes.)                                                                            Preheat oven to 400F.                                                                            Brush some melted butter on bottom of a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep). Spread 1/4 cup filling over half of 1 crpe, then fold other half over filling to form a half-moon. Fold half-moon in thirds, overlapping outer sections (see photo, opposite), and transfer to baking pan. Repeat procedure with 11 more crpes, arranging in 1 layer in baking pan.                                                                            Brush crpes generously with remaining melted butter and bake in upper third of oven until outsides are crisp and filling is heated through, about 15 minutes.                                                                            While crpes are baking, heat sauce over low heat until hot, about 5 minutes.                                                                            Put 2 crpes on each of 6 plates and serve with sauce.                                    Cooks' notes:Wild rice can be cooked 2 days ahead and cooled, uncovered, then chilled, covered.Red pepper sauce can be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.Filling cann be made 1 day ahead and cooled, uncovered, then chilled, covered.Crpes can be made and filled 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapeed in foil.

"instructions": "InstructionsIn a heavy-bottomed small saucepan, combine the sugar, lime juice and water and bring to a boil. Boil undisturbed over moderately low heat until a deep amber caramel forms, about 5 minutes.Stir in the minced red chile, garlic and pepper. Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully whisk in the fish sauce and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir over moderate heat until the caramel is smooth, sticky and slightly thick. Pour the sauce into a heatproof bowl and set aside. The sauce can also be saved for later and refrigerated. If the sauce is too thick add a tablespoon of water to thin and warm in the microwave on 10 second intervals.Heat the grill, grill pan or large frying pan to medium-high heat. In a small bowl combine the sesame oil and 1 tablespoon thai red curry paste. Brush the mixture over the mahi mahi. Grill or pan fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove, peel the skin away, chop into chunks and then drizzle with1 tablespoon of caramel.To make the spicy curried mayo, mix together the mayo and thai red curry paste in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.To make the Siracha Mustard, mix together the mustard and Siracha in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until read to use.To assemble, half the baguettes lengthwise and spread a little of the spicy curried mayo over the bottom of each baguette.

Finely chop the parsley, garlic and oregano (can do with a food processor), place in a small bowl. Stir in the vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Set aside two thirds of the sauce for serving with the steak (cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature). The remaining third of the sauce will be for the marinade.2 Place steak in a bowl or large ziplock bag. Take about a third of the prepared chimichurri sauce and coat the steak for a marinade. Cover completely with plastic wrap or remove air from ziplock bag and secure close. Let steak marinate for several hours. Remove steak from refrigerator 2 hours before cooking so that it gets close to room temperature before cooking. Right before cooking, wipe off marinade from steak and sprinkle steak generously with salt and pepper.3a Grilling Instructions Prepare grill so that one side has high, direct heat and another side has indirect heat. Brush grill grates with vegetable oil. Place steak first on the side of the grill with high, direct heat, so that it sears. Grill for a minute or two on each side, enough to brown the meat. Then transfer the steak to the indirect heat side of the grill. Cover the grill, try to maintain a grill temperature of 350\u00b0F. Cook for 5-10 minutes (or more) until the steak is cooked to your desired level of doneness. You can use the finger test to check for doneness, or a meat thermometer. For rare, pull the meat off the gril at an internal temp of 120\u00b0F. For medium rare, 125-130\u00b0F. Remove the meat to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.3b Stovetop/Oven Instructions Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Heat a large cast iron skillet on medium high to high heat. Hold the steak fat-side down to render a little of the fat into the pan. Then sear each side until nicely browned, about a minute or two each. Transfer the steak (if using cast iron pan, can place the whole pan in the oven) to the oven to finish to desired doneness, anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness and size of the steak and how well done you like it. You can use the finger test to check for doneness, or a meat thermometer. For rare, pull the meat out of the oven at an internal temp of 120\u00b0F. For medium rare, 125-130\u00b0F. Remove the meat to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.

    Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Fold two 12- by 18-inch squares of heavy duty aluminum foil in half cross-wise. Crimp the left and right edges to form a tight seal (leave the top open). Toss beets with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Divide evenly between both foil pouches. Add 2 sprigs rosemary or thyme to each pouch, then tightly crimp top of pouch to seal.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Place pouches on a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Cook until beets are completely tender and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into a beet through the foil pouch shows no resistance, about 1 hour. Open pouches and allow beets to cool for 30 minutes. Peel under cold running water (the skin should slip right off). Cut beets into rough 1 1/2-inch chunks.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Combine vinegar, agave nectar, half of pinenuts, and shallots in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil followed by walnut oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Toss beets with half of dressing in a large bowl, then transfer to a serving plate. Add grapefruit, orange, and arugula leaves to bowl along with 1 more tablespoon dressing. Toss and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving plate with beets. Drizzle remaining dressing around beets, sprinkle with remaining pinenuts, top with orange zest, and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Once oil is hot, crumble beef into oil, add onions and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up beef when stirring, until beef has browned and cooked through. Drain fat from beef and return to skillet (my mom doesn't drain the fat, she says it gives it more flavor so you can leave it if you'd like). Stir in garlic, chili powder, paprika, cumin, kidney beans, canned diced tomatoes and green chilis then season mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, uncovered for 10-15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, spoon mixture over Navajo Fry bread, then top with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream (and any of the other optional toppings listed). Serve immediately.In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, yeast and salt. Whisk melted butter into warm milk and pour milk mixture into dry ingredients. Stir until mixture comes together and forms a ball, dough should be slightly sticky and elastic so add an up to an additional 1/4 cup milk as needed. Cover dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest 10 minutes. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large cast iron skillet to 350 - 360 degrees over stove top. Divide rested dough into 10 equal pieces. Working with floured hands and one piece of dough at a time (keep other pieces covered with plastic wrap), roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 5 - 6-inch circle and gently drop into hot oil, and cook until golden brown, then rotate and cook opposite side until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain onto a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Serve warm with Navajo Taco topping or for dessert, spread with honey butter.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/moms-navajo-tacos-and-indian-fry-bread-543900", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Just as Delish", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grilled-Lemongrass-Beef-497874.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 497874, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Grilled Lemongrass Beef", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Just as Delish", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bd Red Bird Chili -

Layer the rutabaga, carrots, potatoes and leek in the cooker (in this order for even cooking). Add enough hot water (4 to 5 cups) to cover the meat by at least 1 inch, put the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high, 7 to 8 hours.Remove the meat and vegetables from the slow cooker and keep warm. Put the cabbage in a microwave-safe dish with 2 cups cooking liquid from the slow cooker, cover and microwave until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, boil another cup of cooking liquid in a small skillet until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Mix with the horseradish and creme fraeche in a small bowl.Slice the corned beef and serve with the slow-cooked vegetables, cabbage and sauce; reserve about a quarter each of the meat and vegetables and 1 1/2 cups cooking liquid for Corned Beef Hash.Photograph by Antonis Achilleos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

Cut the Brussels sprouts in half lengthwise, from top to bottom. Toss the sprouts with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the red pepper flakes on a baking sheet. Put in the oven and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Toast the pine nuts on a separate baking sheet in the oven for the last 5 minutes of roasting the sprouts.While the sprouts are roasting, put the bacon in a small saute pan with a splash of olive oil and bring the pan to medium heat. Cook the bacon until crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the pan.Toss the roasted Brussels sprouts with the crispy bacon and toasted pine nuts. Using a peeler, shave a few slices of parmigiano on top.Photograph by Ryan Liebe                                                    Recipe courtesy of Anne Burrell for Food Network Magazine

Add the wild rice to a medium saucepan with 5 cups of the chicken broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook until the rice has just started to break open and is slightly tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Set aside.Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the broccoli by throwing the florets into the boiling water until bright green and still slightly crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain the broccoli and plunge it into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove it from the ice water and set aside.Heat a large pot over medium-high heat, then melt 6 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushrooms and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid begins to evaporate, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the carrots and celery and cook until the vegetables are soft and the mixture begins to turn darker in color, 3 to 4 minutes.Sprinkle the flour on the vegetables, stir to incorporate it and cook for about a minute. Pour in the remaining 3 cups of broth and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow it to thicken, about 3 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Let the mixture cook until it thickens. Add the salt and pepper, then taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Mix together the cooked rice and broccoli and tip into a 2-quart baking dish. Using a ladle, scoop out the vegetable/broth mixture and spoon it evenly all over the top, totally covering the surface with the vegetables.Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, then pour it into a separate bowl with the panko breadcrumbs. Toss the mixture together to coat the breadcrumbs in butter, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs all over the top of the casserole.Cover with foil and bake the casserole for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until golden brown on top, another 15 minutes. Sprinkle on the parsley after you remove it from the oven.

"instructions": "Thaw a sheet of puff pastry (let it sit on counter for an hour or two).Start by caramelizing your shallots. Heat up the butter in a medium pan and when it bubbles, throw the shallots in and cook on medium high for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Bring the heat down to medium low and continue cooking for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the shallow are fully cooked and sweet (taste them).Preheat your oven at 400F.Cut your puff pastry in two, to have to rectangles.On a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, place your two puff pastry rectangles.With the tip of your fingers, lightly humidify the boarders of each rectangle with water and gently fold about 1/4 of an inch of the board inward and press down just enough so it stays in place. This will create a nice crust around your tart.With the back or a spoon, spread 1 1/2 tbsp of dijon on each tart. layer some spinach on top of the dijon, slightly overlapping each other but not piling them up.Put a generous layer of caramelized shallots on each tart, spreading them evenly on the surface.Place slices of brie side by side on each rectangle, enough to cover the tarts, about 6 pieces on each.Divide the tomatoes in two and place them on top of the brie on each tart. Do the same with the peas.You can brush the crust with egg wash to make it brown a bit more as well as make it shiny. I don't personally like the taste of the cooked egg yolk but it's up to you!Season to taste and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.Take it out of the oven and cut each tart into 4 servings.Enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/brie-and-caramelized-shallots-puff-pastry-brie-tart-546740", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": true, "readyInMinutes": 65, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/20-Minute-Bruschetta-Chicken-Skillet-602880.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 602880, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "20-Minute Bruschetta-Chicken Skillet", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup croutons, coarsely crushed", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "croutons", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/croutons.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18242, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh basil", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup KRAFT\u00ae Shredded Low-Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "Low Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-white.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1029, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup KRAFT\u00ae Grated Parmesan Cheese, divided", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["divided", "grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (1 lb.)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breasts", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1055062, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1 can (14-1/2 oz.)

Allow fillo dough to thaw in refrigerator overnight. Bring to room temperature before using.2. Carefully unroll fillo sheets onto a smooth, dry surface.3. Cover fillo completely with plastic wrap, then a damp towel.4. Keep fillo covered until needed. Do not leave uncovered for more than one minute to avoid drying out.5. Microwave butter until melted. This will give you a lighter and flakier pastry.6. Brush each layer of fillo with melted butter, margarine or oil.7. To prevent edges from cracking, brush edges first and then work into center.8. Be sure to brush the last layer of fillo with melted butter.9. Fillings should be chilled and not excessively moist.10.

"instructions": "There is an optional step to making this stew taken from classic French cooking  (Antonin Careme) that transforms a good dish into a great one. Mash the rabbit or chicken\u2019s liver, mix it with cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream, then push it through a fine sieve. The result is a pink slurry that will thicken and enrich your sauce. If you choose to take this step, do not let your stew boil once the liver-cr\u00e8me fraiche mixture is in it or it will curdle. If you want to go halfway with this final step, mix in a large dollop of cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream in at the end. 1 Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in 2 cups hot water.2 Cut the rabbit into serving pieces and salt well. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Use all of the rabbit in this dish \u2013 you can fish out the ribs and other parts that have little or no meat on them later; they will add vital flavor to your stew.3 Optional Step If you are going to make the cr\u00e8me fraiche-liver thickener, mince the rabbit liver finely and move it to a small bowl. Vigorously mix in about 1 1/2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream. Now put the mixture into a fine-meshed sieve over a bowl and push it through with a rubber spatula. Reserve in the fridge.4 Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.  Slice the top third off the heads of garlic and drizzle the olive oil over them. Wrap the heads loosely in foil and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until cloves are soft and brown. Set aside to cool.5 Chop off the tough ends of the mushroom stems and either discard or save for stock. Roughly chop or slice the mushrooms and set aside. Dice the rehydrated porcini. Pour the porcini soaking water though a paper towel into another bowl. Reserve the liquid.6 Heat a thick-bottomed large pot on high heat for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and shake the pot. Stirring continuously, dry saut\u00e9 the mushrooms until they release their water. Turn the heat down to medium-high. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any mushroom bits off the bottom of the pan. Salt the mushrooms lightly. When the mushroom liquid is mostly gone, remove them to a bowl.7 Add the butter to the pot. When the butter melts, turn the heat down to medium. Pat the rabbit pieces dry and place in the pan.  Work in batches if you need to, do not crowd the pan. Brown the pieces well on all sides.  Remove the rabbit pieces from the pot and set aside.8 Increase the the heat to medium-high and add the shallots to the pot. Saut\u00e9 until the shallots are nicely wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir from time to time. Sprinkle salt over everything.9 While the shallots are cooking, squeeze the roasted garlic into the mushroom soaking water you have strained, then whisk it together. 10 Add the sherry or white wine to the shallots in the pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape off any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Let the sherry boil down by half. Add the mushroom-roasted garlic mixture and the stock and stir to combine. Add the thyme, all the mushrooms, the rabbit and the parsnips and bring everything to a bare simmer. 11 Simmer gently for  90 minutes. You want the meat to be close to falling off the bone. If you want, you can fish out all the rabbit pieces and pull the meat off the bone \u2013 it makes the dish less attractive, but it will be easier to eat. Taste for salt right before you serve and add if needed. Stir in the parsley.12 If you are using the cr\u00e8me fraiche-liver mixture to thicken your stew, turn off the heat. When the stew stops bubbling, add the mixture and let it heat through for a minute before serving. Serve with a crusty loaf of bread, a green salad and either a hearty white wine, a dry rose or a light red wine.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/rabbit-stew-with-mushrooms-245591",

On a sheet of waxed paper, sift the cake flour with 3/4 cup of the sugar and the cocoa 4 times.Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites along with a pinch of salt until foamy, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cream of tartar over the egg whites and continue to beat until they hold a soft peak, about 5 minutes. Beating continuously, add the vanilla and gradually stream in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, until the egg whites are thick, glossy and stiff.Remove the bowl from the mixer, and using a spatula, gradually fold in the flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, until there are no more pockets of dry ingredients. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 9-inch tube pan. Bake until the cake springs back when pressed with your finger, about 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, invert, and allow the cake to cool on a rack 1 hour before loosening the cake from the pan with a knife and unmolding.Meanwhile, make the strawberries: Sprinkle the sliced strawberries with the sugar. Stir to coat and let stand about 30 minutes to allow the juices to develop.

Save your whites in your fridge and use them to make macrons or angel food cake or egg white omelets\u2026 either way, you don\u2019t want to just throw them down the drain.In a large sauce pan combine the sugar and whole milk stir to combine. Place over medium-low heat. Carefully stir and watch that is doesn\u2019t ever come to a boil.Cut your vanilla bean length wise and scrape out the vanilla caviar and place in the milk, sugar mixture. Then add the entire vanilla bean as well. Continue to gently stir. Heat the mixture until it is hot, but not boiling.Add the yolks to a large bowl and whisk for 2 minutes until the yolks become a lighter color.Now you need to temper the egg yolks with a couple of ladles full of the hot milk and sugar mixture. You need to do this so that your eggs don\u2019t become scrambled eggs in the hot milk. Once your egg yolks are tempered or brought up to temperature, slowly stir them into the hot milk. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken. You can tell that it\u2019s ready when it coats the back of a spoon.Using a fine mesh strainer, strain your mixture into a large glass bowl. Discard any lumps.Slowly stir in the heavy cream.At this point you need to put your base into the refrigerator for at least an hour to chill before you attempt to churn it in your ice cream maker.Prepare your Strawberries while you are waiting for the base to chill. Cut your strawberries into bite sized pieces and place in a bowl.Cover with sugar and Jell-o powder and let them macerate in the fridge for an hour or so.For the basic vanilla ice cream, all you need to do is churn the ice cream base in your ice cream maker following the directions for the specific machine.Once the ice cream base has churned for 10-15 minutes and it is the consistency of soft serve ice cream, slowly pour your strawberry mixture into the churning mixture.Next, add the pretzels and let church for a few more minutes.Your ice cream will still be pretty soft when it is finished churning and will need more time in the freezer before you serve.I line a bread pan with plastic wrap and scoop my ice cream in the bread pan, cover and place in the freezer for 3-4 hours before serving.

Let simmer for 30 minutes.Yield: 8 servings                                                Brown Roux:                                        Melt the butter in a saute pan. When the butter is melted, add the flour and stir to combine. Cook slowly over low heat, stirring constantly, until the roux gets dark brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Don't rush it or the roux could burn and become bitter tasting.

Cover and refrigerate, but bring to room temperature before using.)Make the salad3. In a medium-size bowl, mix the lentils with the scallions, carrots, celery, and cucumber. Add the dressing and mix gently. Add a little salt, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Let sit for at least 15 minutes and preferably up to 1 hour at room temperature.Assemble4.

                                              For the crostatas: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.In a medium mixing bowl, combine the peaches, rhubarb, lime juice, triple sec, vanilla and 1/3 cup of the sugar.Unfold the puff pastry dough onto a floured work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Using a round cutter or a 6-inch circular template, cut 4 circles into the dough and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Fold 1/2 inch of the dough over itself all around the edge of each circle, crimping it with your fingers to create a thin border. Using a fork, pierce the pastry dough all over.Using a slotted spoon to leave excess liquid behind, spoon some of the fruit mixture into the center of each circle. Using a pastry brush, brush each pastry edge with some of the remaining fruit liquid and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the centers are bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.While the crostatas are baking, reduce the remaining fruit liquid in a small pot to a syrupy consistency, about 5 minutes.For the creme fraiche: In a small bowl, whisk together the creme fraiche, agave and lime zest and juice until soft peaks form.Remove the crostatas from the oven and spoon the fruit syrup over the top as a glaze. Allow to cool slightly before serving with a dollop of the creme fraiche and a sprig of mint.

   Place the coconut and several drops of green food coloring in a large bowl. Using your hands (if you do, wear gloves) or a wooden spoon, mix until the green color is evenly distributed. Depending on the type of dye you are using, add more drops and stir until the color has reached your desired hue of green.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Add the sugar, flour, and salt, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture is evenly distributed.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Stir in the egg whites and vanilla, once again stirring until evenly distributed; the mixture should be wet and somewhat sticky and thick.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on your prepared sheet. Using your hands, shape the mounds into as much of a Christmas tree shape as you can--kind of pinch it into a point on top. They will flatten a bit during baking, but the general shape should hold. If desired, sprinkle on red sprinkles to resemble little ornaments on the trees; star-shaped sprinkles can be added on the top of each mound.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until they appear solid when lightly poked (it will be hard to detect light browning because of the green color). Remove cookies from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, add whatever other decorations you'd like: garlands or \"lights\" drawn in with writing icing, for instance.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/christmas-tree-coconut-macaroons-205745", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eggless Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/vegan-carrot-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting-247031.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 18, "id": 247031, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Vegan Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Eggless Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3/4 cup almond milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "almond milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 93607, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups grated carrots", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11124, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup coconut oil", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 4047, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "coconut oil -

Pop the burgers on a plate until you are ready to use them. You can bake or fry them in a little oil. I fried my burger in a little cold pressed rapeseed oil, for a few minutes on each side until brown and crisp.7. These burgers will also freeze well.

Then strain both jars of the fermenting kefir into the third clean jar with the fresh fruit in it, straining out the kefir grains ( set them aside) filling the jar to a  inch from the top. Then cover tightly with a lid, and leave on the counter another 24 hours. Your kefir will start bubbling.I will tell you that these metal lids like in this photo, are not ideal. The plastic lids are best.The water kefir is creating gas and building pressure, which you want it to do - this makes it nice and bubbly, but with the metal lids, you must let out some of the pressure, \"burping it\" every 6 hours or so, so the lid doesn't bend open ( yes this happened to me). With a plastic lid, it stays on fine.After 24 hours, the fruit will float the the surface and it's time to refrigerate it. Once it's chilled, give it a try. You can eat the fruit, it won't hurt you, but I generally just strain it as I pour.The kefir grains that you strained out earlier can be stored in a smaller jar, in the fridge in sugar water or the extra kefir water you will have after you merge the two jars into one.
