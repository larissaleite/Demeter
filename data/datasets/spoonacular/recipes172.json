You should use half of the streusel.6) Top streusel with the rest of the batter. Then add the final 1/2 of the streusel to the muffins. It's okay if they overflow a bit out of the muffin tins.7) Bake muffins for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees until they a tester comes out dry.8) For icing, whisk together milk and powdered sugar.9) Let muffins cool for a few minutes and then remove them from tin. Let them cool for another 10 minutes and then drizzle on icing.10) Serve immediately or store in an airtight container.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/coffee-cake-muffins-536347", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Closet Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Maple-Glazed-Bacon-Wrapped-Roasted-Carrots-681940.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 681940, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Maple Glazed Bacon Wrapped Roasted Carrots", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 157.85, "creditText": "Closet Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 pound bacon", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10123, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "2 pounds carrots, well scrubbed or peeled", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "scrubbed", "well"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11124, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19911, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 70.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.closetcooking.com/2015/10/maple-glazed-bacon-wrapped-roasted.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/wire-rack.jpg", "id": 405900, "name": "wire rack"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Wrap the carrots in the bacon.Arrange on a wire rack on a baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400F/200C oven until the bacon is crispy and the carrots are tender, about 20-30 minutes, glazing with the maple syrup half way through.

If you are using the more tender-skinned Meyer lemons, you can proceed to the next step without letting them sit, as the skins don't need the sugar to tenderize them.On a floured surface or between two pieces of plastic wrap, roll out the tart dough to fill a 10 inch tart or pie pan.Line a 10-inch tart pan (the kind with a removable bottom) with the tart dough, easing it into the bottom and sides and leaving a half-inch overhang. Set aside.In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and salt together until blended. Add the eggs to the lemon mixture, mixing thoroughly. Pour the mixture into the pastry-lined tart pan. The mixture will be very liquid, so you must evenly distribute the lemon pieces in the pan.Using your hands press the edges of the tart dough into the edge of the tart pan causing the dough to tear right at the edge.Then use a small pastry brush to take some of the egg liquid from the pie to brush the rim of the pastry so that it comes out with a nice shine. Chill for about 30 minutes. (Chilling the assembled pie is to firm up the pockets of butter in the dough, so that when the pie is put into the oven, the butter pockets will melt, creating the flaky texture you want in your finished dough.) While the pie is chilling, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F (180C).Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and place the tart pan on the lined baking sheet. Bake the pie until it is light gold on top and filling is bubbling about 45-50 minutes. If the top is coloring too quickly, place a piece of foil or parchment loosely over the top. Let the pie cool completely before slicing to allow the filling to set properly. Serve at room temperature or slightly warmed (though the pie needs to cool completely for the filling to set up, it can be warmed up a little in the oven before serving). The pie will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/meyer-lemon-shaker-pie-from-tartine-509092", "dishTypes": ["fingerfood", "antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Copy Kat", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Yorkshire-pudding--a-famous-English-dish-you-can-make-easily-at-home-599476.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 599476, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Yorkshire pudding \u2013 a famous English dish you can make easily at home", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 8.17, "creditText": "Copy Kat", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup of bacon drippings", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon drippings", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 4609, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 egg, well-beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose", "sifted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 18.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.copykat.com/2009/05/13/yorkshire-pudding-a-famous-english-dish-you-can-make-easily-at-home/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Temp: 450 F Time: 10 - 15 min.

Turn the bread out of the pan and let cool completely on the rack. Wrap in plastic wrap. The banana bread is best if served the next day.                                                            Banana bread is easy to make-just a few simple steps-and irresistible to eat. We recommend making a few extra loaves, wrapping in plastic, and freezing. Thaw at room temperature for an hour and you'll have fresh banana bread ready to go by the time everyone wakes up. Freezing individual slices works well, too.
