a creamy butternut parmesan sauce and baked in the oven with even more cheese  trust me, you want these in your life!Last year I fell in love with creamy butternut squash as a pasta sauce and have had this on my mind ever since. Now that the Fall is here it was the perfect time to play around with this idea.They turned out as good as I could have imagined, even my teen daughter who is pretty picky loved these! And, they are meatless so they're perfect for meatless mondays. Use gluten free noodles to make them gluten free or whole wheat for added whole grain.
