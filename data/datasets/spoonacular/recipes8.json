Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature (about 15 minutes). You may also stick the chocolate/butter mixture into the refrigerator to cool to room temperature quicker.Stir sugar into cooled chocolate/butter mixture until combined. Add in the eggs one at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla. Gently fold in the flour and salt. Pour batter into prepared pan, reserving 1/4 cup of batter.Make the cheesecake swirl:\u00a0With a hand-held mixer on medium speed, beat the softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, egg yolk, and raspberry preserves in a medium bowl until completely smooth - about 1 minute. If you'd like a pinker cheesecake layer, add 2-3 drops of red food coloring. Dollop spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture on top of the prepared brownie batter. Drizzle with the last 1/4 cup of brownie batter. Glide a knife through the layers, creating a swirl pattern. Press a few raspberries into the top.Bake brownies for 35-45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out almost clean - which may be shorter or longer. Just keep your eye on them and test with a toothpick. Mine took exactly 35 minutes. Cover the brownies after 20 minutes to avoid the top from browning too much and too quickly. Allow brownies to cool completely before cutting into squares, at least 4 hours. I set mine on the counter for 30 minutes, then in the refrigerator for 2 hours which sped up the process.

One of the most popular brands is called Swans Down Cake Flour, which is packaged in a bright red box.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baked-mini-buttermilk-doughnuts-with-nutella-glaze-516093", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 16, "servings": 24, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Coconut-Chip-Cookies-408522.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 408522, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Coconut Chip Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/3 cup canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 4582, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup flaked coconut", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "coconut", "metaInformation": ["flaked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12104, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts or almonds", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "macadamia nuts", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/macadamia-nuts.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12131, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semisweet chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10019903, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 package white cake mix (regular size)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white cake mix", "metaInformation": ["white", "(regular size)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cake-mix.jpg", "unitLong": "package", "unitShort": "pkg", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18137, "unit": "package"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 17.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/coconut-chip-cookies", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 146, "instructions": "Directions                                                                                In a large bowl, beat cake mix, eggs and oil (batter will be very stiff).

Pour vinegar and warm water over onion. Stir in sugar and season with a pinch of salt; let stand for about 30 minutes or until slightly pickled. Drain and set aside. (Onions can be pickled up to 2 days ahead and stored, covered in the refrigerator.)Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, cook the quinoa in boiling water until just tender, about 10 minutes (or according to your package instructions). Drain and spread on a baking sheet to cool.In a bowl, combine eggs, carrot, cheese, chives, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix in the cooled quinoa and bread crumbs. Let stand for 10 minutes.Form quinoa into 1/2-inch-thick patties; you should get about 12 slider-sized patties or 6 larger ones.

Once hot, reduce the temperature to medium-high and place the turkey onto the hot grill grates. Close the lid and grill the turkey for 6-8 minutes.

Slice the butternut squash in half through the long side.  Set both halves on a cookie sheet, then cook in the preheated oven until the squash is soft, about 30 minutes.  (This could be less or more, depending on the size of your squash.  You can check to see if it is done by piercing it with a fork.  It will be soft when it is done.)  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.When cool, process in a food processor until smooth.  Weigh out 12 ounces, and store away the rest of the squash for another use.In a large saucepan, bring the chicken broth plus 1 cup water to a boil over medium-high heat.  Turn the heat down to low and allow to simmer.In a large skillet, heat the olive oil.  Add in the onion and cook until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the rice and toast for 3 minutes.Add 2 ladlefuls of the warm broth to the rice and stir until the liquid evaporates. Repeat with the remaining broth, cooking until the risotto is creamy, about 20 minutes.  During the last 3 minutes of cooking, stir in the butternut squash puree.  Season with the nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Stir in the butter and cheese, stir until combined, then serve, topped with the sage.Recipe adapted from Every Day with Rachael Ray November 2007", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/saturdays-with-rachael-ray-butternut-squash-risotto-474828", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 90, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": ["south american", "latin american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/carne_asada-26483.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 26483, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Carne Asada", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, roughly chopped", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chipotle peppers in adobo", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/canned-chipotle-chili.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11632, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cilantro", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11165, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp minced garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped green onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green onions", "metaInformation": ["green", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11291, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp ground cumin", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cumin", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002014, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp fresh ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground pepper", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 tsps kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1082047, "unit": "tsps"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup fresh lime juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9160, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup chopped onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onions", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 11282, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "parsley", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11297, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 lbs skirt steak", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skirt steak", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flank-steak.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.5, "id": 23167, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup tomato pur\u00e9e", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "tomato puree", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11547, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup canola or vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "From Joseph Martin, executive chef, Levy Restaurants at Dodger Stadium.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.In a large cast iron pot or heavy-bottomed braising pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp and fat is rendered. Remove bacon and drain on paper towel.

Cook until onions are translucent. Next add the chicken, celery, and garlic, parsley, and 3/4 cup chopped green onions. Cook until chicken is cooked through, about 5 to 7 more minutes. Add the cayenne and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the water, cover and let sit for 1 hour.Cut bread lengthwise and place in oven to toast lightly.Spoon some of the pork mixture on the bread bottoms, top each with slices of cheese, the reserved bacon and the remaining green onions and finish with the bread tops.

Using a handheld slicer or mandoline, slice the vegetables as thinly as possible and no thicker than 1/16 to 1/8 inch. It\u2019s imperative that you slice the chips evenly so they cook at the same rate. Group the vegetables by type into separate bowls of ice water and set aside for 30 minutes.2. In a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat the oil to 300\u00baF (150\u00baC).3. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining them with multiple layers of paper towels or a brown paper bag cut open.4. Drain and pat each group of vegetables completely dry using paper towels. (You can use clean kitchen towels if you\u2019d like to save a tree, but you probably want to use paper towels on the beets as they stain something awful.) 5. Fry the vegetables in small batches, adding just a handful of chips at a time. (I suggest frying the beets last because they can stain the oil slightly and make all the chips a little rosy.) Fry the chips, stirring the vegetables gently using a long slotted spoon or stir-fry spider or chopstick to ensure even browning, until lightly golden and crisp, 2 to 5 minutes per batch. Try to maintain the temperature between 300\u00baF (150\u00baC) and no more than 325\u00baF (170\u00baC) so the chips don\u2019t scorch. The exact cooking time will vary depending on the oil temperature and thickness of chips. When the chips are crisp, remove them from the fryer with tongs or a slotted spoon, allowing excess oil to drain away before placing the chips on the paper towels or bags. Salt the hot chips immediately and start the next batch of vegetables.6.

Liberally prepare 3 9-inch round cake pans with the nonstick method of your choice. (I recommend the parchment method described on p. 17.)In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the butter for 2 minutes on high speed. Slowly add the granulated sugar. Cream together for an additional 5 minutes, until very pale yellow and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, combining well after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.Turn your mixer down to its lowest speed and slowly add the flour in 2 batches. Add the salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Be careful not to overbeat. Add the sour cream, oil, and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix the batter until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. The finished batter should be pale yellow and have a silky texture.Evenly pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 27 to 32 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a layer comes out cleanbut just barely. It is crucial that this cake not be overbaked! The layers should have a rich golden color and a spongy texture.Let the layers cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks. Let cool to room temperature. Lightly cover the layers with foil or plastic wrap so they do not dry out.In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the butter and beat for 2 minutes on high speed.Turn your mixer down to low speed and slowly add the confectioners sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.Once everything is fully incorporated (the frosting will look crumbly), turn your mixer back up to high speed. Add the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Whip until the frosting is fluffy and smooth.Once the layers are completely cooled, place 1 layer on a serving plate. Spread just the top of the layer with 1/3 of the frosting (please refer to the Basic Frosting Instructions on p. 18). Add the second layer and spread with another 1/3 of the frosting. Add the final layer, bottom-side up, and spread with the remaining frosting.

You will need two 8-by-8-inch pans or similar. In the first, combine the flour, baking powder, pepper, salt and cumin. In the second, whisk together the egg and milk.Dip each meatloaf slice into the egg mixture; shake off any excess. Then coat in the flour mixture; again, shake off the excess. Place on a wire rack.Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1/4 inch of coconut oil. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 325 degrees F. Add the dredged meatloaf; cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on a wire rack and let cool.Build the sandwich in this order: bread, mayonnaise, meatloaf, lettuce, green tomato jam, bread, smile! Just kiddinga smile isn't in the recipe; however, if you make it to this step, you will surely provide the smile!                                                Green Tomato Jam:                                        Add the green tomatoes and garlic to a food processor. Blend to a paste, then transfer to a medium saucepan along with the sugar, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, cardamom and ginger. Stir to combine. Cook over medium-low heat until the mixture begins to look thick and glossy, about 35 minutes; stir frequently with a heat-resistant spatula to keep the jam from scorching on the bottom. Remove from the heat and let cool. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
