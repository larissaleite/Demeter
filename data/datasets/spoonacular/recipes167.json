Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 2 hours - or overnight if possible.In a small saucepan, bring dried cherries,bourbon, cinnamon, and 1/2 cup water to a boil.Reducethe heat andsimmeruntil most of liquid is absorbed, about 5-7 minutes. Pour the warm cherry mixture into acleanfood processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Stir in walnuts and the remaining 2/3 cupsugar.Working with 1 disk of dough at a time, on a floured surface, roll out dough into a 12-inch circle. Spread with half the filling, leaving a 1-inch border. Cut into 16 wedges using a pizza cutter - it was the fastest and easiest way. Starting from outside edge, tightly roll each wedge up, like a croissant. Place each cookie on a silicone mat or parchment-lined baking sheets, seam side down. Lightly brush with an egg wash made of one egg and a tablespoon of water beaten together. Freeze the cookies for30 minutes before baking.Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Bake one sheet of cookies at a time 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown.

Store in an airtight container until needed.Make Pate a choux and chouquettesPlace a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375F (190C) or 350F (175C) for convection.Combine the water, milk, butter, sugar and salt in a medium pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat.Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Continue to stir the dough until it begins to dry and you see a film start to form at the bottom of the pot as the result of the dough sticking. 1 or 2 minutes.Transfer the dough to a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. If you don't have a mixer, use a heatproof spatula to mix the dough. Add the eggs one at a time and mix on low speed, making sure each egg is full incorporated before adding the next. This may seem difficult at first, but eventually the batter will loosen up.Cut the tip of a piping bag to snugly fit a #803 plain tip. using a rubber spatula, place 2 large scoops of choux dough in the bag so that it is one third full. Push the dough down toward the tip of the bag.Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle about  inch above the pan, pipe dots of choux dough about 1 inches in diameter, spacing it about 1 inch apart. Continue piping until all the choux dough has been used, refilling the piping bag as necessary.Using a pastry brush or the tips of your fingers, lightly brush the egg wash onto the choux. sprinkle the caramelized popcorn over the choux completely covering the surface. Do the same with the pearl sugar. Using your fingers, press thepopcorn and pearl sugar into the choux to ensure that they stick as the choux bake.Bake the choux on the center rack for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and bake for 10 minutes more. When finished, the choux will be golden brown and feel light to the touch. When broken open, the choux should be mostly hollow.Let the choux sit on the parchment paper until cool. When cool, remove gently from the parchment with your fingers.NOTE: These did not puff up for me so I have decided to call them Popcorn Chouquette Cookies.

Reduce the heat to low, add 1/2 cup of the remaining olive oil, and cook without stirring until the juices released from the vegetables have boiled down and the pan is almost dry, about 15 minutes. Break the tomatoes up into the pan. Add the Parmigiano- Reggiano rind(s), and 1 cup of water, and cook the soup at a low simmer for 21/2 to 3 hours, adding another cup of water from time to time so the vegetables are always barely covered with water, until the root vegetables are very tender but not disintegrated. When the vegetables are done, continue to cook until there is no water left in the pan and the soup is stiff enough that you can stand a wooden spoon straight up in it.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Transfer the soup to a large mixing bowl and remove and discard the Parmigiano-Reggiano rind(s). Add the bread and beat it vigorously into the soup with a wooden spoon so it breaks up and is suspended in the soup. If you have large chunks of bread in the soup, it will cause the patties to fall apart when you fry them. Set the soup aside to cool to room temperature, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the soup to an airtight container and refrigerate it overnight or for at least 1 hour. The soup can be made to this point up to five days in advance.\u00a0                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Scoop out 1 cup of soup and mold the soup between your palms as you would a hamburger patty, forming a square patty about 1 inch thick, and place it on a baking sheet. Repeat, forming the remaining soup patties in the same way. Cover the baking sheet tightly with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to chill the patties for at least 30 minutes before frying them. The patties can be formed up to one day in advance.\u00a0                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium- high heat until the oil is almost smoking and slides easily in the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Add two or three of the soup patties, making sure to leave enough room so you can slide a spatula under and flip the patties. Fry the patties on the first side until they\u2019re crisp and almost black in places, 5 to 6 minutes. Carefully turn the patties and cook them on the second side for 2 minutes. Transfer the patties without turning them (the crisp side will be facing up) to a baking sheet and place them in the oven while you fry the remaining patties in the same way, adding more olive oil to the pan as needed, and adding the fried patties to the baking sheet in the oven as they\u2019re done. After the last patties have been fried, leave them all in the oven for 5 minutes to make sure the last batch is warmed through.\u00a0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Remove the patties from the oven and place each one on a plate with the crisp side facing up. Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon of the finishing-quality olive oil. Use a microplane or another fine grater to grate a generous layer of Parmigiano-Reggiano over each patty, and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
