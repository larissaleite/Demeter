If so, blend up some oats in your food processor using the S-blade. Blend until the oats have a fine, flour-like texture. Transfer the oats to a bowl for later.To make the burgers: Use your food processor's grating blade to coarsely grate the carrot. Transfer the shredded carrot to a bowl for now. Remove the grating blade and switch to the S-blade. Cut the halved onion into a few slices before adding the onion and garlic cloves to the food processor. Pulse until the onions are roughly chopped, but no more.Add to the food processor: towel-dried lentils and chickpeas, eggs, oats, handful of herbs (optional), all of the spices, salt and black pepper. Process only until the mixture has the consistency of a chunky hummus (err on the conservative side here). Stir in the grated carrot.To prepare the burgers: Divide the lentil mixture into 6 portions and shape them into patties about 1-inch thick (if your mixture is unmanageably wet, stir in a couple tablespoons of oat flour first). Dust the patties lightly with flour on both sides.To cook the burgers: Heat a thin layer of oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, cook the veggie burgers in batches. Cook until the burgers are crispy on the bottoms and the mixture holds together, about 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the burgers carefully with a spatula and continue cooking until the second sides are firm and brown, about 4 to 5 more minutes. Transfer the burgers to a plate, then add more oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining burgers until they are all cooked through.To make the avocado green harissa: First, clean out the bowl of your food processor. Then add all of the harissa ingredients to the food processor except for the olive oil. Turn on the food processor and drizzle in the olive oil while it's running.To assemble the burgers: Toast your buns, if you'd like. Top the lower bun with a veggie burger patty, then spread a generous amount of avocado green harissa on top.

Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and toss with currants and almonds.Tips & NotesTips: To toast slivered or sliced nuts, cook in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.To have the most success cooking whole-grain rice, use a pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on your coolest (or simmer) burner, making sure the rice is simmering at the lowest bubble. When preparing a recipe that calls for less than 1 cup of dry rice, like this pilaf, we found that the cooking time varied greatly depending on what stove we used: it was sometimes done in as little as 30 minutes and burned at 50 minutes. So, when cooking a small batch of rice, start checking it after 30 minutes to make sure it doesnt burn.NutritionPer serving: 199 calories; 7 g fat (1 g sat, 4 g mono);0 mg cholesterol; 32 g

Pour wet mixture over dry, folding to incorporate. Batter will be very thick, and dense, with lumps. If your batter is so thick it resembles paste, add up to 1/4 cup milk, or as necessary, to thin it out. Carefully turn batter out into pan, right on top of the melted butter. Smooth batter lightly with a spatula and push it into the corners. If some of the butter sloshes up and covers the batter, it's okay. With a knife, score the batter into 9 pieces (3 horizontal slices, 3 vertical slices); be careful not to slice too deeply and rip the foil. Scoring the batter makes post-baking slicing easier. Bake for about 22 to 24 minutes, or until bread is set, domed, golden, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow bread to cool in pan for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving. If any butter pooled in bottom of pan, drizzle it over the top.

Serve with sorbet.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cookie                                                                                                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/n/nuts.html\">Nuts</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/s/sugar-cookie-recipes.html\">Cookie</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Cooking Style</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/e/easy.html\">Easy</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/almond-tuiles-732632", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 100, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Epicurious", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/steamed-clams-with-spicy-italian-sausage-and-fennel-153248.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 153248, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Steamed Clams with Spicy Italian Sausage and Fennel", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Epicurious", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 8-ounce bottle clam juice", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "clam juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/clam-juice.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 14187, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 pound spicy Italian sausages, casings removed, sausages coarsely crumbled", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "elk sausages", "metaInformation": ["italian", "crumbled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-chicken.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10017338, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 large fennel bulb with fronds, bulb cored, sliced;

Let rest for 1 hour, or until loaves have risen about 1 over the top of loaf pan.Preheat oven to 425F and bake for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 400F and continue baking for another 15 minutes.Let loaves cool for 20 minutes in the pans and then turn loaves out onto cooling rack until fully cooled.  (Tip: This bread freezes well.  Just wrap loaves tightly in plastic wrap once cooled and freeze until needed.)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/honey-oat-wheat-bread-625677", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,

Generously salt and pepper them. With a knife, score the back side along the bone (this allows the meat to absorb more of the cooking liquid).In a large stockpot, heat 2 tbsp olive or grapeseed oil over medium high heat. Add shortribs and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes on each side. While the meat is browning, place dried mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with 3 cups of hot water. Allow to soak for 20 minutes. Once the meat has finished browning, remove and set aside. Add roughly half of the white mushrooms to the stockpot and brown over medium high heat. Remove and set aside.Add remaining half of white mushrooms to the pan and brown, adding additional oil as needed. Add carrots, celery, onion and the rest of the browned mushrooms. Cook until onions are translucent. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, then reduce the heat to medium.By now the dried mushrooms will have softened. Drain the mushroom soaking water by straining it through a coffee filter or multiple layers of cheesecloth (use a mesh strainer or colander to hold the filter or cheesecloth) directly into the stockpot. Stir, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan as the liquid heats up.Give the soaked, softened mushrooms another quick rinse under running water to remove any remaining residue (wash carefully, grit can be hiding in the gills of the mushrooms). Chop the mushrooms into small pieces and add them to the stock pot.Add the chicken, beef or mushroom stock, barley, bay leaves and seared short ribs to the stockpot. Stir to combine all ingredients. Reduce heat to a low simmer. Allow soup to cook, uncovered, for 2 hours or until the barley and short ribs are completely tender and the soup is nicely thickened. Add water during the simmer if the soup becomes overly thick. After cooking, season with salt and pepper to taste. I use about 1 1/2 tsp salt and a heaping 1/4 tsp pepper. Use whatever amount of seasoning tastes best for you.Remove all of the short ribs from the soup and shred, then mix the meat back into the soup before serving.

Discard remaining flesh or save for another use.In medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until transparent, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Add reserved squash and cook until slightly softened, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add TVP flakes and cook, stirring, until coated with oil. Stir in thyme and cinnamon. Add tomato and cook until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, saffron mixture if desired, 1/4 cup water, currants, parsley, and 1 tablespoon soy cheese. The filling will be moist. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Place squash halves in square baking dish or ovenproof serving dish just large enough to hold them. Pour 1/2 cup water into dish. Spoon filling into each squash half, mounding slightly. In cup, mix bread crumbs with remaining soy cheese.

Scrape the onion into a large mixing bowl.3. Return the pan to medium heat and add 2 Tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Add the apples and celery. Saut\u00e9 until softened, 5-7 minutes.

Add the butter and pulse until it resembles coarse sand with some pea-size pieces of butter, about 20 pulses. Add the cream cheese and sour cream and pulse until it comes together in a rough dough, with some uneven pebble-size pieces. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into four equal portions. Pat each portion into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for 15 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, chop the hazelnuts in a clean food processor. Add the preserves, raisins and salt and puree to make a very smooth paste.Roll a portion of dough into a 6- by 14-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. (Don't worry about slightly rough edges; these will be rolled inside of the rugelach.) Spread one-quarter of the filling over the surface with a small spatula. Starting with a long side, roll the dough up into a tight cylinder, ending with the seam on the bottom. Press the top slightly to flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for another 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (The cylinders can be frozen for up to a month.)Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and evenly position the racks. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.Slice the cylinders into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place seam-side down on the prepared sheets. Whisk the egg yolks together and brush over the tops. Sprinkle with sugar and bake until pale golden and crispy on top, about 25 minutes.Remove from the oven and let cool slightly on the baking sheets. Carefully transfer the rugelach to a rack to cool. Store in a tightly sealed container for up to 3 days.

Season with salt, and then stir in the basil. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool the sauce and store for a make-ahead meal.Reheat over medium heat and stir in the milk, cooking until well incorporated.Heat a large pot of salted water to boil, and then cook the pappardelle to al dente. Reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water just before draining the pasta.Return the pasta to the drained pot and toss with half of the sauce and some starchy water. Serve the pasta in shallow bowls topped with extra sauce and some grated Pecorino-Romano.
