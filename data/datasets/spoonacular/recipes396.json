Heat a large Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Pour in enough oil to fill the pan about 1/4-inch deep. Season the beef generously with salt and pepper, and add to the pan. Saute half the meat, uncovered, stirring only occasionally, until well-browned, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate. Repeat with the remaining beef.

Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute more. Add the reserved beef and scatter the flour over the vegetable and beef mixture (enough to lightly coat) and cook stirring until lightly toasted. Add the water or broth, and bring to a simmer. Tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaves together with a piece of kitchen twine and add the bundle to the pot. Season with 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook the meat until just tender, about 1 1/2 hours. (This can also be done on the stove at a low simmer.)Remove pot from the oven. Skim the fat from the cooking liquid with a spoon or ladle. Add the potatoes, carrots, celery, and the tomatoes, and bring to a simmer on top of the stove. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens and the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Remove and discard the herb bundle. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide among bowls and serve immediately.Copyright 2003 Television Food Network, G.P.

garlic and shallots over a gentle heat until translucent. (If you have any trimmings of meat, you would add them at this time). Deglaze the pan with the wine, and add the beef stock and the thyme and rosemary. Allow this mixture to reduce. It could take 20 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) at a rolling boil, uncovered. You want the liquid to evaporate to about 1/3 of what you started with (in order to intensify the flavor). Once you have reduced the liquid to the required volume, remove from the heat, strain through a chinois (a conical strainer) or some cheesecloth (so you can remove all the vegetables and herbs), return the sauce to the pan and stir in the butter to finish the sauce. Allow to rest in a warm place.For the potatoes:Boil the potatoes with the bay leaves until the potatoes are tender.

Taste for salt. Set aside.Bring 1/4 to 1/2 an inch of water to a boil in a covered medium saucepan over medium heat.Place the florets in a steamer basket, set in the saucepan, cover, and steam until the cauliflower is tender, 8 to 10 minutes.While the cauliflower steams, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a Lodge 15-inch cast iron skillet over medium-heat for about 1 minute.Add the lamb chops (you may need to cook them in batches), and cook 2 to 5 minutes per side, depending on their thickness and your desired degree of doneness (2 to 3 minutes per side for rare and 5 minutes plus for medium to medium-well).Remove to a plate, cover with aluminum foil, and let stand while you finish the cauliflower.Remove the steamer basket from the saucepan, and discard the steaming water.Melt the butter in the pan and add the florets.Mash as you would for mashed potatoes. (For smoother consistency, do this in a blender or food processor.)Add the cream and heat through over low heat, 2 to 3 minutes.Season with salt and pepper to taste.To serve, spoon cauliflower mash in the center of each plate, surrounded with 3 lamb chops and a little of the sauce over each chop.Find more lamb chop recipes on Food Republic:Marinated Lamb Chops RecipeLamb Chops With Spinach Tomato CouscousTandoori Lamb Chops Recipe", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lamb-chops-with-garlic-mint-sauce-and-cauliflower-mash-493976", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Lemon-Poppyseed-Pie-203207.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 203207, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Lemon Poppyseed Pie", "pricePerServing": 70.82, "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 lemons", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemons", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9150, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons poppy seeds", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "poppy seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/poppyseed.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2033, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups white sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white sugar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 29.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/05/lemon-curd-poppyseed-pie-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "1", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}], "step": "For the Crust: Using a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixer.", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "id": 9156, "name": "lemon zest"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 20081, "name": "all purpose flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "id": 19335, "name": "sugar"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Add egg and pulse until dough easily forms a ball.
