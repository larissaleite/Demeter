Heat the olive oil in a large, straight-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the oats and toast, stirring often, until they smell nutty, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Add 2 1/4 cups of the chicken stock and 2 1/4 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until the oatmeal has absorbed most of the liquid. Add more of the chicken stock or water as needed and continue to cook until the oatmeal is tender, about 25 minutes total.Stir in the butter along with half of the basil, mint and cheese. Divide the oatmeal among serving bowls and top each with some of the remaining basil, mint and cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.

Spoon the mixture into cases and bake at 325f/160c/140c fan/gas 3 for about 16 minutes. Do the skewer test with these too.I have given the time for one batch of cupcakes using the cupcake maker.1.

Put the brisket in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover the meat by an inch. Add the onion quarters and 1/4 cup salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer partially covered until the brisket is very tender, 2 1/2 hours. Add more water if needed to keep the meat covered. Turn off the heat and let the brisket cool in the cooking liquid to room temperature. Drain the brisket, discard the water and cool completely.Meanwhile, prepare the vinaigrette by whisking the olive oil and vinegar in a medium bowl until well combined. Add the lime juice, red onion and oregano and whisk again. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper.Shred the brisket into a large bowl. Add the cucumbers, tomatoes, capers, cilantro and radishes and toss to combine. Add the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.To make the grilled tostadas: Heat a grill pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Place a corn tortilla onto the hot pan until the tortilla is crisp with a slight char. Cook for about 5 minutes each side. Scoop the shredded beef salad onto the grilled tostada and garnish with some avocado slices.

Using tongs, gently add half of the short ribs to the hot oil (you do this in 2 batches because if the pan is overcrowded, the short ribs will steam instead of getting the nice brown crust that you want!). Sear on all 4 sides until  a nice deep brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and repeat process with second half of short ribs. While the short ribs are browning, add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to a food processor or blender and pulse into a coarse paste (You can do this step ahead if you want). Drain all of the oil & rendered fat from the pan (BE CAREFUL! The oil is PIPING HOT!). Add an additional 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil, and reduce heat to medium-high. Add the pureed veggies and cook, stirring occasionally for 10-12 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the red wine and stir until everything is well combined, scraped the bottom of the pan to get all the browned (yummy) bits off into the sauce! Using the tongs, carefully nestle the short ribs back into the sauce (Note: be sure they are all covered by the sauce as much as possible). Add the thyme bundles and bay leaves and top with 2 cups of water (until short ribs are just barely covered).Put lid on dutch oven and bake in preheated oven for 3 1/2 hours, turning the ribs 2 hours into cooking, and add additional water if needed (you want the ribs to remain mostly covered in braising liquid).Note: Add carrots during last hour of cooking if desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

                                                        Roast the potatoes by placing them in a 400 F oven until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Let cool, then scoop out the roasted potato flesh. Discard skins.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            To make the filling: In a medium sized mixing bowl, break up the potato slightly with a fork. Add farmer's cheese, cheddar cheese, soy sauce, sesame oil, fermented bean paste, cilantro, black pepper, and sichuan peppercorns and toss to combine, taking care not to break down the potatoes too much. There should still be discernible chunks of potatoes in the mixture. Season to taste with salt. Filling for wontons may be stored in a sealed refrigerated container for up to two days.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Place a 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of a wonton wrapper and moisten the edges with water. Fold one corner towards the opposite corner, creating a triangular pouch. Seal, taking care to push out as much air as possible. Once sealed, bring the two corners of the long end of the triangle together to form a rounded pouch. Transfer the wonton to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat until all the filling is used, making sure not to let wontons touch.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Bring a large pot of water to boil and add 1/4 of the wontons. Cook until they just begin to float, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or wire mesh spider and transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Separate the wontons so they don't touch. Repeat with remaining three batches.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many wontons as you can fit in a single layer and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until golden brown and crisp on the bottom. Transfer the wontons to a sering plate with the crisp side up.

                 For the chicken: In the bowl of a small food processor add the olive oil, tomato-vegetable juice, fennel seeds, oregano, salt, onion powder, paprika and garlic. Puree until it forms a rough paste. Place the chicken pieces in a plastic resealable bag. Add the paste to the bag and rub the marinade all over the chicken pieces. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place one rack in the middle of the oven and another in the top third of the oven.Remove the chicken from the bag and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 30 minutes.For the salad: In a large bowl, toss the bread with the olive oil and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Scatter the bread cubes around the chicken pieces. Place the tray back in the oven, this time on the top third, until the bread is toasted and the chicken is golden brown and an internal thermometer placed in the meat reads 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes.Rest the chicken for 10 minutes and reserve all of the juices in the tray.In the same large bowl add the tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, fennel, the toasted bread cubes, the remaining 1 cup cheese and all of the juices from the chicken tray. Add a bit of olive oil if needed, depending on the amount of juice from the chicken. Toss well with a large spoon. Serve the bread salad with the roasted chicken.

Careful not to let the chili toast too much or burn.Take the toasted chile peppers out of the skillet, leaving the loose seeds behind to discard.Combine the toasted peppers and 1 tsp salt, then make the toasted chiles into powder. You can use a mortar and pestle to grind the chiles and salt to a powder-- this will take 10 minutes or so and a lot of elbow grease. Or, you can grind the peppers and salt together in a spice grinder. Either way, be careful not to inhale the powder-- it's really spicy and will make your nose burn! Also don't touch your eyes while working with the chiles and chile powder.In a salad bowl, toss the cubed fruit with fresh lemon juice and 1/2 tsp salt. Add additional salt or lemon juice to taste, if desired.Serve fruit salad alongside the toasted chile powder. Guests can sprinkle the chile powder onto their individual salad serving to taste. Younger and spice-sensitive guests may prefer the salad without the spicy powder, and people like varying degrees of spiciness, which is why the chile powder is traditionally served on the side. You may have some chili powder left over, which you can use for future fruit salads, or to sprinkle on chicken or fish-- anywhere you need a salty, spicy kick! Also, Sandra recommends drinking the juice at the bottom of the fruit salad bowl because it is delicious. :)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/ensalada-de-frutas-con-chile-spicy-mexican-fruit-salad-471719", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/grilled-fruit-skewers-with-chili-and-lime-744067.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 744067, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Grilled Fruit Skewers with Chili and Lime", "preparationMinutes": 50, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 teaspoons chili powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2009, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "Coarse sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "coarse sea salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Grated zest and juice of 1 lime", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lime", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9160, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 mangoes, peeled, pitted and cut into 1-inch cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mangoes", "metaInformation": ["pitted", "peeled", "cut into 1-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mango.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9176, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "pineapple", "metaInformation": ["cored", "peeled", "cut into 1-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9266, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Vegetable oil, for brushing", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": ["for brushing"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 5 -to-6-pound seedless watermelon, cut into 1-inch cubes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "watermelon", "metaInformation": ["seedless", "cut into 1-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/watermelon.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.5, "id": 9326, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 66.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/grilled-fruit-skewers-with-chili-and-lime.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 164, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Soak 18 wooden skewers in water 20 minutes.
