Gently fold this mixture into the remaining egg whites just until smooth. Fold in the flour.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Using an offset spatula, spread one-quarter  of the batter in each prepared baking pan. Transfer to the oven and bake until the cake is very light brown, about 8 minutes. Remove to racks to cool completely. Using a plate or pot lid as a guide, cut each cake into two 8-inch rounds.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Make the caramel cream: In a medium saucepan, heat the sugar and water over high heat until the sugar dissolves, then cook, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel is dark brown and starts to bubble and smoke, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly and carefully whisk in 1 1/3 cups of the cream. Pour the hot caramel into a heatproof bowl and let cool, then refrigerate overnight.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 2 cups of cream with the cold caramel until the cream holds a medium peak.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with a round of parchment paper; line the sides with a long strip of parchment. Set one of the cake rounds in the prepared pan. Using an offset spatula, spread about 3/4 cup of the caramel cream on top. Set another round on top and continue layering with the remaining caramel cream and 5 of the cake rounds, finishing with a layer of cream. Refrigerate the cake until set, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or freeze for about 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Make the caramel crown: Set the remaining cake round on a sheet of parchment paper. In a small saucepan, heat the sugar and water over high heat until the sugar dissolves, then cook, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter. Pour over the cake and spread evenly.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Working quickly, spray a 10- to 12-inch chef\u2019s knife with cooking spray, and cut the caramel disk into 12 wedges; spray the knife again each time you make a cut. Let cool completely.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Remove the sides of the cake pan and discard the parchment. Transfer the cake to a cake plate.

This can be done way in advance.For the dough: In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want.In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour.For the pizza topping: Coat a large saute pan with oil, add the sausage and bring to medium heat. Cook the sausage until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.While the sausage cooks, mix together in a medium bowl the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and oregano.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a grill.When the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you're not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes).Brush the grill with oil and arrange each piece of dough on the grill; you might need to work in batches here. Grill until the dough is stiff and crisp and has lovely grill marks on it, then flip and repeat on the second side, moving occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn.Put the pizzas on baking sheets, smear each with some of the ricotta mixture, top with sausage and put as many pizzas as will comfortably fit in the oven; bake until the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Again, you may have to work in batches. Remove the pizzas from the oven, top with arugula and drizzle with the deliciously spicy chili oil!

Add the garlic, Fresno peppers, basil, guanciale and parsley and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Using an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth and finish with the butter.For the seasoned breadcrumbs: Combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, olive oil, parsley, garlic and oregano in a shallow baking dish.For the eggplant: Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a shallow baking dish. Whisk the eggs with 1/2 cup of water in a second shallow baking dish. Dredge each eggplant slice in the seasoned flour. Shake off any excess flour and place each slice into the egg wash. Once fully coated in the egg wash, dip the slices into the seasoned breadcrumbs. Repeat this process until all the eggplant slices are finished and fully coated.Cook the coated eggplant slices in the deep fryer in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and pat dry. Line a 9- by 5-inch baking dish with 1 cup of the marinara. Arrange a layer of fried eggplant slices on top of the marinara. Cover with another 1/2 cup of marinara, 1/4 cup of mozzarella and 1 tablespoon of Parmesan. Repeat this process 2 more times. Add 1 more layer of fried eggplant slices followed by 1/2 cup of marinara.Use parchment paper to gently press the eggplant down into the baking dish for a snug fit.

Let sit for about 15-20 minutes, until foamy. Meanwhile, microwave the butter and milk in a microwave-safe bowl for 40 seconds and stir together until the butter melts completely into the milk (microwave a bit longer if needed). Allow to cool to lukewarm.Add the cooled butter/milk mixture to the yeast mixture along with the egg. Mix together with a wooden spoon, breaking up the egg in the process. Add 4 cups of bread flour, remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt and fold in as best as possible until you have a shaggy dough mixture.
