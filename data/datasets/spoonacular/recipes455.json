Into a large bowl, sift together the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and salt twice.2. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks, water, vegetable oil, lemon zest and vanilla on high speed until smooth. Stir into the flour mixture until smooth.3. In a third bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, beating on high speed until peaks are stiff but not dry.4. Use a rubber spatula and fold one-quarter of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, then fold in the remaining whites. Scrape the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom and spread evenly. Bake in a preheated 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) oven until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.5. Let cool upside down for at least 1 1/2 hours, setting the tube over a bottleneck or resting the pan on four glasses.6. To unmold, slide a thin knife around the cake to detach it from the pan, pressing the knife against the pan to avoid tearing the cake. Using the same procedure, detach the cake from the center tube. Pull the tube upward to remove the cake from the pan side. Slide the knife under the cake to detach it from the bottom. Invert and allow the cake to drop onto your hand, a rack, or a serving platter. Invert again, right side up, on a rack to cool complete before icing.Make the icing7. Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler over low heat.

Butter eight 3/4-cup ramekins. Mix caramel sauce and 1/4 teaspoon sea salt in small bowl. Spoon 1 generous tablespoon caramel into each ramekin. Place bread on rimmed baking sheet. Spread 1 generous tablespoon caramel over each bread slice. Broil until caramel is bubbling and slightly darker, watching to avoid burning, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool.                                                                Cut each bread slice into 6 squares, for 48 pieces total. Set 1 banana slice on each bread square. Arrange 6 banana-topped bread squares standing on edge, side by side in each prepared ramekin, fitting snugly. Whisk eggs, half and half, milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, vanilla, and 1/8 teaspoon sea salt in medium bowl. Pour enough custard into each ramekin to reach top. Let stand until bread absorbs some of custard, about 30 minutes. Reserve any remaining custard.                                                                Meanwhile, position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Pour remaining custard into ramekins. Brush exposed bread pieces with melted butter. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Set ramekins in large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake puddings until set and knife inserted into custard comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
