Place another large skillet over medium-low heat and add in the olive oil. Very carefully, over the skillet, turn one ramekin over and tap the bottom with one hand until the noodles come out. Repeat for the other ramekin.Cook (without moving) the noodle buns for about 3-4 minutes and then flip over and cook an additional 2-3 minutes or until all noodles are compact. There will be a slight char on both sides.Place each noodle bun on a separate plate and smear with the other tbsp of spiced ketchup. Top with the sloppy joe mixture.
