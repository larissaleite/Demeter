My cake at one point did start to ooze through on the corner, so you might want to leave a thin baking sheet below the cake pan just to ensure no spillage.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Gently pat the crumbs into the batter with the palm of your hand; but do not press hard.                                                                                                                             13                                                                            Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown on top and begins to come away form the sides of the pan.                                                                                                                            14                                                                            Note: You may notice that the cake feels fairly heavy.
