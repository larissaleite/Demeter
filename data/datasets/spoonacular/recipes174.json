with enough boiling water to cover them by 2 inches.  Allow to sit for 30 minutes.  Note: Preparation of other ingredients can be done while the black-eyed peas are soaking. Preheat oven to lowest setting at this time (135 degrees or whatever your oven lowest setting is).After the black-eyed peas have soaked for 30 minutes, assemble a second bowl with warm water (will be to dip your hands to remove the skins) and a bowl for the skinned black-eyed peas.  To skin the Black-Eyed Peas: Pinch the black-eyed pea at the \u2018black eye\u2019 and pull off the skin.  The skins are not visible at first but after starting you will be able to see them.  The pea\u2019s \u2018black eye\u2019 is part of the skin so once the skin is off the black eye is also removed.  The skins stick to the fingers so once you have pinched the skin off, rinse your fingers in the bowl of water to free the skin from your hand and place the skinned black-eyed pea in the third bowl.  Repeat until all peas have been skinned.Using a blender, combine the onion, garlic, tomato, chilies, ginger, tomato paste, cayenne pepper and salt and process at high speed to blend into a puree.In an 8 inch or 10 inch heavy skillet heat the vegetable oil over moderate heat.  When heated add the puree mixture, stirring constantly, and cook briskly until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape on a spoon (3-5 minutes).

To skin the Black-Eyed Peas: Pinch the black-eyed pea at the \u2018black eye\u2019 and pull off the skin.  The skins are not visible at first but after starting you will be able to see them.  The pea\u2019s \u2018black eye\u2019 is part of the skin so once the skin is off the black eye is also removed.  The skins stick to the fingers so once you have pinched the skin off, rinse your fingers in the bowl of water to free the skin from your hand and place the skinned black-eyed pea in the third bowl.
