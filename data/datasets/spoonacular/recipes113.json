To Make the Herb Oil: Warm 2 cups of olive oil to about 100 degrees F. Add 1 cup of chopped fresh herbs or 1/3 cup dried herbs. Add the salt, pepper, and garlic. Stir together and allow to steep while you prepare the dough. You can keep any leftover herb oil in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks (it makes a fabulous dipping oil!).2. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add the oil and water and mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until all the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball. Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.3. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter to make a bed about 6 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dippedi n water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and dust liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Wait 5 minutes for the dough to relax.4. Coat your hands with flour and stretch the dough from each end to twice its size. Fold it, letter style, over itself to return it to a rectangular shape. Mist the top  of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap.5. Let rest for 30 minutes. Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. After 30 minutes, repeat this one more time.6. Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1 hour. It should swell but not necessarily double in size.7. Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment and drizzle \u00bc olive oil over the paper, and spread it with y our hands or a brush to cover the surface. Lightly oil your hands and, using a plastic or metal pastry scraper, lift the dough off teh counter and transfer it to the sheet pan, maintaining the rectangular shape as much as possible.8. Spoon half of the herb oil over the dough. Use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it to fill the pan simultaneously. Do not use the flat of your hands - only the fingertips - to avoid tearing or ripping the dough. Try to keep the thickness as uniform as possible across the surface. Dimpling allows you to degas only part of the dough while preserving gas in the non-dimpled sections. If the dough becomes too springy, let it rest for about 15 minutes and then continue dimpling. Don't worry if you are unable to fill the pan 100 perfect, especially the corners. As the dough relaxes and proofs, it will spread out naturally. Use more herb oil as needed to ensure that the entire surface is coated with oil.9. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough overnight (or for up to 3 days).10.Remove the pan from the refrigerator 3 hours before baking. Drizzle additional herb oil over the surface and dimple it in. This should allow you to fill the pan completely with the dough to a thickness of about \u00bd-inch. Cover the pan with plastic and proof the dough at room temperature for 3 hours, or until the dough doubles in size, rising to a thickness of nearly 1 inch.11. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.12. Place the pan in the oven. Lower the oven setting to 450 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking the focaccia for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it begins to turn a light golden brown.

Layer a piece of cheese next, then more ham, then more cheese.  Place the tops of the rolls onto the sliders.  Drizzle a teaspoon of the buttery mixture over the top of each roll.  If you have some of this mixture left over, you can make a few more sliders.  Otherwise, drizzle the rest of the mixture over the tops of the sliders.4.  If baking now, place in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes- until the sliders are warmed, the cheese is melted and the tops of the rolls are lightly browned.

set aside.Spread the crabmeat on a cookie sheet and carefully remove any bits of shell. Transfer to a large bowl and toss gently with the bread. Spoon the wet mix over the crabmeat and gently fold until just combined. Allow themixture to rest in refrigerator for 10 minutes.Shape the mixture into 12 even-sized cakes (approximately 4 ounces each). Chill the crab cakes for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight to firm up.Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry the crab cakes, turning once, until golden brown and heated through. (Alternatively, bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes.)Serve immediately.

Remove the package of giblets and set it aside for another use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot it dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Remove the skin from the chicken, if desired. You can pull most of it off with your fingers; use a paring knife to cut the skin away from the wings and ends of the drumsticks. Make two deep slashes to the bone in both sides of the chicken breast and in each leg and thigh so that the spices and heat will penetrate the meat more easily.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Place the garlic, ginger, salt, paprika, turmeric, coriander, cumin, and pepper in a mortar and pound them to a smooth paste with a pestle, then work in the oil. If you don\u2019t have a mortar and pestle, you can make the spice paste in a food processor (a mini processor works better than a full-size processor, but you can use a full-size processor if you scrape down the side of the bowl often with a rubber spatula). Run the processor until the garlic and ginger are finely chopped, then gradually add the oil and puree to a smooth paste.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the tandoori paste into the neck and body cavities of the bird, spreading it around with the spatula. Place the bird in a baking dish or aluminum foil pan just large enough to hold it. Spread the remaining spice paste over the chicken on all sides. (Alternatively, you can marinate the bird in a large, heavy-duty, resealable plastic bag.) Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 6 hours or as long as 24; the longer it marinates, the richer the flavor will be.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Set up the grill for indirect grilling, place a drip pan in the center, and preheat the grill to medium.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            If you are cooking the chicken on a can, pop the tab off the can and drink half of the club soda or beer (or pour it out). Using a church key\u2013style can opener, make 2 additional holes in the top. If you are using a beer-can chicken roaster, pour half of the club soda or beer into it. Remove the chicken from the marinade, setting aside any remaining marinade. Hold the chicken upright, with the opening of the body cavity at the bottom, and position the bird on the can or chicken roaster so that it fits snugly into the cavity. If you are using a can, pull the legs forward to form a sort of tripod, so the bird stands upright. The rear \u201cleg\u201d of the tripod is the can. You don\u2019t need to do this if you are using a chicken roaster. Tuck the tips of the wings behind the chicken\u2019s back. Alternatively, truss the bird with butcher\u2019s string or a bamboo skewer.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            When ready to cook, place the chicken, on the can or roaster if using, in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. Spoon any remaining marinade over the chicken, then cover the grill. Grill the chicken until it is handsomely browned and cooked through, about 1 hour for a skinless bird, about 1 1/4 hours if the bird is skin-on. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170\u00b0F. If the top of the bird starts to brown too much, loosely cover it with a small piece of aluminum foil.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Carefully lift the chicken off the can or roaster, if using. Cut the chicken into pieces and serve with lemon wedges.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/uzbek-beer-can-chicken-207979", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes":

Tear the bread into chunks, or cut into cubes, and evenly distribute in the pan. Crack the eggs in a big bowl. Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla. Pour evenly over the bread. Cover the pan tightly and store in the fridge until needed (overnight preferably). Or you can make it and bake it right away---delicious no matter what!For the topping: Mix the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and some nutmeg in a separate bowl. Stir together using a fork. Add the butter and with a pastry cutter, and mix it all together until the mixture resembles fine pebbles. Store in a plastic bag in the fridge.When you're ready to bake the casserole, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the casserole from the fridge and sprinkle the topping over the top. Bake for 45 minutes for a softer, more bread pudding texture or for 1 hour-plus or more for a firmer, crisper texture.Scoop out individual portions. Top with butter and drizzle with warm pancake syrup and sprinkle with blueberries.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/baked-french-toast-428085", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic":

You might have to blend in a few batches. Transfer blended salsa to a medium pot over medium-low heat to keep warm.4) Prep filling ingredients by peeling peppers and slicing longwise into quarters, cutting corn off the cob, and grating cheese.5) Pour a few tablespoons of salsa into a large 9x13 baking dish. Put a small skillet over low heat and add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Once hot, add one corn tortilla and let cook in oil for five seconds per side just to warm it through.6) Using tongs, transfer tortilla to pot with hot tomatillo sauce. Coat tortilla lightly in sauce. Transfer tortilla to a clean surface.7) Add two pepper strips, some corn, and some grated cheese to the tortilla. Roll it up and pack it into the baking dish. Repeat until your baking dish is packed full of enchiladas.8) IF you have leftover corn, sprinkle it on top of your enchiladas along with any extra tomatillo sauce (you should have 2 cups or so of sauce left).

"instructions": "Directions                                                        Make the filling: Peel the ginger by scraping it with a spoon, then grate 1 tablespoon. Stem and finely chop the mushrooms. Combine the ginger, mushrooms, scallion, pork, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil and cornstarch in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well with your hands until all of the ingredients are incorporated.Form the dumplings: Place a damp paper towel over the wonton wrappers to keep them from drying out. Remove 1 wrapper and brush with some of the beaten egg.Make a circle with your thumb and index finger; lay the wrapper on top, nudging it down to create a cup. Add 2 teaspoons filling, then pat the filling down with the back of a spoon.Fold the overhanging wrapper edges down, leaving the filling exposed. Press the wrapper firmly around the filling. Pat the top and bottom of the dumpling to make it flat.Top the dumpling with a dried goji berry or 1 each frozen pea and carrot. Repeat to form the remaining dumplings.Steam the dumplings: Cut out a round of parchment paper to fit in a bamboo steamer and punch holes in the paper to let steam through. Line the steamer with the parchment and brush with vegetable oil; arrange the dumplings in the steamer and cover. Put the steamer in a wok or skillet with a few inches of boiling water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the steamer. Steam the dumplings 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.Make the sauce: Combine the chile paste and soy sauce in a small shallow bowl. Serve with the dumplings for dipping.Photograph by Eric Wolfinger                                                    Recipe courtesy of Ching-He Huang for Food Network Magazine

Whisk together all ingredients until well combined. Set aside.Make the omelet2. Whisk the eggs, half-and-half, sugar, soy sauce, and salt together in a bowl. Place a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Pour 1/2 teaspoon of the vegetable oil into the pan and coat evenly using a paper towel; discard the excess oil.3. Once the oil is hot, pour half the egg mixture into the pan in a thin layer and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes, then flip with a flat-bottomed spatula and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from the pan and set on a plate to cool. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture and oil to make the second omelet. Once cool, thinly slice the omelets. Refrigerate until ready to serve.Prepare the shrimp4. Butterfly the shrimp as follows: With a paring knife, make a cut along the underside of the shrimp, being careful not to cut through them entirely (the shrimp should lie flat but still remain in one piece). Press down lightly on the shrimp so they lie flat, then thread one shrimp onto each skewer.5. Add the salt to a large pot of water and bring to a simmer. While the water is simmering, prepare an ice bath. Add the shrimp to the simmering water and cook until they are cooked through, about 90 seconds (they turn pink and are no longer translucent). Transfer the shrimp to the ice bath. Once theyre cool, drain, pat dry, and season with a pinch of salt.Assemble the dish6. In a bowl, cover the wakame with the hot water and let sit for 10 minutes. Drain well and set aside.7. Prepare an ice bath and place a large pot of water over high heat to bring to boil. Add the noodles and cook following the package instructions. Remove the noodles from the water and submerge in the ice bath. Drain well.8. Divide the noodles among 4 plates and top each with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Place one-fourth each of the crabmeat, lettuce, tomatoes, ham, cucumber, carrots, shrimp, omelet, and wakame in small piles on the noodles to form a circle. Sprinkle the pickled ginger over the salad, then drizzle another 2 tablespoons of dressing over the top.

In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip egg whites with cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high and slowly add in sugar mixture (I just continuously added 1 heaping tbsp at a time one right after the other), then increase speed to high and whip until stiff glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes, adding in vanilla during last minute of mixing. Spoon and dollop meringue into 3 to 4-inch circles (depending on how large you want them) onto parchment paper lined baking sheets then use the back of the spoon to create slight dips in their centers. Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes, then leave in oven with door closed, turn off oven and allow to rest in oven 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.To assemble, top meringues with Cream Cheese Whipped Cream then Raspberry Sauce and garnish with mint. Assemble just before serving.For the raspberry sauce:In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1/3 cup water. Add half of the raspberries, then cook mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly until mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and cool completely. Stir in remaining raspberries. Store in refrigerator in an airtight container.

Set a strainer over a medium bowl; set aside. Stir lime juice, eggs, egg yolks, and sugar together in another medium bowl. Set bowl over a large saucepan of gently simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk until mixture has thickened, the whisk leaves a path when lifted from curd, and an instant-read thermometer registers 175\u00b0, about 15 minutes. Add butter to curd, one Tbsp. at a time, whisking to blend between additions. Strain curd into prepared bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Can be made 2 days ahead. Refrigerate curd.2. Sprinkle gelatin over 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl; let stand until gelatin is soft, about 10 minutes. Using an electric mixer, beat cream until soft peaks form. Add gelatin mixture; continue beating cream until just before firm peaks form. Fold whipped cream into lime curd. Cover; chill.Blackberry Compote3. Bring red wine, sugar, and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, 20-25 minutes. Let cool. Add 3 cups berries; fold gently to coat.4. Spread compote in an even layer over baked crust. Spoon lime curd over berries, smooth top, and chill for 1 hour.Meringue5. If toasting meringue in oven, preheat oven to 450\u00b0. Place egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat whites in mixer until soft peaks form. Set aside. Stir sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Attach a candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat to medium-high and boil without stirring, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush, until thermometer registers 238\u00b0, 6-8 minutes. Remove pan from heat.6. Meanwhile, beat whites in mixer until soft peaks form. Beat in salt.7. Slowly pour hot sugar syrup down side of bowl into whites and beat until meringue is firm and glossy.
