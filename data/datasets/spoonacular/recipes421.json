Place the balls of dough pinch-side down on the prepared baking sheet, spaced apart from each other. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rise for another 30-45 minutes, until puffy. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Prepare the dutch crunch topping by combining the yeast, warm water, sugar, vegetable oil, salt, and 3/4 cup rice flour in a medium bowl. Beat together well to form a smooth, thick \"batter\" that drips off your whisk in thick clumps. Add up to another 1/4 cup rice flour if needed to achieve the desired consistancy. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Spoon the topping in equal amounts over the fully risen rolls. As you do so, it will start rolling over the sides of the rolls. Once you've used it all up (it will seem like a lot, but use it all), scoop up any excess topping that has dripped onto the baking sheet and use it to cover any areas of the rolls left exposed. Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, until golden-brown on top.
