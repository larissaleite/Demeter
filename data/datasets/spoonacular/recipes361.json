Place a smaller pot lid over pears to keep submerged in liquids. Simmer for 25-30 minutes, turning pears every few minutes to ensure they cook evenly, until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork or blunt knife. Use a slotted spoon to remove from saucepan and transfer to a lidded container. Strain the remaining liquids through a fine-mesh sieve and transfer back to the saucepan. Stir in the remaining 3 1/2 ounces (1/2 cup) sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and boil until liquid has reduced to about 1/3-1/4 of the original amount. Remove from heat and stir in almond extract. Pour over pears in container and refrigerate, or, if serving immediately, transfer pears to serving glasses/bowls and pour some syrup into each.  Make whipped cream just before serving.Add the cream to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment (or other bowl if using a handheld electric mixer) and add vanilla bean seeds. Beat on medium-high speed until thickened. Reduce speed to low and add sugar and almond extract. Increase speed and continue to beat just until whipped cream can hold its shape. Dollop whipped cream into each serving glass/bowl and top with sliced almonds if desired.

Add garlic and olive oil and pulse again. Add cheese, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Pulse until just blended. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse a few more times. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator. Add more olive oil before serving, if taken straight from the fridge. Or freeze in ice cube trays so you can easily pop out a new serving with a fresh batch of pasta. This will make about 6-8 ice cube size servings (2 people/ea), so double the recipe if you would like more.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/fresh-pesto-508973", "dishTypes":
