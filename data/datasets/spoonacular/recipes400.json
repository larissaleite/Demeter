Set aside.Beat the egg yolks and whole eggs with an electric mixer on low speed about 1 minute to blend, add the sugar and beat another minute to blend the eggs and sugar. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat for 5 to 8 minutes or until the mixture is very thick and drops in ribbons when the beater is lifted. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture.Place the flour mixture into a wire mesh strainer and sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time over the egg mixture. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, fold the flour mixture into the eggs, using about 3 to 4 turns with each addition of flour, and making sure to reach to the bottom of the bowl as you fold. Do not worry about incorporating all the flour until the last addition, as too much handling will deflate the batter. The flour should be added quickly in about 4 to 5 additions.Before the last addition of flour, quickly pour the warm milk mixture in a stream over the batter. Immediately sprinkle in the remaining flour mixture, and fold into the batter taking about 12 to 15 more turns to completely incorporate the ingredients, and taking no more than 15 to 20 seconds as the batter can deflate quickly.Using a rubber spatula, immediately push the batter into the prepared pans. If any butter remains in the bottom of the bowl, do not add to the batter as this could prevent the cake from rising. Smooth the top of the batter with a small offset spatula or the back of a large spoon.Bake: Tap the pans on the counter to remove air bubbles, and place the pans in the oven. Bake 20 to 23 minutes or until the cake is golden brown, springy to the touch, and has come away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the oven and let stand 10 minutes on a wire cooling rack. Run a thin sharp knife around the edge of the pan to release the cake. Remove cake from the pan and place on a wire cooling rack to finish cooling. Tip: Lightly grease the cooling rack with vegetable oil or a nonstick cooking spray to prevent the cakes from sticking.In a small mixing bowl, combine cornstarch,  cup sugar, and salt; whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, then add the cornstarch mixture and whisk until thoroughly blended. Set aside.In a medium, non-reactive, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat, combine the milk, remaining  cup sugar, vanilla bean, and scraped vanilla bean seeds. (If using vanilla extract in place of the vanilla bean do not add to the milk; instead the vanilla extract will be added after the cream has been cooked.) Bring the milk mixture to a simmer, remove from the heat.Temper the eggs: Very slowly, in a thin stream, pour about  cup of the hot milk mixture into the beaten eggs while quickly whisking the two together with a wire whisk. Return the egg mixture back to the rest of the hot milk, pouring back slowly while quickly whisking the two mixtures together. Return to medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula in a figure eights pattern around the edge of the pan and into the center, making sure to scrape the rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until the mixture just comes to a boil. Continue to cook while stirring constantly for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Tip: A heat-resistant rubber spatula is best for stirring because it can scrape the entire bottom of the pot to help prevent the egg from clumping together and coagulating.Finishing the Pastry Cream: Remove and discard the vanilla bean if using. Or, if using vanilla extract, add it now. Also add the butter and stir until melted and completely blended. Let Pastry Cream cool to room temperature, stirring frequently while cooling. Or, Pour the Pastry Cream into a medium-sized bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface while the cream is cooling to prevent a skin from forming. The pastry cream will thicken as it cools.Place a sheet of plastic firm directly on the surface while the pastry cream is cooling to prevent a skin from forming. Cool to room temperature then refrigerate until completely chilled.Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Set aside.In a small heavy saucepan over medium low heat, heat the cream until it is hot and just beginning to steam. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate, stirring until the chocolate is completely melted. Add Lyles Golden Syrup and vanilla, stirring until completely mixed.Let the glaze sit about 10 minutes or until it registers 90 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Stir the glaze occasionally while cooling. The glaze should be like a soft icing, but thin enough that it will run down over the sides of the cake.While the chocolate glaze is cooling, place one of the layers on a cake plate. Using an spread the Pastry Cream evenly over the layer to the edge of the cake. Place the second cake layer on top.Pour the Chocolate Glaze onto the middle of the top layer and let the glaze flow over the top and allow the glaze to drip down the sides. Let the glaze set before serving.Cover cake loosely and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. The marmalade may take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or so to set. After about 10 minutes, start checking it frequently.2 There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars. One way is to check the thermometer for when the mixture reaches a temperature of 220-222\u00b0F (8-10\u00b0F above the boiling point at your altitude). Another way is to put a bit of it on a chilled plate and look for signs of it \"wrinkling up\" when you push it with your finger tip. Depending on how accurate your thermometer is, you might find the wrinkle test more reliable. Put several small plates into the freezer. As the jelly temperature exceeds 218\u00b0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn't ready. If it holds its shape a bit, that's a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.When you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. You may have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.I find the best jelly results from stopping the cooking as soon as the temp reaches 220\u00b0 (I use a very accurate digital thermometer). At this point the test jelly is just barely wrinkling.Overcooking a marmalade will result in a caramelized flavor or tough orange peels in your marmalade.1 There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\u00b0F oven for 10 minutes.2 As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot.", "number": 17, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange.jpg", "id": 9200, "name": "orange"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "id": 14412, "name": "water"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/paper-towels.jpg", "id": 405895, "name": "paper towels"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ladle.jpg", "id": 404630, "name": "ladle"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.3 Once the jelly has reached 220\u00b0F (or 8\u00b0F over the boiling temperature of water at your altitude) remove the jelly pot from the heat.

It's okay if there is still some pith. Use a sharp chef's knife to thinly julienne the peel. Once you julienne all of the oranges that you juiced to make 2 cups of juice, you should have about 4 cups of peel. Set these julienned peels aside.4 Juice the regular lemon and add this juice to the orange juice. Save the seeds for making pectin. Cut the Meyer lemon in eigths, lengthwise. Remove the seeds and as much of the inner membranes as you can easily remove. Cut the lemon segments crosswise into triangular pieces. (See the steps in the Meyer lemon marmalade recipe for photo descriptions.) Add the Meyer lemon seeds and membranes to the Seville orange seeds and membranes. 5 Put all of the citrus seeds and membranes into 4 layers of cheesecloth, tied up tightly with string, or into a muslin jelly bag.\u00a01 Place the orange and lemon juices into a large thick-bottomed pot, either 5 or 6-quart. Add the julienned orange peels and Meyer lemon pieces and the water.2 Place the cheesecloth or muslin bag containing the citrus seeds and pulp into the pot and secure the string at the other end to the pot handle. As the mixture cooks, the pectin from the seeds and membranes will be extracted into the mixture.3 Bring mixture to a boil. Let boil, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until the peels are soft and cooked through. Remove from heat.4 Remove the pectin bag and place it in a bowl to let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\u00a01 Pour out the mixture from the pot into a large measuring cup. Measure how much of the mixture you have. Depending on how hard of a boil and how long the cooking time, you could have anywhere from 4 to 5 cups. Return the mixture back to the pan.2 Add to the mixture 7/8 cup of sugar for every cup of mixture. So, if you measured 4 cups of mixture, add in 3 1/2 cups of sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, taste the mixture. Add more sugar depending on how sweet you want your marmalade to be. Note that the jelly mixture will reduce further, intensifying both the flavor and the sweetness of the jelly. I typically use 4 cups of sugar for every 4 cups of fruit mixture.Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, squeeze it like play-doh to extract extra pectin. Grasp a tangerine size portion of the bag and squeeze, pulling the bag away from you with one hand as you hold firmly with the other hand. Work your way around the bag. \"Milk\" the pectin until you have released anywhere from 2 Tbsp to 4 Tbsp of pectin. It should take a few minutes. The pectin has the consistency of sour cream. Add it to the orange mixture.1 Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. The marmalade may take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or so to set. After about 10 minutes, start checking it frequently.2 There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars. One way is to check the thermometer for when the mixture reaches a temperature of 220-222\u00b0F (8-10\u00b0F above the boiling point at your altitude). Another way is to put a bit of it on a chilled plate and look for signs of it \"wrinkling up\" when you push it with your finger tip. Depending on how accurate your thermometer is, you might find the wrinkle test more reliable. Put several small plates into the freezer. As the jelly temperature exceeds 218\u00b0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn't ready. If it holds its shape a bit, that's a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.When you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. You may have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.I find the best jelly results from stopping the cooking as soon as the temp reaches 220\u00b0 (I use a very accurate digital thermometer). At this point the test jelly is just barely wrinkling.Overcooking a marmalade will result in a caramelized flavor or tough orange peels in your marmalade.1 There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\u00b0F oven for 10 minutes.2 As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.3 Once the jelly has reached 220\u00b0F (or 8\u00b0F over the boiling temperature of water at your altitude) remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal. Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.If you want, you can process the jars in a hot water bath for 5 minutes to help get a better seal and to help prevent mold. If you used boiling water in an earlier step to sterilize the jars, you can just keep the same set-up for the water bath. You want to make sure there is a rack at the bottom of the pot so that the jars aren't actually resting on the bottom of the pot.4 Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\u00a0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/seville-orange-marmalade-246151", "dishTypes": ["condiment", "dip", "spread"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 5, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Kraft Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/miracle-whip-sweet-spicy-tuna-265557.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 265557, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "MIRACLE WHIP Sweet & Spicy Tuna", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 138.96, "creditText": "Kraft Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup English cucumber slices", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "english cucumber", "metaInformation": ["english"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg", "unitLong": "cupslices", "unitShort": "cupslices", "amount": 0.25, "id": 10111205, "unit": "cupslices"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp. thinly sliced green onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green onions", "metaInformation": ["green", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11291, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "2 pieces leaf lettuce", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11252, "unit": "pieces"}, {"originalString": "3 Tbsp.

I find this depends on the sweetness of the berries quite a bit, but I usually add a touch of stevia regardless as it seems to \u201cbrighten\u201d the overall flavor when used lightly.Pour the mixture into your popsicle molds, and freeze until solid \u2013 this usually takes about 2 hours.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/low-fat-blueberry-cream-popsicles-249266", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 5, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Strawberry---Pimms-jelly-218763.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 2, "id": 218763, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Strawberry & Pimm\u2019s jelly", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 191.49, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "50g caster sugar, plus extra to taste (optional)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "caster sugar", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 50.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "4 sheets leaf gelatine", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "gelatine", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/gelatin.png", "unitLong": "sheets", "unitShort": "sheets", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19177, "unit": "sheets"}, {"originalString": "750g ripe strawberries, plus extra to serve", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "strawberries", "metaInformation": ["ripe"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/strawberries.png", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 750.0, "id": 9316, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "whipped cream and shortbread, to serve", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whipped cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whipped-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1054, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 88.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2196662/strawberry-and-pimms-jelly", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/colander.jpg", "id": 404639, "name": "colander"}], "step": "Wash, drain and hull the strawberries.Tip into a food processor or blenderwith the caster sugar and blitz to crush.Line a colander with a sheet of cleanmuslin.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "id": 19335, "name": "caster sugar"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/strawberries.png", "id": 9316, "name": "strawberries"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/colander.jpg", "id": 404639, "name": "colander"}], "step": "Place the colander over a largebowl.
