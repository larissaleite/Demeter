Roast them either on the grill or in a baking dish in the oven for 25-30 minutes on the first side, or until the first side starts to get a char. Turn them and continue to cook them until the second side begins to blacken, another 15-25 minutes. (Depending on the heat of your grill, these temperatures may vary quite a bit.) Chances are, your peppers will be done before the onion and eggplant. If this is the case, remove them from the heat and place them on a plate. If using the oven, if after the vegetables are soft, they are not yet charred, turn on the broiler to give them a bit of color. (But watch them closely, the broiler works FAST!)Once the vegetables are soft and the skins are toasted, remove them from the heat and place them in a bowl. Cover them with a kitchen towel and set them aside to cool, 10-15 min.Once they are cool enough to handle, peel the skins off of the eggplant and peppers and remove the seeds. Tear or slice the vegetables into strips.Place the sliced vegetables into a serving bowl or platter. Add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and the salt. Finish with a splash of sherry vinegar, if desired.Serve with bread as an appetizer or as a side dish to meat or fish.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/escalivada-spanish-grilled-vegetables-paired-with-south-rhne-ros-winepw-729271", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Vegetarian Times", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/tropsicles-759507.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 759507, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Tropsicles", "pricePerServing": 55.35, "creditText": "Vegetarian Times", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bc to \u00bd cup agave nectar", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "agave nectar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19912, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 large banana, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "banana", "metaInformation": ["large", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9040, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup light coconut milk", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "light coconut milk", "metaInformation": ["light"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 99009, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups fresh pineapple chunks", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "pineapple chunks", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple-with-can.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1029354, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 41.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/tropsicles/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 0, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ladle.jpg", "id": 404630, "name": "ladle"}], "step": "Pur\u00e9e all ingredients in blender 1 to 2 minutes, or until mixture is smooth.

For the Beer Batter:                                        Mix the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add in the beer while whisking. Set aside and let the batter rest for 15 minutes before using.For Cream Sauce:Add the mayonnaise and crema to a medium bowl. Whisk in the lemon zest, lemon juice and water. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper (can be made 3 days ahead, covered and refrigerated).For the Fish:In a large skillet, over medium heat, add enough oil to reach a depth of 1-inch. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F or when the end of a wooden spoon sizzles when inserted into the oil.On a large plate, combine the flour and salt. Season the fish pieces all over with salt and pepper and coat with the flour. Working in batches, dip the fillets in the beer batter and coat on both sides. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Make tacos with the tortillas and fish and top each with cream, shredded cabbage, tomatillo salsa and pickled jalapenos, if desired.*Cook's Note: Crack open a cold Mexican cerveza like a Negra Modelo or a 2 Equis (XX) Amber to make this tasty beer batter, which will change the way you think about fried fish! You can use it for vegetables, too.**Cook's Note: Mexican Crema is Mexico's version of creme fraiche and is found at many supermarkets and can easily be substituted with sour cream.

Stir in the flour, and then stir in the mini chocolate chips. (A firm rubber spatula works best.) Grease a non-stick mini muffin pan with cooking spray or butter and then spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of brownie batter into the greased cups. Bake the brownie bites for about 12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.Cool the brownie bites in the pan for 10 minutes and then transfer them to a rack to cool completely while you make the coconut topping.Make the frosting:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the egg yolks, sugar and salt. Beat until combined.Beat in the butter, then gradually beat in the heavy cream and vanilla extract, scraping down sides as necessary.Pour the mixture into a medium non-stick saucepan. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes or just until the mixture thickens and begins to fluff. (There will be a noticeable change in the thickness of the mixture. Do not undercook it or the topping will be too runny.)Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and let cool until it is room temperature then stir in the chopped toasted pecans and flaked coconut.Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the topping onto each of the brownie bites. Serve immediately or store in an air-tight container at room temperature.Kelly's Note:Any leftover frosting can be served atop ice cream for German chocolate sundaes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
