See photos below.Stuff each piece of chicken with  oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third. Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a  tsp of water helps break it up).One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and youll end up with some really greasy chicken!.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "id": 5062, "name": "chicken breast"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg", "id": 2047, "name": "salt and pepper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "id": 4513, "name": "vegetable oil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg", "id": 18079, "name": "breadcrumbs"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepperoni.png", "id": 7057, "name": "pepperoni"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 20081, "name": "all purpose flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "id": 1123, "name": "egg"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side.

Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in. See photos below.Stuff each piece of chicken with  oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third. Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a  tsp of water helps break it up).One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and youll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces).

Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf from the soup.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Put the slices of bread on a baking sheet and top evenly with grated cheese. Broil until the cheese is bubbly, just a minute or two, and serve with the hot soup.

raisins. Ever since I baked those happy, sunny carrot muffins I've been pondering carrot bread. I wanted to create a new gluten-free bread recipe that featured several whole grains, including (gasp!) brown rice flour. Shocking, I know. Long time readers will confirm I'm not the biggest fan of rice flours. I almost never bake with them. And yet. There I was. Standing in the Whole Foods check out line. Buying a bag of Bob's Red Mill organic brown rice flour. On impulse. Because it just sounded good to me.Wholesome. Nutty. And friendly to carrots.Which is important in a gluten-free recipe. The friendliness. You want all your ingredients to get along. You want your flavors co-mingling in savory-sweet bliss. Supporting one another's strengths. Forgiving each other's weaknesses. No single gluten-free flour is perfect on its own, as you well know. Going solo doesn't work. It needs a supporting cast. It needs to find balance and achieve harmony via relationships. Give and take. That's what it's all about in the crazy game of gluten-free baking.Kinda like love.Carrot Bread Recipe with Raisins and Chai Spices", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg", "id": 20090, "name": "brown rice flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "id": 11124, "name": "carrot"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raisins.jpg", "id": 9299, "name": "raisins"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg", "id": 404770, "name": "baking paper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/loaf-pan.png", "id": 404715, "name": "loaf pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "By Karina Allrich January 2012This carrot bread recipe is flexible.

Ever since I baked those happy, sunny carrot muffins I've been pondering carrot bread. I wanted to create a new gluten-free bread recipe that featured several whole grains, including (gasp!) brown rice flour. Shocking, I know. Long time readers will confirm I'm not the biggest fan of rice flours. I almost never bake with them. And yet. There I was. Standing in the Whole Foods check out line. Buying a bag of Bob's Red Mill organic brown rice flour. On impulse. Because it just sounded good to me.Wholesome. Nutty. And friendly to carrots.Which is important in a gluten-free recipe. The friendliness. You want all your ingredients to get along. You want your flavors co-mingling in savory-sweet bliss. Supporting one another's strengths. Forgiving each other's weaknesses. No single gluten-free flour is perfect on its own, as you well know. Going solo doesn't work. It needs a supporting cast. It needs to find balance and achieve harmony via relationships. Give and take. That's what it's all about in the crazy game of gluten-free baking.Kinda like love.Carrot Bread Recipe with Raisins and Chai SpicesBy Karina Allrich January 2012This carrot bread recipe is flexible. If you don't care for raisins, try dried cranberries, or currants. If pecans aren't your favorite nut, leave them out- or use walnuts. If coconut milk isn't your thang, use almond or rice milk. Make it like you like it, Babycakes. (See notes below for more substitution ideas.)Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a 9-inch ceramic loaf pan with a piece of parchment paper that extends up over the top of the two long sides (this makes it easy to grip and lift the loaf out of the pan).Mix together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl:Ingredients:3/4 cup sorghum flour1/2 cup brown rice flour1/2 cup tapioca starch or potato starch (not potato flour)1/4 cup coconut flour or almond flour1/2 cup organic cane sugar1/2 cup organic light brown sugar1 tablespoon arrowroot starch2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon ground ginger1/2 teaspoon nutmeg1/8 teaspoon ground cloves2 large organic free-range eggs or Ener-G Egg Replacer (1/4 cup liquid, mixed)1/2 cup light olive oil or organic grapeseed oil1/2 cup coconut or non-dairy milk (more as needed, up to 3/4 cup)1 cup finely grated carrots (I use a box grater)1/2 cup raisins- dark or golden1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (may omit)Instructions:Whisk the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl- flours through spices.Add in the eggs or egg replacer, oil, and half cup coconut milk. As you beat the liquid ingredients into the dry mix, keep an eye on the batter. It should be smooth and slightly thick, close to a muffin batter. If it is too stiff or dry, add in more coconut milk as needed, a spoonful at a time to achieve a creamy-thick batter. I ended up using 3/4 cup total coconut milk, but you may need less liquid if you live in a more humid climate.Stir in the grated carrots, raisins and nuts by hand and mix to distribute. Scoop the batter into the parchment lined ceramic bread loaf pan and smooth out the top with a silicone spatula.Bake in the center of a pre-heated oven for one hour. (If you use a thinner metallic pan, you may have to adjust baking time as it may cook faster- especially around the edges.) The loaf should feel firm to the touch, and a wooden pick inserted into the center of the loaf should emerge clean.Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool.

Thank you.Recipe Notes:For readers who ask about substitutions for the coconut milk- you can use the non-dairy choice you prefer- from rice milk to orange juice. (Note: A plus for egg-free bakers, orange juice helps the loaf rise higher.)For flour subs:Use medium weight gluten-free flours to sub medium weight flours like sorghum (jowar) flour, and brown rice flour. Coconut flour is it's own kinda animal, but I'd guess almond flour might work if you don't care for coconut flour. Sub tapioca starch with other starches, such as cornstarch, potato starch or arrowroot starch.In place of raisins you might try dried cranberries.Leave the nuts out if you prefer.Wrap leftover slices in foil, bag and freeze to preserve \"just baked\" texture.For more tips see my Gluten-Free Baking Tips post and my Baking Substitutions Help page.More carrot centered gluten-free recipe
