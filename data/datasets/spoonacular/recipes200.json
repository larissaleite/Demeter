Remove it from the heat.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Start whipping the meringue on medium speed; then put on your oven mitts and slowly pour the hot syrup in a stream down the inside of the mixer bowl (careful, careful, careful: If you pour the syrup directly on the whisk, it will splatter). Once all the syrup is incorporated, increase the mixer speed to high and whip until the meringue gets very stiff and sticky, 3 to 5 minutes. When your mixer starts complaining, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Remove the bowl from the mixer and immediately and quickly stir in all the nuts and the vanilla seeds with the spatula. Pour the nougat onto the prepared baking sheet and either cover it with a layer of wafer paper or sift a generous amount of confectioners\u2019 sugar on top. If you need to spread it out into a more even layer, place a piece of parchment or a silicone mat on top of the wafer- or sugar-covered nougat and gently press down with flat hands until it\u2019s even. Allow the nougat to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Cover a cutting board with parchment or a generous dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Generously coat a sharp chef\u2019s knife and a paring knife with cooking spray. Run the paring knife around the edge of the nougat to loosen it, and then gently turn it out onto the cutting board. (If the nougat is being stubborn, oil the bench scraper and use it to help loosen it around the edges.) Using the chef\u2019s knife, trim the edges of the nougat and then slice it into bars or little bites.

container at cool room temperature for up to 2 weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/classic-european-nougat-205169", "dishTypes": ["antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer",
