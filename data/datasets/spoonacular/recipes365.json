Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture.                                                                                                                                                        Divide dough in half. Add red food coloring to one portion; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until easy to handle.                                                                                                                                                        Melt chocolate in microwave or heavy saucepan.  Stir 1 tablespoon of the remaining dough into chocolate until well mixed. Stir chocolate mixture into remaining plain dough. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until easy to handle.                                                                                                                                                        On a lightly floured surface, roll red dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut into 32 squares (1-1/4 in. each) and 12 circles (1-in. diameter); set aside.  (Return dough to refrigerator as needed.) Repeat with brown dough.                                                                                                                                                        On a parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet, alternate red and brown squares of eight squares. Gently press seams together. Place circles on baking sheets. Bake at 350 for 12 minutes or until set.                                                                                                                                                         Carefully slide parchment with checkerboard onto a wire rack to cool.                                                                                                                                                        For glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and enough water to achieve a thin glaze. Tint with food coloring. Dip 12 red cookies into red glaze; place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until set.                                                                                                                                                        Melt the chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave or heavy saucepan, stirring frequently. Dip 12 brown cookies into chocolate mixture; place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until set.

Mix well to combine.In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, almond milk, melted butter, lemon juice and vanilla extract.Pour the wet mixture over the dry oat mixture and stir to combine.Pour the muesli mixture into the prepared baking dish. Spread the mixture around so that the apples arent poking up too far and the mixture is evenly distributed.Bake in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until the top is golden brown and all of the liquid appears to be absorbed. Allow the breakfast bake to cool 15 minutes before slicing large portions and serving with coconut milk glaze on top (instructions below)! Add coconut milk and sugar to a small saucepan and bring it to a gentle boil.Reduce heat to medium and allow the coconut mixture to continue cooking, whisking frequently, until the coconut milk begins to thicken and turns a slightly darker shade. This process should take about 20 to 25 minutes.Remove coconut milk glaze from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. The longer it cools, the thicker the mixture will become.Serve the sauce on large hunks of Apple Cinnamon Baked Oatmeal!", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, turning the bag once or twice.Drain the wings, reserving the marinade. Bring the marinade to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by about half, about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill by placing coals on half of the grill. Light the charcoal and wait for the embers to become white. (Add your favorite wood or wood chips at this point.) Replace the grate and put the wings on the cooler side of the grill.Cover with the lid and cook until the juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes.Remove the wings from the grill and toss with the reduced marinade. Place the wings on the grill over direct heat and cook, turning frequently, until the sauce has caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Top with chopped scallions and serve with lime wedges.
