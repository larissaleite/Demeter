Stir in the chocolate chips and orange zest. Spread 1/4 of the cheese mixture into the bottom of an 8 by 8-inch baking dish.

"instructions": "Lightly grease six 3-1/2-Inch fluted mini tart or brioche molds and place them on a sheet pan for easier maneuvering. Set aside.In a small saucepan, vigorously whisk together the agar, \u201cmilk,\u201d and sugar until there are no lumps remaining. Set the pan over medium-low heat, and gently whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken. Take the pan off the stove to stir in both the \u201csour cream\u201d and coconut yogurt, mixing until smooth, and then return it to the heat very briefly. Cook the mixture just until bubbles begin to slowly break on the surface, whisking the whole time. Add in the rose water and vanilla, whisk to incorporate, and quickly transfer the contents of the saucepan to your prepared molds. Gently tap each one on the counter to knock out any air bubbles before smoothing out the tops with a spatula. Let cool completely at room temperature before thoroughly chilling.For the hibiscus sauce, plunk the tea bags into the water in a small saucepan. Place it on the stove over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat and cover, allowing the tea to steep for 20 to 30 minutes. Once deeply rose red in hue, remove the tea bags and allow the excess liquid to drip out, but do not squeeze them- This will cloud the mixture. Separately, stir together the sugar, orange zest, and cornstarch until thoroughly combined, and add these dry goods into the saucepan. Return it to the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid bubbling and fully thickened. Let cool before chilling in the fridge.To make the almond brittle, begin by combining the sugar, water, corn syrup, cinnamon, and salt in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Resist the urge to stir, and gently swirl the pan to mix the contents instead. Bring the mixture up to a boil, and continue to cool until the sugar caramelizes and turns a pale amber color. Meanwhile, set out a silpat or piece of parchment paper nearby where the brittle can come to rest. Once the sugar syrup has reached the right shade of golden brown, quickly stir in the sliced almonds to coat them evenly in the mixture, and waste no time in pouring everything onto your prepared silpat or parchment. Smooth out the brittle into as thin a layer as possible. Let cool completely before breaking it into pieces.To serve, spoon about 1/4 \u2013 1/3 cup of the hibiscus sauce onto the plate, and turn out one panna cotta on top. Wedge a piece of the almond brittle into the crest of the panna cotta, fan out three citrus surpremes alongside, and sprinkle pomegranate arils on top. Finish it all off with a few mint leaves to garnish.

saute pan and toast over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.Put the pork chunks through a sausage grinder into a bowl. Add the ground cumin and fennel and the chiles, sprinkle with salt and pepper and mix together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours to allow the flavors to meld.Divide the pork mixture into sixteen 3-inch patties, each about 3 ounces. Wrap each patty in caul fat.Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Sear half of the patties on both sides until golden brown and the sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining patties.For the kale pesto: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly golden brown and soft; transfer the garlic to a food processor.Increase the heat to high, add the kale and a splash of water to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is soft. Transfer the kale to the food processor and add the parsley, Parmesan, green onions, the remaining 1/4 cup oil and some salt and pepper and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.For the mash: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water by 2 inches and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 25 minutes.For the beer-mustard gravy: While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the beer and cook until completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, turn up the heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the honey and mustard and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.Preheat the broiler.To finish the mash, drain the potatoes well, return them to the pan and return the pan to the burner to dry them out for a minute. Run the potatoes through a food mill set over a large bowl. Add the warm cream and butter and mix until smooth. Fold in the mascarpone and season with salt and pepper. Add some of the kale pesto and marble in until swirled.To finish the bangers: Top each of the patties with some of the grated Cheddar and place under the broiler until melted and bubbly.Serve the bangers with the mash and beer-mustard gravy.

"instructions": "In a medium bowl combine the flour, yeast, and salt. Gradually add the water, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the water is incorporated and a shaggy dough forms. You may need to use your hands to fully incorporate the water. Just remember, you don't need to knead!Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a clean large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature in a draft-free place until the dough is doubled in size. This may take up to 10 hours, depending on how warm your kitchen is. Don't worry too much about the time as this dough is very forgiving. You can also let the dough ferment in the fridge overnight. Remove from the fridge 2 hours before using the dough, or until the dough is at room temperature. Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Divide into 3 equal portions. Take one portion of dough and gather 4 corners to the center to create 4 folds. Turn seam side down and roll into an even ball. Repeat with remaining portions. Let the dough rest, covered, until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough can be made ahead of time. Refrigerate the dough, individually wrapped in plastic, for up to 3 days. Unwrap and let rest at room temperature, covered in plastic wrap, for 2 to 3 hours before shaping. Freeze the dough, individually wrapped in plastic and placed in ziptop bags, for up to 1 month. Defrost the dough overnight in the fridge then allow to sit at room temperature as directed above before shaping.Place a baking stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 450F or 500F, as hot as you can comfortably crank it. The dough is now ready to be shaped. On a well-floured work surface use your hands and fingers to gently stretch one ball of dough out into an evenly thin 10 to 12-inch disk. To get the dough super thin, briefly stretch out with a rolling pin. Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined pizza peel or flat cookie sheet. Cover with a kitchen towel until ready to top. For the sauce:In a small saucepan combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce, and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.For the pepperoni:Place the pepperoni in a medium skillet. Set over medium-high heat and saute the pepperoni until some fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove the pepperoni to a paper towel-lined plate.To assemble:Brush the garlic butter onto the edges of the pizza dough. Top pizza dough with a large dollop of sauce and spread evenly. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Top with pepperoni and basil. Slide the dough onto the baking stone, keeping the parchment underneath the dough. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and the dough is golden brown.

Once the water is boiling, salt it with 1 Tbsp of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm).  Drain.2 Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce.  Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat.  Add the chopped onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.  Add the garlic, fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper.  Cook for an additional minute, until the garlic is fragrant.  Remove from heat and set aside. 3 Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat.  Salt the bottom of the pan generously.  Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef and add them to the pan, without stirring.  (You may need to work in batches; do not crowd the pan.)  You want the meat to get well browned.  If the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high.  On our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different.  Once the meat is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the meat over to brown on the other side.  At this point, assuming you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat.  The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat. 4 Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it to the pan with the seasoned onions.  Add tomato sauce.  Use the edge of your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller pieces.  Add basil.  Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes. 5 Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too acidic.  Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry.  Stir in the cooked penne pasta.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat, cover partially, and simmer over medium-low heat until the hominy has \u201cbloomed,\u201d or opened, 4 to 4 1/2 hours, skimming the foam from the surface and adding more water if needed. The hominy will be chewy. Remove from the heat and add 2 teaspoons salt.If using precooked hominy, dump the drained and rinsed hominy into a large pot and add 2 cups cold water.2. Place the chicken in a large pot and add enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Add the onion, cilantro, and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat, cover partially, and simmer over medium-low heat until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 40 minutes. Remove the chicken, straining and reserving the cooking liquid. Let the chicken cool.3. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-size pieces.4. Dump the shredded chicken and its cooking liquid into the pot with the hominy and place over medium heat until warmed through, about 10 minutes. The pozole should be soupy. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Remove the pot of pozole from the heat and set it aside while you make the chile pur\u00e9e. (You can let the pozole cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate it for up to 3 days.)Make the chile pur\u00e9e5. Place the ancho and guajillo chiles in a medium saucepan, add just enough water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer until softened and rehydrated, about 10 minutes.6. Place the chiles and 3/4 cup of their cooking liquid in a blender or food processor along with the onion, garlic, cumin, cloves, and salt and pur\u00e9e until smooth.

In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, oats, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger for 30 seconds, set aside.In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip together butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until creamy (occasionally stop and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl throughout entire mixing process). Blend in egg then blend in vanilla extract and pumpkin puree. With mixer set on low speed, slowly add in dry ingredients and mix until combined. Mix in chocolate chips and pecans (if you want some chocolate to show through set some aside to press into tops before baking). Let batter rest 5 - 10 minutes (this just gives the oats some time to absorb the liquids so batter isn't so sticky and cookies don't spread so much). Scoop dough out 2 Tbsp at a time (I used a 1 1/2-inch cookie scoop, which I recommend using for evenly shaped cookies and fill it heaping), and drop onto Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheets, spacing cookies 2-inches apart. Bake in preheated oven 12 - 14 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheet several minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Stir until smooth, and then blend in the cold water. Add vanilla; stir until thoroughly blended and smooth. Set aside.In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the granulated sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 5 minutes to add all of the sugar, then add the brown sugar, taking an additional 3 to 4 minutes, beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugars, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the cocoa mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and cocoa mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and place pans on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pans and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.Peppermint candies can be finely ground using a food processor or a small food grinder, or place in a heavy duty plastic bag with a resealable top and crush the candies with a hard implement such as a rolling pin, wooden spoon, hammer, etc. Set aside.In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt white chocolate. Or, place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, use 50% power and stir frequently just until the chocolate is melted; do not overheat as chocolate will burn easily. Set aside to cool. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Turn the heat off and place a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl on top of the hot water, the upper pan should not touch the water.In a large bowl of an electric stand mixer beat the butter on medium high speed about 1 minute until it is smooth. Add confectioners sugar and salt, beat at medium speed until thoroughly combined and smooth, about 1 minute. Add whipping cream and vanilla and beat at medium speed until well mixed, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Transfer one-half of the frosting to a medium size mixing bowl; stir in the melted and cooled white chocolate. Stir  cup of the ground peppermint candies into the other one-half frosting.Place one of the layers on a cake plate. Using an offset spatula spread  of the peppermint candy frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and spread the remaining peppermint candy frosting over the top. Place the last cake layer on top.Reserve about  cup of the white chocolate frosting for the garnish.Crumb coat the cake by covering the sides and top of the cake with a thin layer of white chocolate frosting. Let the cake sit, or refrigerate, until the crumb coat is dried to the touch. At this point you can cover the cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate to firm the layers, about one hour or overnight. Tip: the crumb coat is a thin layer. Dont worry if the cake shows through in places, it will be covered again with the final layer of frosting.When the crumb coat is set, cover the sides and top of the cake with the remaining white chocolate frosting.Gently press the remaining 1 cup of crushed peppermint candies around the sides of the cake. Optional: Leave the top of the cake plain, or sprinkle peppermint candies over the top.Re-whip reserved frosting, if necessary to make fluffy, and place reserved white chocolate frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a round decorating tip (I used a #12 tip.) Pipe a ring of dots around the base of the cake, and pipe 6 medium sized swirls onto top of cake; lean 1 whole peppermint candy against each swirl. Tip: if frosting to be used for piping seems too soft, beat in some extra confectioners sugar, about  to  cup, or if seems to thick beat in about 1 tablespoon of whipping cream.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-peppermint-cake-533535", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 155, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Clean and Delicious", "cuisines": ["spanish", "european"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Spanish-Tortilla-521781.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 521781, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spanish Tortilla", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Clean and Delicious", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 lbs. baby potatoes, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "baby potatoes", "metaInformation": ["thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11352, "unit": "lbs"}, {"originalString": "12 egg whites (1.5 cups)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1124, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "8 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1034053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3 cups of sliced leeks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "leeks", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/leeks.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11246, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "Salt and pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 63.0, "sourceUrl": "http://cleananddelicious.com/2012/02/29/video-spanish-tortilla/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 20, "instructions": "Pre heat oven to 400.In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and eggwhites.

You still want some strawberry chunks in the final ice cream, so don't liquefy it. Just a few pulses should do it. Set aside.Place finely chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Heat 1 cup of heavy cream in a saucepan until it just starts to bubble. Pour over chopped chocolate and let sit for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Pour back into saucepan along with milk, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and mixture just starts to steam.In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks. Slowly ladle in some of the warm chocolate mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, until about half of the chocolate mixture has been incorporated and yolks are warm to the touch. You want to do this gradually; doing so will temper the egg yolks rather than cook them.Pour entire yolk mixture back into the saucepan and return to medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan as you do, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 to 7 minutes (it will measure approximately 170\u00baF on a thermometer). Do not let it to boil. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/2 cup cream and chopped strawberry mixture.Pour into a zip-top freezer bag and seal. Place in a bowl filled with ice water, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooled to room temperature. Alternatively you can use a traditional ice water bath, with a smaller bowl nested inside a larger bowl filled with ice water. When cool, transfer to refrigerator (cover with plastic wrap if using a bowl) and chill for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight.When custard base is completely chilled, churn ice cream according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the ice cream is the consistency of soft serve.

Mix in about 1 cup of the dark chocolate chunks.Turn half the batter out into prepared pan, pushing the dough into pan. Sprinkle on the remaining dark chocolate chunks and then place the remaining half of the dough over the chunks. Some of the chunks will most likely be sticking out, that is fine.
