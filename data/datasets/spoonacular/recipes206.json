The mixture will be pretty thick and chunky at this point.Add in the  cup water and puree again until blended and smooth. The water helps to get the dip to a creamier consistency. Feel free to add a bit more water to get the dip to a consistency that you like. I found that using  cup or splash more was perfect.The dip can be stored in a well sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.Next, let's make up your quinoa.  Bring the 1 cup well rinsed quinoa and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium sauce pan. Once the quinoa has come to a boil, give it a stir, cover it, and reduce the heat to simmer. Cook the quinoa until all the water is absorbed, about 10-15 minutes. Note: Please check your package of quinoa for cooking instructions, as they all vary.The quinoa is done when its tender and you can see the little quinoa curlicues.Now, let's assemble the wrap!Assembling the wrap is all a personal preference.  Some of you are going to want huge wraps and others of you are going to want a smaller wrap.  So with that being said, take the amount of quinoa that you want to put in your wrap and put it in a small bowl, add in some black beans and then heat up the quinoa and black bean mixture either via the stove top or microwave.Mix in some of the avocado tahini dip to the quinoa and black bean mixture.  The amount of avocado-tahini dip you add in is to taste.  I like to add in enough to make the quinoa a bit creamy.  The more avocado-tahini dip you add, the more flavor the quinoa will have.Note: If I'm going to microwave the quinoa mixture, then I just add in the avocado-tahini dip at the same time as the black beans.You can heat up your tortilla and melt your cheese anyway you wish.  This is just what I do. Get out a tortilla and place it in a dry skillet over medium heat.  Add to one half of the tortilla the Monterey jack cheese and feta.  Flip the other half over like you're making a quesadilla, and let the cheese melt.Take the cheesy tortilla and place it on a plate.  Top the tortilla with some spinach.Add the quinoa mixture and then top it off with some fresh diced avocado.Wrap it up like a burrito and enjoy!I've also enjoyed this quinoa salad sans the wrap. I've taken the black bean and quinoa mixture and put it in a bowl and topped it with some diced avocado and feta cheese.  It's good anyway you eat it really.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/quinoa-wrap-with-black-beans-feta-and-avocado-694036", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish",

You want the dough to be thin but not transparent.5.  Assemble the empanadas:  Use an overturned bowl (about 4 inches across) to cut out circles.  Gather scraps together, re-roll and cut more circles until you\u2019ve used up all the dough.  Scoop some filling into the center of the dough circle (about 2 Tbsp.).  Wet the edge of the dough with water, using your finger to to rub.  Fold the dough over to form a half-circle.  Crimp edges with a fork, or fold over decoratively (using more water, as needed, to act as \u2018glue.\u2019)  Repeat the process until all of the filling is used.  The empanadas can be frozen at this point, or placed onto a baking sheet.  If baking right away, chill the filled empanadas for a few minutes.  Prick the top of each empanada twice with a fork.  Beat 2 egg yolks with 2 Tbsp. water and brush egg wash over each empanada.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.6.  Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
