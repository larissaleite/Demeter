Roughly dice the scallions, garlic, and ginger. Add them to a food processor. Seed the habanero peppers (wear gloves if you can) and hten mince them finely. Add them also.2) Add all the other ingredients to the food processor and pulse until a dark, rough paste is formed.Set this aside until needed. You can make this days in advance.To make the Mango Chutney:1) Dice the mangoes and onions.2) Add vinegar and sugar to a large pot and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Then add onions and mangos. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes.3) Add all the other ingredients and continue to simmer until the chutney thickens substantially and reduces by about a third. This will take about 35-40 minutes over medium-low heat. Stir it regularly to make sure it isn't sticking.4) Once the chutney is cooked down, remove from the heat and let cool completely. It will thicken more as it cools.This is best to make the day before if possible.For Pulled Pork:1) Rub pork butt thoroughly with the jerk rub. You should use all of the rub. Wrap the pork butt tightly in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for 24 hours.2) Remove pork butt from fridge an hour before grilling it.3) Place pork butt on a grill and try to keep the temperature right around 240-250 degrees.

Let sit for five minutes. Add two cups of flour and stir together to form a loose sponge. Let sit for an hour. It should foam and double in size.2) Once sponge is ready, add oil and salt to it and start adding more flour in half cup increments. You can either use a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment on medium to incorporate the dough, or just stir it with a wooden spoon in a large bowl until it comes together.3) Once the dough comes together, turn it out on a floured surface and knead it for 8-10 minutes until it is soft, but not sticky at all.4) Divide the dough into six equal portions and roll the dough into a tight ball, rub each portion with olive oil and store in the fridge.5) Remove dough at least an hour before you want to grill it.6) To grill the dough, roll the dough ball into a flat round. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea (or kosher) salt and pepper.7) Add dough to a clean, very hot grill and cook for about 90 seconds per side.
