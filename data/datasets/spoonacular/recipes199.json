Mix the peeled apple chunks with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and fold the cinnamon apples into the batter, making sure not to overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-32 minutes or until the edges have lightly browned and the middle jiggles just slightly. Place the pecans on a rimmed cookie sheet and bake them for 4-7 minutes, stirring them halfway through, or until they smell roasted. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. When the blondies have cooled, prepare the frosting. In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix together the brown sugar, butter, milk and salt. Whisking continuously, bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 1 minute, while continuing to whisk continuously. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the salt and vanilla (it will bubble). Gradually whisk in 2/3 cup powdered sugar and mix until smooth and no lumps of sugar remain. Taste and add up to another 1/3 cup powdered sugar, if desired. Stir occasionally for about 3 minutes or until the frosting has slightly thickened. Immediately pour over the cooled blondies. If it's thickened too much, place back on the heat for a few moments. Spread the frosting over the cooled blondies and top with the chopped pecans. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Can be stored at room temperature for 1 day.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/apple-blondies-824068", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 9, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Housewife in Training Files", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Apple-Pie-with-Oatmeal-Cookie-Crumble-556574.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 556574, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Apple Pie with Oatmeal Cookie Crumble", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 91.02, "creditText": "The Housewife in Training Files", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 large apples, washed and sliced into \u00bc inch slices", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apples", "metaInformation": ["washed and sliced into \u00bc inch slices", "large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 9003, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 T cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "1 package Pillsbury Oatmeal Brown Butter Cookies, or cookie dough", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "sugar cookie dough", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cookie-dough.jpg", "unitLong": "package", "unitShort": "pkg", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18205, "unit": "package"}, {"originalString": "1 T cornstarch, or tapioca starch to make gluten free", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "tapioca starch", "metaInformation": ["gluten free"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93696, "unit": "T"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 48.0, "sourceUrl": "http://thehousewifeintrainingfiles.com/apple-pie-oatmeal-cookie-crumble/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
