Add the bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes.Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Pour in the wine and let bubble 1 minute, stirring and scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.Add the butternut squash, beans, tomatoes and their juice, salsa, 1 cup water, the chili powder, cumin, cocoa, cinnamon and cayenne, if using. Bring the chili to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender and the chili begins to thicken, about 1 hour. (If the soup looks too thick while cooking, add up to 1 cup more water.) Serve topped with a dollop of Greek yogurt and some avocado cubes.Cook's Note: If you're using dried beans, soak in water overnight, then simmer until just tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (or cook 4 to 5 hours in a slow cooker on high).Photograph by Antonis Achilleos                                                    Recipe from Supermarket Healthy: Recipes and Know-How for Eating Well Without Spending a Lot.

Place the pot over medium heat and, swirling but never stirring, bring the mixture to a boil. Brush the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush if any sugar crystals cling to the edge of the pot.Allow the mixture to boil until it is a deep amber color and the sugar smells like dark caramel, about 6 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and, very carefully as it will bubble up, whisk in the coconut milk, heavy cream, and butter. Once the butter is melted let the caramel cool to room temperature. Left-overs can be stored in the refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to a month.For the topping combine the flour, sugar, and coconut in a small bowl and toss to combine. Add the cubed butter and, with your fingers, rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter is combined and the mixture has a crumbly texture. Cover and chill until ready to use.Heat the oven to 350 F and line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners, or place 12 paper baking molds on a baking sheet.In a medium bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to combine and set aside. In a separate bowl combine the coconut milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla and beat until well combined. Pour the went ingredients into the dry and stir until the dry ingredients are just moistened, about 10 strokes. Add the pineapple, coconut, and lime zest and fold to combine evenly, about 4 to 5 additional strokes.Divide the batter among the prepared baking cups. Top each with the crumble topping and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown and spring back when gently pressed in the center. For muffins baked in a muffin pan, cool in the pan for 3 minutes then transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool to room temperature. For muffins baked in paper molds cool to room temperature on the baking sheet.While the muffins cool prepare the glaze. In a small bowl combine the powdered sugar and the Coconut Caramel Sauce. Whisk until smooth. The mixture should be runny, but form a ribbon when drizzled into the bowl. If the mixture is too thick add coconut milk \u00bd teaspoon at a time until it thins out.Once the muffins have cooled drizzle them with the glaze.

Lightly grease a 8\"x8\" panIn a saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter, then add the sugar and stir to combine. Return the mixture to the heat briefly, just until it's hot, but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating this mixture a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.Transfer the sugar mixture to a medium-sized mixing bowl, if you've heated it in a saucepan. Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso powder, and vanilla.Whisk in the eggs, stirring until smooth.Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth.Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 8\"x8\" pan.In a medium sized bowl, combine the coconut, salt and condensed milk. Stir to combine. Dot the coconut mixture evenly over the brownie batter and use a knife to swirl the coconut mixture into the brownie mixture.Sprinkle almonds over brownies.Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it. The brownies should feel set on the edges, and the center should look very moist, but not uncooked.

Once you see those bits, turn off the heat and continue to whisk constantly for about 30 seconds, until the butter is golden brown. Be careful not to burn the butter - those bits can turn black quickly.Transfer the browned butter to a small bowl (make sure you get all those caramel bits in the pan!).

Add the leeks and saute just until they start to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute about 1 minute more. Add the carrots and celery and continue sauteing until the vegetables deepen in color but have not yet begun to brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Pour the stock into the pan, bring it to a boil, and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Sprinkle in a generous pinch of salt.Tie the peppercorns, thyme, and parsley in a square of cheesecloth, securing it with kitchen string. Add this bouquet garni to the pan. Stir in the beans, zucchini, summer squash, and tomato. Continue simmering until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, make the Pistou: Put the garlic and tomatoes in a blender or food processor with about 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Begin processing. With the machine running, add the basil leaves, and then pour in enough extra-virgin olive oil to make a smooth, thick, but fluid paste. Transfer about 2/3 of the paste into a serving bowl to pass alongside the soup.Make the Goat Cheese Croutons: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Brush the bread slices with olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and turn on the broiler. Spread 1 side of each crouton with goat cheese and put it back on the baking sheet. Broil until the cheese is warm and slightly bubbly, about 3 minutes. Set aside.When the soup is ready, stir the remaining pistou into the saucepan, ladling some of the hot broth into the blender or processor bowl to swirl and rinse any pesto clinging inside into the pan. Remove and discard the bouquet garni. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with a little more salt.Ladle the soup into individual heated serving bowls. Float a crouton in the center of each bowl. With a spoon, drizzle a little more pistou over the crouton and soup in each bowl. Serve immediately, passing more pistou alongside for each person to add, to taste.

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and get butter, eggs and milk out of the refrigerator in time to get to room temperature before you start.2. Make the cupcakes as usual: put all the cake ingredients, bar the milk, into the food processor and combine, adding milk to bind. Using spoon and rubber spatula fill the cake cups equally and bake for 20 minutes or so, until cooked. Remember the cakes rise as they bake: there is enough mixture to fill each cup adequately even if you panic when you first look at it. The cake should be cooked through and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave for 5 minutes or so and then arrange the cupcakes in their paper liners on a couple of wire racks to cool.3. Cool the cupcakes as for the lemon cupcakes, and slice off any humped top.4. Make up the icing according to package instructions, dyeing the mixture faint lilac with a spot or two of food coloring. I like to use the solid pastes, for which you may have to go to a specialist cake decoration shop, I\u2019m afraid; the color you\u2019ll want here is generally labeled \u201cgrape violet.\u201d Go carefully, though: we want pastel serenity here, not seventies record-sleeve murk.5.

Add dry ingredients and mix just until combine (batter will be thick).Divide batter among 12 paper lined muffin cups filling each about 2/3 full (about 1/4 cup batter in each). Bake in preheated oven 16 - 20 minutes (lesser for gooier brownies). Allow to cool in muffin tin several minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely then pipe Marshmallow Frosting over cupcakes and toast edges of frosting with a kitchen torch if desired.Add egg whites, granulated sugar and cream of tarter to a heat proof bowl of an electric mixer. Set bowl over a saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water.  Heat mixture, whisking constantly until egg whites are warm to the touch and sugar has dissolved, about 3 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer bowl to electric stand mixer fit with a whisk attachment. Beat mixture beginning on low speed and gradually increasing to high speed, until stiff glossy peaks form, about 5 - 7 minutes. Add vanilla during the last 10 seconds of mixing.

Line a 12-cup cupcake/muffin pan with cupcake liners. Set aside.Melt the butter and chocolate together in the microwave. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring between each time. You may also melt the butter and chocolate over low heat on the stovetop. Stir until smooth and set aside to slightly cool.In a medium sized bowl, toss the cocoa powder, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together until thoroughly combined. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together until smooth. Add the cooled butter/chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add half of the flour mixture, then half of the buttermilk. Repeat until everything is added. Stir until *just* combined; do not overmix. The batter will be very thick like pudding.Divide the batter between 12 liners in your cupcake pan. Bake for 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting.For the frosting: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for 1 minute. Switch the mixer to low speed and slowly add the confectioners sugar. Quickly stir the cooled white chocolate so that it is smooth and add to the butter/sugar mixture. Switch the mixer to medium speed and beat for 2 minutes until combined and creamy. Add the cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat for 1 minute until combined. Frost the cupcakes and top with melted chocolate drizzle and chocolate sprinkles, if desired.Cupcakes stay fresh at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 4 days.

Indent the middle of one side on each one slightly.In a large cast iron skillet over medium heat (or 2 small ones if need be) bring your butter to nice melting point, then lay your burgers inside. Although to cool for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. You want them browned but not cooked through.Take the sliders out and place them on a plate for the time being.Drain some of the fat if there's a lot. I used lean so I had no need to drain it out. You want a little in the pan.Pop the shallots and onions into the pan and splash them with a touch of balsamic vinegar. Now start to brown them over that same medium heat. Stir often to avoid sticking. They should be ready in about 3 to 5 minutes depending on your heat and pan.Now pour in the whiskey very carefully. Remember it's alcohol so you don't want to start a flame. Turn off the burner if you're nervous, then pour it in and turn the burner back on. I use a gas stove and I left mine on but I am super careful while pouring it. Now allow that whiskey (or broth) to come to a nice boil and let it reduce by about half. Only take a few minutes to happen.Now you can add the BBQ sauce to the pan, stir everything till it comes together. Now reduce the heat to a nice simmer, and pop your sliders back inside the pan. You want them to cook in that while it bubbles up and thickens. Wait about 4 or 5 minutes, then flip over. Cook according to how you like your meat. I'm a well done gal myself so this took about 8 to 10 minutes at a slow bubble. You don't need to cover it. Just keep and eye on things.Once it's done take a separate pan and slap some butter on each bun. Turn them butter side down on the pan or griddle and let them brown up. This is optional, if you don't like your buns toasty that's cool. No judging here. Now take your bottom bun and slip a slider on it. Take some of the shalloty-oniony dripping and just slather it over top of the slider. Place the top bun on.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking dish with butter and add the broccoli and cauliflower. Roast until slightly browned, about 15 minutes.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter, whisk in the flour and let it cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn the heat off, whisk in the half-and-half, then turn the heat up to high and keep whisking to avoid the flour from clumping. Add the Cheddar, salt and pepper and whisk until the cheese is melted.Remove the broccoli and cauliflower from the oven and pour the Cheddar mixture over the top. Sprinkle evenly with the breadcrumbs and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Add the bacon grease and butter to a large stockpot over high heat. Add the Anaheim chiles, poblano chiles, red bell peppers, jalapeno chiles and onions, and cook until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute longer. Add the chuck and brown, about 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage and brown, stirring gently, trying not to break up the ground beef too much. Cook until the meat is nicely browned and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the chili powder, cayenne, coriander, cumin, granulated garlic, granulated onion, paprika, salt and black pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.Add the tomato sauce and paste, and stir to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Stir in the beer and stock. Add the kidney and pinto beans; lower the heat and simmer, about 2 hours.Serve the chili in bowls over Double-Fried French Fries and garnish with crackers, green onions and Cheddar.                                                            Peel the potatoes on the sides, leaving the ends with the skin on. Cut the potatoes into 1/3-inch slices and then slice into 1/3-inch sticks.Fill a large bowl with water and soak the potatoes, submerged, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. This will help remove the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing.Fit a heavy stockpot with a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil to 325degress F.Remove the potatoes from the water and pat dry to remove excess water. Carefully place two handfuls of potatoes into the hot oil. There should be at least 1 inch of oil above the potatoes. Parcook until the potatoes are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes, gently shaking off the excess oil and let them drain on a rack. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are parcooked. Raise the heat of the oil to 350 degrees F. Cook the potatoes again, two handfuls at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oil, shake off the excess oil, place in a bowl and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are cooked.Makes 8 servings.

                                    In a medium bowl lightly beat egg yolks with a 1/4 cup of sugar and set aside. In a medium saucepan add cream, milk, salt, and remaining sugar. Heat mixture over medium low heat, whisking occasionally, until bubbles begin to form along the edges of the pan. Remove from heat and add heated cream mixture to eggs one tablespoon at a time while whisking constantly.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Once the cream mixture and eggs have been combined return to the saucepan and heat on medium low until mixture coats back of a spoon or spatula and line drawn with a finger leaves a distinct trail.

Set bowl over an ice bath. Let cool at room temperature for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, then cover and refrigerate for 2 more hours or until completely chilled.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            While the custard is chilling, prepare your cookies. In a medium bowl whisk together, flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add 14 tablespoons softened butter and sugar and beat on medium high speed until light and creamy about 3 minutes. Add flour mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined, then add milk and vanilla and beat until dough comes together.  Remove dough from bowl and shape into two logs that are approximately 1 1/2  inches in diameter. Wrap dough logs with plastic wrap or waxed paper and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour or place in freezer for about 30 minutes or until logs are firm enough to slice.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Slice thin wafers (about 1/8 inch thick) from the cookie log and place at least 1 \u00bd inches apart on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake cookies for 5 minutes, rotate pan and continue baking until edges of cookies are slightly crisp, about 5 to 8 minutes longer.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the pan then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cookies are completely cooled place in a large zipper lock bag and coarsely crush them.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            In a medium bowl combine 2 cups of cookie crumbs with remaining melted butter until crumbs are thoroughly moistened.

Transfer half of the ice cream to the prepared springform pan, spreading it with a spatula to completely cover the crumbs. Cover ice cream evenly with half of the remaining crumbs then repeat, covering  those crumbs with remaining ice cream and topping off the cake with crumbs.

Ensure you pack it down firmly.Then pour over the cheesecake filling and spread it around so its even.Place in the oven and bake for approx. 45-47 minutesWhen its done, it will just start to go golden around the edges, and it will jiggle slightly in the middle shake it side to side slightly.If it still seems too liquidy in the middle, bake for a few minutes longer.Allow to cool completely, then put into the fridge and allow to chill completely.Will take 1-2 hours to completely chill in the fridge.Keep stored in the fridge with tin foil over top of the pan.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/key-lime-cheesecake-protein-bars-558616", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cooking With My Kid", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/spaghetti_brussel_sprouts-10515.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 10515, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spaghetti & Brussel Sprouts", "creditText": "Cooking With My Kid", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "20 small brussel sprouts", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "brussel sprouts", "metaInformation": ["small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brussels-sprouts.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 20.0, "id": 11098, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "juice of 1 large lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3-4 tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1033, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "freshly cracked pepper & sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea-salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 lb whole wheat spaghetti", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "whole wheat spaghetti", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-wheat-spaghetti.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10020124, "unit": "lb"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.cookingwithmykid.com/dinner/spaghetti-brussel-sprouts/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 12, "aggregateLikes": 13, "instructions": null, "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/spaghetti-brussel-sprouts-10515", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Fountain Venue Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Strawberry-Salad-with-Creamy-Poppy-Seed-Yogurt-Dressing-482666.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 482666, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Strawberry Salad with Creamy Poppy Seed Yogurt Dressing", "creditText": "Fountain Venue Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 head romaine, butter, or leaf lettuce or spinach (or a mixture of several)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce leaf", "metaInformation": ["(or a mixture of several)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93623, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup mayonnaise", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mayonnaise", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 4025, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup non-fat milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "non-fat milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1085, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt (I typically use 0% fat;

Take 2 tablespoons of the milk and combine it with the cornstarch to create a slurry, whisking constantly. Set aside. Add the bourbon to the milk. Measure out the heavy cream and add the corn syrup to it. Add the mascarpone to a large bowl and whisk in the salt. Set aside.To make the burnt caramel, I used Jeni's dry burning technique. You have to keep an eye on the caramel the ENTIRE time! Heat a large (Jeni calls for 4-qt) saucepan over medium heat and add sugar, make sure it is in one layer cover the whole bottom of the pot. Literally watch the sugar until it begins to melt and the outsides turn caramely and melty. Once there is just a small amount of white sugar remaining in the center, use a heat proof spatula and scrape the melted sugar from the sides into the center. Continue to do so until all of the sugar is melted, and stir well. Watch sugar as it begins to bubble and once the edges are bubbly and releasing smoke and the sugar turns a dark amber color, remove from heat. The only way to truly judge it right before it BURN burns is to carefully stand over top and smell/watch. The minute you remove it from the heat, add a few tablespoons of the cream/corn syrup mixture (be careful - it will spit!) and whisk constantly to combine. Slowly add the remaining cream very slowly, whisking constantly.Place the saucepan back over medium heat and add the milk/bourbon mix. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil (for me, this is over medium heat, and it takes a few minutes to achieve. Do NOT remove your eyes from the milk as it can easily bubble up and over, so have a spatula on hand and turn the heat down if necessary, increasing again slowly) and once boiling, boil for 4 minutes. Remore from heat and whisk in the cornstarch slurry, whisking to combine. Place back over heat and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring with a spatula until slightly thickened. Gently pour mixture into the large bowl with the mascarpone and whisk to combine.Fill a large bowl with ice and ice water, placing an open gallon-sized ziplock bag in the water, bottom down. Pour the mixture carefully into the bag, the press the air out and seal. Chill for 30-45 minutes. Once chilled, set up your ice cream make according to it's directions and pour the ice cream in. Churn according to directions. For my kitchenaid, I churned for 20 minutes. 5 minutes before finishing, add in toffee pieces. Once churned, spread in a freezer-safe container and place a piece of plastic wrap on top, pressing against the ice cream. Freeze for 4-6 hours before serving.

Stir until red wine cooks down. Then add thyme and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer, turn heat down to low, and simmer, uncovered, until sauce reduced to 4-5 cups of liquid, about 30-45 minutes.3) For loaf, chop mushrooms, garlic, and leeks and add to a large pan with olive oil over high heat. Cook until veggies reduce down and most of the liquid evaporates, about 15 minutes.4) Let cool to room temperature and then mix with all the other loaf ingredients in a large bowl. You might need to add more or less bread crumbs based on how much liquid your veggies had.5) Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap and scoop in your loaf mixture. Invert on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Remove pan and plastic wrap to leave a free-standing loaf.6) Bake loaf at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove and brush on glaze. Return to the oven to cook for another 15-20 minutes (Note: If you use meat instead of mushrooms, you'll need to cook this for closer to 75 minutes total).7) Back to gravy, mix soft butter, flour, and cream together to form a smooth paste.8) Whisk paste into simmering sauce until smooth. Simmer until thick and silky smooth. Taste for salt and pepper.9) Serve gravy and sliced loaf together. Garnish with fresh thyme.OPTIONAL STEP: Slice loaf and then pan fry the slices in a skillet with a tiny amount of vegetable oil for a few minutes per side over high heat to crisp up the sides of the slices.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mushroom-meatloaf-537756", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "How Sweet Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/No-Bake-Smores-Cheesecakes-525584.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 525584, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "No Bake S'mores Cheesecakes", "creditText": "How Sweet Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "chocolate ganache", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "chocolate", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-chocolate.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19081, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup whipped cream cheese, at room temperature", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1017, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "graham cracker crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 10018617, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "marshmallow cheesecake", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "marshmallow", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marshmallows-mini.png", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19116, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup marshmallow fluff or cream", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "marshmallow fluff", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93644, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 marshmallows, toasted and cut in half", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "marshmallows", "metaInformation": ["toasted", "cut in half"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marshmallows-mini.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19116, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 ounces milk chocolate, chopped", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "milk chocolate", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-chocolate.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19081, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "crust & topping", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "pie crust", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 18334, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sweetened condensed milk", "metaInformation": ["sweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/evaporated-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1095, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 22.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/08/no-bake-smores-cheesecakes/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 23, "aggregateLikes": 6505, "instructions": "In a small bowl, mix together butter and graham crumbs until moistened.

Place the steak in the marinade and let marinate for at least an hour, and up to 48 hours.  If marinating for more than an hour, keep chilled until an hour before you plan to cook.2 When ready to cook, remove steak from marinade, reserving the marinade.  Place steak on a plate and set aside.  Place marinade in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil for 10 minutes, or until the marinade has reduced to a thin glaze, becoming your teriyaki sauce.Please note that if you are concerned by the idea of reusing the marinade after raw steak has been sitting in it, you will be boiling the heck out of this marinade, killing anything that may have decided to grow in it during the marinating process.  Also steak isn't the same as chicken.  People eat steak raw (beef carpaccio).  Salmonella is not a problem with steak; it is with chicken.  If you are still concerned, make twice as much marinade, and reserve half to boil down to make the sauce, using the other half as a marinade.3 If grilling the steak, prepare your grill for high, direct heat.  If pan frying, heat a large cast iron pan on high heat.  If grilling oil the grill grates.  Pat dry the steak.  Rub a little olive oil or grapeseed oil all over it.  Place the steak on the hot grill or pan. Sear for 3-5 minutes on one side, or until the side is well browned, and turn the steak over and sear the other side.  Baste the steak with teriyaki sauce.  When the steak is well seared on both sides, remove from the heat and let rest for 10-15 minutes.4 Notice the direction of the grain of the steak.  It should like like striations in the muscle fibers of the steak.  Slice the steak in half, following the grain of the steak so that you are slicing along the grain.  (This will make it easier to make cuts across the grain.)  Then make thin slices (1/4-inch) against the grain and on a slight diagonal.  Slicing this way will break up the muscle fibers, making this naturally tough cut of meat quite tender.If there are juices that run out of the steak as you cut it, add the juices to the teriyaki sauce.  There's lots of goodness in the steak \"jus\" that you don't want to waste.Arrange on a serving plate and pour the remaining teriyaki sauce over it.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
