"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. If using a pizza stone, place it in the lower third of the oven.In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and salt. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles course crumbs. If you wish, this can also be done in a food processor. Slowly drizzle in the ice water, about tablespoon at a time and toss until the dough just comes together. It will still be crumbly (take care not to make the dough too wet). Place in the center of a sheet of plastic wrap, using the wrap to bring it into the shape of a ball, wrapping as you go. Press it into a disk form and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.Toss the fruit in a bowl with the sugar and cornstarch and set aside as you shape the dough.Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll out into a disk about 12 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick. It does not have to be perfect. Arrange the fruit in the center of the disk. Gently bring up the edges of the dough, folding and crimping a little along the way towards the center of the galette. Lightly brush the exposed dough with heavy cream or half and half.

Bake for 10-12 minutes, just until the cookie edges start to brown.  Cool completely on the cookie sheet.Cassie's Notes:I chose dried blueberries for these cookies because they are a pantry staple for us.  They don't bust and bleed into the rest of the dough like fresh berries do.  If you prefer fresh, try popping them into the freezer for a while before adding them to the dough and then very gently stir them in.  I have not tried this recipe with fresh blueberries so I'm not sure what the final result is like.A couple of ideas for adaptations:-if you have a fresh vanilla bean, add the caviar instead of using vanilla extract-zezt a lemon and add about 1 teaspoon of zest when you add the vanilla extract, or add a little freshly squeezed lemon juice to the creamed butter/sugar/eggs-reduce the blueberries to a heaping 1/2 cup and add a 1/2 cup white chocolate chips", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blueberry-vanilla-pudding-cookies-552513", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 36, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "For the Love of Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Spicy-Roasted-Chicken-Drumsticks-497122.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "GAPS_5", "id": 497122, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spicy Roasted Chicken Drumsticks", "creditText": "For the Love of Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 tsp black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002030, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "6 chicken drumsticks", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken drumsticks", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-drumsticks.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 5066, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tsp dried thyme", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "dried thyme", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2042, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1022020, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp onion powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "onion powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2026, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 tsp paprika", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "paprika", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2028, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 45.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.fortheloveofcooking.net/2014/03/spicy-roasted-chicken-drumsticks.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 92, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.Combine all the seasonings together in a bowl; mix until well combined.Season the chicken drumsticks evenly with the seasonings.

If making carrot decoration, tint half of the remaining frosting with orange gel coloring (or red and yellow) to reach desired vibrancy, then tint remaining half with green. Pipe carrot greens with a tiny round tip and orange carrot with a medium round tip. Store in an airtight container in refrigerator. Allow to rest at room temperature before serving.Using an electric mixer, whip together butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Mix in vanilla extract. With mixer running on low speed, slowly add powdered sugar and beat until well blended and smooth, about 1 minute longer.*To very finely shred carrots use the small holes on a box grater and use fairly gentle pressure so they are thinly shredded, short pieces.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes-with-cream-cheese-frosting-543858", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Baby-Shower-Raspberry-Dip-419536.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 30, "id": 419536, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Baby Shower Raspberry Dip", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "neufchatel cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/neufchatel.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1031, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup fresh raspberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "raspberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raspberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9302, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon raspberry extract", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "raspberry", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raspberries.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9302, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1056, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup white sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white sugar", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 6.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Baby-Shower-Raspberry-Dip/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 21, "instructions": "In a medium bowl, place the sour cream, Neufchatel cheese, white sugar and raspberry extract.

the lamb: Put a large frying pan on medium heat with a good glug of oil. Run your fingers down the thyme sprigs to release their leaves and sprinkle them all over a large plate. Add a little salt and pepper and then squish the lamb chops or cutlets into the mix, turning them over to coat both sides. (This will give a lovely crust when cooked.) Fry them in the pan until they are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, depending on how you like them done, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer them to a plate to rest for a few minutes, covered with foil (this will make them much more tender and juicy).Meanwhile, trim and slice the spring onions. Add the spring onions and salmonds to the frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring every now and then, until the onions are wilted and the almonds golden, 1 to 2 minutes.For the couscous: Meanwhile, put some water on to boil.Pour the couscous into a medium bowl and just cover with the boiled water. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for about 5 minutes.For the glaze: Combine the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and butter in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer, leaving it to bubble away for about 3 minutes, stirring from time to time. Once thickened and syrupy, remove from the heat and keep warm.Check that the couscous grains have absorbed all the water and are tender, then fluff it up with a fork. Crumble the feta cheese in, season with salt and pepper and add a good drizzle of oil. Stir together and re-cover to keep warm.Divide the couscous among four serving plates. Sit the rested lamb chops on top and drizzle the glaze (and any resting juices) over. Scatter over the spring onion and almond mix. Rip up the mint leaves and scatter them over the top. If using, top with the pomegranate seeds and serve.

Water kills chocolate!Place the milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and Oreo pieces. Spread in prepared pan.

Cook, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and peppermint/candy cane pieces. Spread over chocolate layer.
