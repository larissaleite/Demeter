Place the milk, flour, eggs, melted butter, and salt in a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.2. Lightly coat a small nonstick pan or crepe pan with cooking spray and place over medium-low heat.3. Swirl a scant 1/4 cup (2 fluid ounces) of batter around bottom of the pan, then return the pan to the heat to cook. Watch for tiny pinhole bubbles to break on the surface. Flip when the edges turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Shake the pan to loosen the crepe or use a small spatula.4. Cook the other side until golden brown, about another minute. Remove the crepe and reheat the pan before adding more batter. Re-coat with cooking spray after every other crepe, and occasionally stir the batter. The crepes can be made a day or two in advance and can be frozen for up to a month. (If freezing, place each crepe in between a sheet of parchment or wax paper, wrap the stack of crepes with plastic wrap, and place in a resealable plastic bag before freezing. Then simply pull out exactly the number that you need when a craving strikes.)Make the filling5. Stir the sugar and water together in a small, high-sided saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without further stirring, until the sugar is golden brown, about 4 to 6 minutes. Swirl the pan toward the end to promote even coloring. Remove from the heat.6. Slowly pour the apricot nectar into the hot caramel, a little at a time, to avoid splattering.7. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the nectar dissolves into the caramel, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the butter, and let cool slightly. You can make the filling up to this point 1 day in advance. Store covered in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, gently stir in the mango and papaya slices.Serve the crepes8. Place a crepe on a dessert plate. Top with 1 tablespoon of sauce and a slice of papaya and mango.9. Roll up the crepe and drizzle with a little more fruit syrup. Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and add a sprig of mint.

Then, stir in sugar, a third at a time, until completely incorporated. (I find this easiest to do with my clean hands.) Next, I form into a big rectangular block so that I can slice into equal-size pieces for rolling. At this point, you may wrap in parchment or wax paper, and then again in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to a few days.When ready to make the eggs, the dough is easiest to work with when cold. Using about a tablespoon of the mix at a time, form into oval or egg shapes, placing them on a parchment or wax paper-lined baking sheet as you go. When finished, you may again cover and refrigerate until you are ready to coat the eggs in chocolate.Finally, melt the chocolate in a double boiler, keeping the heat very low.  Dip the eggs and remove to a parchment-lined baking sheet. I like to keep twenty or so out at a time, leaving the remaining eggs in the refrigerator. They will be easier to dip when they are cold. I have tried the utensils made for dipping chocolates, toothpicks, and any way I can think of to make this process easy and less messy! The way that has ultimately worked best for me is to use a dinner fork. I drop the egg in the chocolate, roll gently to coat, and lift it out with the fork. Hold the egg on the fork for a few seconds, allowing the excess chocolate to drip back into pot, and then gently slide off the fork and onto baking sheet. If you end up with \u201cfeet\u201d\u2013a puddle of chocolate that pools around the egg\u2013you can gently break this off once the chocolate hardens. My kids, however, think these are the best ones because they get more chocolate!Note: One year, I thought I would be smart and put the dipped eggs on a cooling rack figuring this was a fast, easy way to drain the excess chocolate. Don\u2019t do it! The eggs stick to the rack, even if greased, and the bottoms will break off when removed.If you want to try tempering chocolate: I\u2019ve had a few questions on this subject, so here is a quick how-to.  I used to buy the chocolate melting disks that don\u2019t require tempering, which is totally fine.  Chocolate with a higher cocoa butter content will require this step.   The main risk you run if you don\u2019t temper it properly is that the finished chocolate looks a little streaky. It will still taste fabulous. What I do, however, is melt a portion of the chocolate at a time\u2013maybe 8 ounces\u2013over low heat in a double boiler. Then turn the heat off and add about a quarter cup (no need to measure, just a small handful) of chopped chocolate and stir it in. This brings the temperature back down which is how it tempers. I turn the heat back on when I need to add more chocolate or if the chocolate cools too much and starts to thicken. Repeat the process as needed, adding a little more chopped chocolate after the bigger chunks are melted.When you are melting chocolate in the microwave (which I often do when making Oreo, pretzel or salted almond bark; see website for these recipes), you can use a similar process. Just heat in 30-second intervals, stirring as you go. When all chocolate is just melted, stir in some chopped chocolate and let it melt in the heat of the already warm chocolate. I do find that the stovetop method works best for the extended process of egg dipping.Once dipped, the chocolate should be put in a cool place to set up properly. I put the baking sheets of dipped candy in the refrigerator or near a cool window to set and fully cool.Stored in an airtight container and refrigerated, the eggs will keep for several weeks\u2013if they last that long!

Then, stir in sugar, a third at a time, until completely incorporated. (I find this easiest to do with my clean hands.) Next, I form into a big rectangular block so that I can slice into equal-size pieces for rolling. At this point, you may wrap in parchment or wax paper, and then again in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to a few days.When ready to make the eggs, the dough is easiest to work with when cold. Using about a tablespoon of the mix at a time, form into oval or egg shapes, placing them on a parchment or wax paper-lined baking sheet as you go. When finished, you may again cover and refrigerate until you are ready to coat the eggs in chocolate.Finally, melt the chocolate in a double boiler, keeping the heat very low.  Dip the eggs and remove to a parchment-lined baking sheet. I like to keep twenty or so out at a time, leaving the remaining eggs in the refrigerator. They will be easier to dip when they are cold. I have tried the utensils made for dipping chocolates, toothpicks, and any way I can think of to make this process easy and less messy! The way that has ultimately worked best for me is to use a dinner fork. I drop the egg in the chocolate, roll gently to coat, and lift it out with the fork. Hold the egg on the fork for a few seconds, allowing the excess chocolate to drip back into pot, and then gently slide off the fork and onto baking sheet. If you end up with \u201cfeet\u201d\u2013a puddle of chocolate that pools around the egg\u2013you can gently break this off once the chocolate hardens. My kids, however, think these are the best ones because they get more chocolate!Note: One year, I thought I would be smart and put the dipped eggs on a cooling rack figuring this was a fast, easy way to drain the excess chocolate.

Meanwhile, stir cocoa and water in a small bowl until smooth. Cool.                                                                                            Place oven rack in lowest position. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk oil, egg yolks, vanilla and cocoa mixture. Add to dry ingredients; beat until well blended. Add cream of tartar to egg whites; with clean beaters, beat on high speed just until stiff but not dry. Fold a fourth of the whites into batter, then fold in remaining whites.                                                                                           Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake 60-65 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely, about 1 hour.                                                                                            Run a knife around side and center tube of pan. Remove cake to a serving plate. For filling, in a large bowl, combine all ingredients until smooth; refrigerate for 1 hour.                                                                                            Beat until stiff peaks form. Cut a 1-in. slice off the top of the cake; set aside. To make a tunnel, carefully hollow out bottom, leaving a 1-in. shell. Fill tunnel with some of the filling; replace cake top. Spread remaining filling over top and sides of cake. Store in the refrigerator.

Whisking all the while, slowly pour in the rest of the hot milk. Add the chocolate and whisk it in gently until it\u2019s melted and the custard is smooth. Rap the bowl against the counter to pop any bubbles that might have formed, then pour the custard over the bread and press the bread gently with the back of a spoon to help cover it with liquid. Leave the pan on the counter, giving the bread the back-of-the-spoon treatment now and then, for 30 minutes.5. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).6. Put the baking dish holding the unbaked pudding into the roasting pan, and then slide the pan setup into the oven and very carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the pudding pan. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the pudding is uniformly puffed, the top is dull and dry, and a thin knife inserted deep into the center comes out clean. Transfer the baking pan to a rack and let it cool. You could serve this pudding warm, but it\u2019s better at cool room temperature or even chilled\u2014it also cuts better when it\u2019s cold. Serve the pudding simply with a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar or less simply with vanilla (or rum or Grand Marnier or brandy) cr\u00e8me anglaise, chocolate sauce, or whipped cream, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/four-star-chocolate-bread-pudding-597065", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 105, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Onion-Meatball-Stew-387344.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 387344, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Onion Meatball Stew", "preparationMinutes": 20, "pricePerServing": 95.97, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup soft bread crumbs", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "bread crumbs", "metaInformation": ["soft"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 medium carrots, cut into 3/4-inch chunks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["medium", "cut into 3/4-inch chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 can (10-1/2 ounces) condensed French onion soup, undiluted", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "condensed french onion soup", "metaInformation": ["undiluted", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-soup.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 6354, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 egg, lightly beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["lightly beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh parsley", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11297, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 garlic clove, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic clove", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 medium onion, cut into thin wedges", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["medium", "cut into thin wedges"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potatoes", "metaInformation": ["medium", "peeled", "cut into 1-inch chunks"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11362, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon dried savory", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "summer savory", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 98961, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 74.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/onion-meatball-stew", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a large bowl, combine the egg, bread crumbs, garlic, salt and savory.
