Set aside.In a small sauce pan or microwave bowl, heat the oil, honey and vanilla until combined.Slowly pour into the oat mixture and stir until well combined.Spread onto the baking sheet in an even layer and bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.Allow the granola to cool and break up any large pieces.  While the granola cools, mix the glaze by combining the cream, powdered sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in a small bowl.  Place some granola on a plate or bowl and drizzle the glaze over the top.Store in an airtight container.  Cassie\u2019s Notes:This recipe can be easily doubled. Measure the oil before measuring the honey, the honey will come out of the measuring spoon much more easily when it follows the oil.If you don\u2019t like coconut, feel free to leave it out or use less.  I\u2019m not a huge fan but for some reason, I love it in granola.  When it is cooked, it adds a bit of a nutty flavor that I love. I prefer Bob's Red Mill coconut flakes and organic golden flax. They didn't pay me to say that, I just prefer their brand.  They are easy to find, affordable, and I always have good luck with their products in my recipes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cinnamon-roll-granola-552726", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Lobster--Avocado-and-Feta-Salad-with-Lemon-Vinaigrette-534745.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 534745, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Lobster, Avocado and Feta Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 890.22, "creditText": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 avocadoes, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "avocadoes", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 9037, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "8 cups torn Boston Bibb lettuce", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "boston bibb lettuce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/Butter-or-Boston-Bibb-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 8.0, "id": 11250, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1034053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 ounces feta cheese, cubed or crumbled", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": ["crumbled", "cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1019, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 clove garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "1 lemon, juiced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": ["juiced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup kalamata olives", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "kalamata olives", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/calamata-or-kalamata-olives.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1009195, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 lb cooked lobster meat, chopped", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "lobster meat", "metaInformation": ["cooked", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lobster.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10115147, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1 red bell pepper, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["diced", "red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11821, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Salt and pepper, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://sarahscucinabella.com/2013/06/06/lobster-salad-with-avocado-feta-lemon-vinaigrette/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 14, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Arrange the lettuce on four places.

Mix in the sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure all is mixed in. Add the eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in the sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan on the rack above the roasting pan. Bake the cheesecake for 40 to 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely (4 to 5 hours or overnight).3.
