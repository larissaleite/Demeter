Sprinkle salt over the vegetables while they cook. Increase the heat to medium-high and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes. 4 Add the tomato paste and stir well, saut\u00e9 for another 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. Increase the heat to high and add the tomatoes, the pancetta, herbs and red wine. Nestle the beef roast into the pot, cover, place in the 300\u00b0F oven and cook for 3 hours. At the halfway point, use tongs to turn the beef roast over. 5 Remove the pot from oven and transfer beef to a large bowl; tent with foil to keep warm. Allow the liquid to settle in the pot for a few minutes, if you'd like, skim off some of the fat with a wide shallow spoon. If you have an immersion blender, use it to blend the contents of the pot. If you don't, use a whisk to help break down the vegetables. Boil the sauce until it is reduced to about 3 1/2 cups. Strain liquid through large fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with spatula to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have a couple cups strained sauce. Add any accumulated juices from the bowl you have the beef in. Boil the sauce again until it has reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.5 Cut the meat into roughly 1/2-inch-thick slices and pour the sauce over them. Serve with a bold red wine and crusty bread or mashed potatoes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/beef-roast-braised-in-zinfandel-245068", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main
