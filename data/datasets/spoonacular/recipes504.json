Pour the warm peanut butter mixture over the popcorn and stir with a long-handled wooden spoon until completely coated.On a baking sheet lined with wax paper, pour the coated popcorn and distribute evenly. Drizzle with the melted semisweet chocolate, and then drizzle with the white chocolate. Sprinkle the crushed pretzels over the warm popcorn. Allow the chocolate to set about 20 minutes (or speed up the process by placing the baking sheet in the refrigerator). Once the popcorn is set, serve in a large serving bowl. Store tightly covered.

The browner the plantains are, the sweeter they will be and the easier the skin is to take off.Now place a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons of coconut oil to heat up, then add the halved plantains to the skillet. Cook on both sides for about 3-4 minutes until browned, making sure not to burn them.Once the plantains are done cooking, add them to the food processor and puree until they begin to clump together.Then add the maple syrup, coconut oil, eggs, and coconut milk and puree until smooth. No clumps should be present at this point.Now add coconut flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt to the food processor and puree one more time to combine everything well.Now line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grab an ice cream scoop to help form perfect sized biscuits.Scoop the batter out and plop each biscuit on the baking sheet about 1 inch away from each other. My batter made 8 biscuits.Place in oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until slightly brown and completely cooked through.Let cool. These babies are hot and need to settle afterwards.Eat with grass fed butter, or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care. As well as my favorite jam. Which be on tomorrow\u2019s post. Haha.
