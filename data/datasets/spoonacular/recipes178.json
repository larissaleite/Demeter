Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, brown sugar, baking powder, ground ginger, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cranberries and candied ginger. Make a well in the center of the mixture.In a small bowl, stir together the egg, whipping cream and molasses. Add this mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir until ingredients are combined.Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough about 10 times, or until nearly smooth.Divide dough in half and lightly pat each half into a 5'' to 6'' circle, about 3/4'' thick. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Place wedges about 2'' apart on parchment lined baking sheets. In a small bowl, combine egg white and water. Brush tops of scones with egg white mixture and sprinkle with coarse sugar to your liking.Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a crack in top of scones comes out clean. I recommend letting them cool a few minutes and serving them warm and fresh.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gingerbread-and-cranberry-scones-497693", "dishTypes": ["morning meal",

Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise, scoop out the flesh into a medium bowl, and lightly mash with a fork. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until cool, at least 20 minutes. 4. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.5. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to incorporate the butter into the flour mixture until the dough is crumbly and contains lumps the size of small peas. 6. Add the cooled sweet potatoes and \u00bc cup of the heavy cream and lightly stir into the flour mixture. Add the remaining \u00bc cup cream and the buttermilk and stir until just mixed. Do not overwork the dough.7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together into a cohesive mass. Lightly coat your hands with flour and gently pat the dough into \u00be-inch-thick rectangle (mine was about 11x9 inches in size). Cut the dough into 6 squares, then cut each square on the diagonal to make triangle-shaped scones.8.

Make the Glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, maple syrup, heavy cream and salt, until smooth.
