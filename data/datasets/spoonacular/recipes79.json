Let it sit for 15 minutes so the dough is easier to use.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.Add  the butter to a skillet over medium heat, add the mushrooms then cook, stirring occasional for 3-4 minutes.  Add the ham and cook, for 1 minute; remove from the skillet and set aside.  Coat the same skillet with cooking spray over medium heat.   Whisk the eggs together with the milk, sea salt, freshly cracked pepper, and cayenne pepper, to taste.  Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Constantly fold the egg mixture from the bottom of the pan to the top. This will keep it from overcooking and the middle section will stay soft and fluffy. Do this constantly for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the eggs are just set.  Don't overcook - they will finish cooking in the oven.  Remove from the heat then add the mushroom and ham mixture as well as the green onions to the eggs and gently mix until combined. Roll (or spread) the dough out on top of the silpat mat into a rectangle.  Place the egg down the center of the dough.  Add the scrambled egg mixture then the cheese on top.  Cut even slits on both sides of the filling with a pizza cutter. Fold the ends over the filling then starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across the filling.Place into the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let it rest for 1-2 two minutes before slicing and serving.

Make the Caramel: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and corn syrup with \u00bc cup water, stirring them together carefully so you don't splash the sides of the pan. Cook over high heat until an instant-read thermometer reads 350 degrees F, or until the mixture is dark amber in color (keep a close eye on the caramel at all times, as it goes from golden brown to black and burnt very quickly), 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, and slowly add the cream (careful, it will bubble up) and then the fleur de sel. Whisk in the sour cream. Set aside to cool.2. Make the Brownie Batter: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.3. Butter the sides and bottom of a glass or light-colored metal 9x13-inch pan. Line the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper, and butter the parchment.4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and cocoa powder.5. Place the chocolate and butter in the bowl of a double boiler set over a pan of simmering water, and stir occasionally until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and combined. Turn off the heat, but keep the bowl over the water of the double boiler, and add both sugars. Whisk until completely combined and remove the bowl from the pan. The mixture should be at room temperature.6. Add three eggs to the chocolate mixture and whisk until just combined. Add the remaining eggs and whisk until just combined. Add the vanilla and stir until combined. Do not overbeat the batter at this stage, or your brownies will be cakey.7. Sprinkle the flour mixture over the chocolate. Using a spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until there is just a trace amount of the flour mixture still visible.8. Assemble the brownies: Pour half of the brownie mixture into the pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Drizzle about \u00be cup of the caramel sauce over the brownie layer in a zigzag pattern, making sure the caramel doesn't come in contact with the edges oft he pan or it will burn. Use an offset spatula to spread the caramel evenly across the brownie layer, leaving about a \u00bd-inch border around the edges. In heaping spoonfuls, scoop the rest of the brownie batter over the caramel layer. Smooth the brownie batter gently to cover the caramel layer.9. Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, and check to make sure the brownies are completely done by sticking a toothpick into the center of the pan. The brownies are done when the toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.10. Remove the brownies from the oven and sprinkle with the fleur de sel and coarse sugar.11. Cool the brownies completely before cutting and serving.12.

Use an oven thermometer to be sure your oven temperature is exact. Slight variances will cause large changes in your results.In a medium bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, almond flour, and cocoa powder. Set aside.In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy with an electric hand mixer fitted with wire whipping beaters and set to low speed. (You're looking for the consistency of bath tub bubbles.)Add the cream of tartar and beat for a few seconds more.While beating, slowly add the granulated sugar. Continue to beat until you have nearly stiff peaks, 1-2 minutes. (To tell if you have nearly stiff peaks, stop beating, and lightly dip the beaters into the meringue. When you pull the beaters out of the meringue, the peaks that form should stand up, with the tips folding over only slightly.)Sift half of the almond flour mixture into the bowl with the meringue. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the meringue for a few strokes, using a circular motion around the bowl and under the batter. Sift in the remaining almond flour mixture and continue to fold, until the dry ingredients are completely incorporated into the meringue. The batter should be smooth and glossy. It should slowly shift if you tip the bowl, but it should not be too runny or liquidy.Fill a large pastry bag fitted with a  inch tip with the batter. (If you dont have a pastry bag, you can use a quart Ziploc bag with one corner snipped to create a  inch hole.)Gently pipe the batter into 2 inch circles spaced 1 inch apart onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. To pipe, hover your tip a  inch above the cookie sheet and squeeze the bag gently. The meringue should flow in an even circle outward from your tip. Stop piping when you have a 2 inch diameter circle. Gently lift your tip. The batter should flatten into itself after a few seconds, but if it forms a small beak, thats ok. Well take care of those in a minute.After piping your cookies, if they still have a small beak, dip your finger in a bowl of cool water to slightly dampen it. Gently pat the piped meringue to flatten the beaks and create a smooth top.Let the piped cookies rest until a dry film forms on the macaroon, the batter should lose its shininess and become dull in color. You should be able to lightly touch the cookies and the batter shouldnt stick to your finger. This could take anywhere from 20-40 minutes, depending on the batter and the moisture level of your kitchen.Bake the rested macarons at 325F for 14-15 minutes until crisp on the outside and dry to the touch. (The foot should not squish or wiggle when you lightly touch them.)Remove the macarons form the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 15-20 minutes before gently removing them from the parchment paper to cool on a wire rack completely before filling.While the cookies are cooling, make the filing. Beat butter and jam with an electric hand mixer fitted with wire whisk beaters on medium speed until the butter is fluffy and the two are combined. Slowly add the powdered sugar until a thick and fluffy frosting forms. It should be spreadable but firm.When cookies are completely cool, spread about 1 tsp of filling on the bottom of one cookie. Gently sandwich the filling with a second cookie, pressing until the filling nearly reaches the edges of the cookies.Store the filled macarons in a sealed container on the counter for up to a week or in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.We recommend filling the sandwiches no more than 1 day before you plan to serve them. If you want to make your cookies ahead of time, keep the cookies, unfilled, in a sealed, dry container, until you are ready to fill them.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-french-macarons-with-raspberry-filling-828728", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 105, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "White Lights On Wednesday", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Oatmeal-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-593077.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 593077, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "White Lights On Wednesday", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup packed brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1\u00be cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.75, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 cups rolled oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "rolled oats", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semi sweet chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 10019903, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 14.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.whitelightsonwednesday.com/2012/07/sugar-coated-sundays-oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 216, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugars until fluffy and light in color.

Rub evenly onto both sides of the chicken and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Dump the veggies into the grill basket, and place the chicken onto the grill beside the basket. Cook the chicken until no longer pink inside, about 10-12 minutes total, flipping once half way through the cooking time. When you flip the chicken, give the veggies a good stir.Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm while the veggies finish. Turn the grill heat up to medium high and cook the veggies for another 7-10 minutes until nice and charred, giving a stir half way through the cooking time.Transfer the cooked veggies back into the large bowl and add in the tomato, cucumber, cilantro and mint. Toss to coat evenly.Add in the fresh lemon juice and toss to coat. Finally, add in the tahini and toss until the veggies are nice and creamy.Divide the veggies and chicken between two bowls, followed by the olives and pistachios.DEVOUR!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/paleo-grilled-moroccan-chicken-bowls-785304", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": true}, {"sourceName": "Mels Kitchen Caf\u00e9", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/White-Chocolate-Macadamia-Nut-Cookies-Perfected-569531.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 569531, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies Perfected", "creditText": "Mels Kitchen Caf\u00e9", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened", "(2 sticks)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "macadamia nuts", "metaInformation": ["coarsely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/macadamia-nuts.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12131, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "12 ounces white chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white chocolate chips", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 10019087, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 12.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.melskitchencafe.com/perfect-white-chocolate-macadamia-nut-cookies/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 116, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

"aggregateLikes": 27, "instructions": "Make the chocolate cake1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Lightly grease the inside of three 9-inch layer cake pans (1 1/2 inches deep) with shortening, line the bottom of each pan with a circle of waxed paper cut to fit, grease the paper, and dust with flour.2. Combine the melted chocolate and boiling water in a small, heatproof bowl. Mix well. Cool to tepid. When tepid, the chocolate mixture will have the consistency of moderately thick pudding. Use the mixture tepid, not cold.3. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper.4. Cream the butter in the large bowl of a freestanding electric mixer on moderate speed for 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar in 4 additions, beating for 1 minute after each portion is added. (Do not skimp on the beating time.)5. Add the light brown sugar and beat for 1 minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 45 seconds after each addition. Blend in the vanilla extract and chocolate mixture. On low speed, alternately add the sifted flour mixture in 3 additions with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the sifted flour mixture. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl frequently to keep the batter even-textured.6. Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, dividing it evenly among them. Spread the batter evenly.7. Bake the cake layers in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until risen, set, and a toothpick inserted in the center of each layer withdraws clean or with a few crumbs attached. Cool the layers in the pans on racks for 10 minutes. Invert the layers onto other cooling racks, peel away the waxed paper, and cool completely.Make the chocolate frosting8. Place the melted chocolate and melted butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty freestanding electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on low speed to mix until smooth.9. Blend in half of the confectioners\u2019 sugar and the salt. Beat on low speed for 1 minute. Add the remaining confectioners\u2019 sugar and beat to combine. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 1 minute. Increase the speed to moderately low and beat for 2 minutes.10. Add the heavy cream. Increase the speed to moderately high (#7 on a heavy-duty KitchenAid freestanding mixer) and beat until shiny and very creamy, about 8 minutes longer.11. Cover the frosting and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm enough to spread. Re-beat the frosting for 1 to 2 minutes on moderately high speed just before using. If the frosting seems slack, or is in a hot kitchen, beat in up to 2/3 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time.Assemble the cake12. Tear off four 3-inch-wide strips of waxed paper. Place the strips in the shape of a square around the outer 3 inches of a cake plate.13. Center one cake layer on the plate (partially covering the waxed paper square; the strips should extend by at least 1 inch). Spread over a layer of frosting. Carefully position the second layer on top. Cover with a layer of frosting. Top with the remaining cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Once the frosting is set, gently remove and discard the strips of paper.14.

Spread the filling over the cookie crust and bake for 40-45 minutes, until the edges are set and the center is slightly firm (a little softness is ok but you don't want it to be really jiggly). Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack.For the mousse, heat 1/2 cup cream in a small saucepan until just simmering. Place the egg yolks in a small bowl. Whisking vigorously, pour a couple tablespoons of the hot cream into the egg yolks and continue whisking until completely combined. Pour the tempered egg yolks into the saucepan with the remaining hot cream, whisking quickly the whole time, and return the saucepan to medium-low heat, cooking while stirring constantly, until the cream/egg mixture bubbles and thickens, 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips, whisking until the mixture is smooth and the chocolate is completely melted. If you used a darker chocolate and would like a bit more sweetness, whisk in up to 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, whisking occasionally to avoid a skin forming across the top. When completely cool, beat the remaining 1/2 cup cream to stiff peaks and gently fold into the completely cooled chocolate mixture. Spread the mousse over the top of the cooled cheesecake pie and refrigerate.While the pie chills, make the ganache by combining the butter and heavy cream in a saucepan over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is simmering. Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and stir until glossy and smooth. Stir in the vanilla and powdered sugar.

1/8 cup of batter and pour it in the hot skillet.

sheetPosition an oven rack 4 to 5 inches from the heating element, and preheat the broiler. Brush a 10-by-15-inch broiler-safe rimmed baking sheet with oil.Put the turkey, egg, breadcrumbs, scallions, fish sauce, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl, and mix gently, just enough to incorporate evenly. Drop mounds of the mixture all around the prepared baking sheet, and press them into an even layer. Score the meat into 24 even squares, cutting down almost all the way. Brush the top with the hoisin sauce. Broil until the meat is browned and glazed and registers 165 degrees F on a meat thermometer, 8 to 9 minutes.Carefully pour off any excess liquid from the cookie sheet. Rescore the meat into 24 sliders, then follow the score lines with a spatula to divide. Top each slider with a cucumber slice and a cilantro leaf.While the sliders are cooking, arrange the lettuce, remaining cilantro, carrots, onions and lime wedges on a serving platter. Put the peanuts and Sriracha if using in small serving bowls. Slide a spatula in the pan and let guests build their sliders with their desired toppings.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.
