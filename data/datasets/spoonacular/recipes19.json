Remove from the refrigerator 20 minutes prior to cooking to let the meat come to room temperature.Heat a large grill pan coated in cooking spray over medium high heat. Remove the tenderloin from the marinade then lightly season both sides with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste. Place the tenderloin in the HOT grill pan then cook for 5 -6 minutes before flipping and cooking for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the next 5 ingredients (through optional salt), and mix on low speed until just incorporated, about 1 minute; don't overmix. Add the candy corn, white chocolate chips, and mix until just incorporated. Using a medium 2-inch\u00a0cookie scoop, form heaping two-tablespoon mounds (I made 20). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter. Important note -\u00a0Strategically place candy corn so that it's not baking directly on cookie sheet because it will melt, burn, or turn runny if it is. The candy corn pieces need to be in the interior of the cookies, shielded and buffered by dough. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a\u00a0Silpat\u00a0or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if slightly undercooked, pale and glossy in the center. Do not overbake because cookies will firm up as they cool. Baking longer than 10 minutes could result in cookies with overly browned undersides. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet \u00a0for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooking.\u00a0Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be

Remove the bowl from the stand, and finish stirring by hand to avoid overmixing.Divide the batter evenly among the lined muffin cups, and bake until the cupcakes bounce back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.For the glaze: Combine the butter, chocolate, honey and salt in a small microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and poke a hole in it to vent. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) for about 1 minute, until the butter and most of the chocolate is melted. Whisk until smooth, and let cool, 15 to 20 minutes. Dip the top of each cupcake in the glaze, and let it set up, about 30 minutes.Decorate the cupcakes: Pinch each fruit chew into a curved horn shape with pointed ends. Cut the licorice laces into twelve 5-inch pieces, and snip 1 end of each to make a Y-shaped tail. Press two horns into the top of each cupcake, and press a tail into the back of each cupcake.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.

Can't believe February is over and gone. Makes me wonder why so much always gets packed into such a short month but I am relieved that all the projects have been completed and deadlines met. So, \"Hello March! Let's get going!\" Yep, this month is definitely another kind of busy, filled with travels, workshops and visits and you can bet I am looking forward to the change of scenery. Oh yes.Taking small breaks throughout the work day is vital for everyone. You've probably noticed it just by peeking your head outside for 10 minutes or taking a walk with a colleague. One thing I find most invigorating is lunch. I can't do without. I guess it stems directly from my childhood when my mom would pick us from school for lunch. She had nothing against cafeteria meals but she enjoyed taking the time to do it. It was nothing fancy really but breaking away for an hour also meant picking up a new book at the library, getting more stickers at the book store, stopping by the bakery for a treat. A little fun in the middle of a long work day. Always a treat when you are a kid. Or an adult.I love a good salad with tons of colorful vegetables, sometimes topped with a hard boiled egg, or two. Soups are another favorite staple but nothing says lunch break more than a savory tart and a side salad to me. Quintessential French bistro food. One that warms my very soul being so far away from home. One that makes me feel all grown up although I have been there for a while. Savory tarts are the perfect vessels to get a good dose of all the food essentials your brain and body need to function properly without too much effort or planning. Once you have the crust, thrown in anything that strikes your fancy or whatever you have on hand. The sky is the limit regarding fillings, spices, herbs, etc...Funny thing is that in my family a savory tart is also the meal of choice for any exhausted traveler. Whenever we go home, I know our first meal will be my mom's quiche Lorraine with a salad and my dad's shallot vinaigrette. Whenever they come visit, there is quiche ready for them to get a quick bite after a long day of travel. How did it come to be this way? I don't know. It's tradition. And you don't mess with tradition. Well at least no this one, ehehe.I guess you can call this Swiss Chard, Goat Cheese and Prosciutto tart a rehearsal of sort for my parents' arrival in two weeks. I finally came up with a savory gluten free crust that I am in love with. Tastes good, bakes good and rolls like a charm. For the filling, I used what I had on hand: a bunch of Swiss chard languishing in the fridge, some goat cheese and prosciutto left over from a tapas night with friends. Next time it might simply be bacon and onion. Who knows...I can't believe I'll be in L.A on Wednesday and Seattle on Sunday! If you are registered for any of the workshops, well, \"thank you\" in advance and I can't wait to meet you! There are some tweet-ups/meet-ups being organized as I write this so if you are interested, the best thing is to check my Twitter feed (@SweetTartelette) or any of the (crazy - awesome - fun) gals who will be showing me around town this week: Rachael (@fujimama), Jen (@jenjenk) and Gaby (@WhatsGabyCookin).Since I know it's going to be pretty tight to get any major post in and to avoid a major \"post travel\" blog post, I thought I'd do quick and fun entries throughout the weeks. Capturing the moment. I have never been to any of these cities so I figured it'd be fun to post quick accounts of things that strike me. Landscape, people, food, the macaron and photography workshops, whatever... I am looking forward to it all and everything in between.Gluten Free Swiss Chard, Goat Cheese and Prosciutto Tart:Serves 4For the crust:5 tablespoons (70gr) unsalted butter, at room temperature1 teaspoon Dijon mustard3 egg yolkspinch salt1/2 cup (80gr) brown rice flour1/2 cup (60gr) millet flour1/4 cup (30gr) sorghum flour1/4 cup (40gr) tapioca starch(or 1.5 cups of all purpose flour if not using gf flours)1/2 teaspoon xantham gumFor the filling:2 tablespoons olive oil1 medium onion (I used 1/2 of a giant sweet Vidalia), sliced thin1 bunch Swiss chard (red - green rainbow - your choice), washed and patted dry4-6 slices prosciutto3 eggs, slightly beaten2/3 cup whole milksalt and pepperpinch of freshly grated nutmeg4 to 6 oz (120gr - 180gr) crumbled goat cheesea few sprigs of thymePrepare the crust:In a mixer, whip together the butter and mustard on medium speed until light and airy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time and beating well after each addition. Mix until incorporated. Add all the different flours, and the xantham gum and mix briefly. Dump the whole mixture onto a lightly floured (use more rice flour) board and gather the dough into a smooth ball. Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour.Preheat oven to 350F and position a rack in the center.When the dough is nice and cold, roll it out on a lightly floured board or in between two sheets of plastic to fit your prefered pie pan. (I went with rectangular this time) If the dough tears while you roll or/and transfer into the pan, just patch it with your fingertips. Line the dough with a piece of parchment paper, fill with pie weights or dy beans and par bake for 15-20 minutes until completely done. Remove the weights and parchment paper. At this point you can refrigerate the baked crust for up to 5 days if not using right away or freeze it for up to 3 months.Prepare the filling:Preheat the oven to 350F and position a rack in the middle.Heat the oil in a large sautee pan over medium high heat and cook the onion until translucent (about 3-4 minutes), add the Swiss chard and cooked until wilted. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. In the same pan, quickly sautee the slices of prosciutto to get them nice and crispy. Remove from the pan.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Layer the onion and Swiss chard at the bottom of the crust and slowly pour the egg mixture over it. Top with slices of prosciutto and crumbled goat cheese.Bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the tart starts getting golden brown and the custard is cooked. Spinkle with freshly chopped thyme.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Le P'tit Coin Francais:Tarte aux Bettes, Chevre et Prosciutto:Pour 4 a 6 personnes:Pour la pate:70gr beurre mou, non sale1 cc moutarde de Dijon3 jaunes d'oeufpincee de sel80gr farine de riz brun60gr farine de millet30gr farine de sorghum40gr de farine de tapioca(ou de 210gr de farine blanche)1/2 cc de gomme de xanthamPour la garniture:2 cs d'huile d'olive1 oignon moyen, coupe en tranche fine1 petite bottes de bettes4-6 tranches de prosciutto3 oeufs, legerement battus150ml lait entiersel, poivrepincee de muscade fraiche120gr a 180gr de fromage de chevre emiettequelques brins de thymPreparer la pate:Dans le bol d'un mixer, battez le beurre et la moutarde pendant 2 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, carrots and bell pepper and saute, stirring frequently, until the vegetables begin to brown and soften slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the ground turkey and stir until the meat turns white and begins to color very slightly around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the herbes de Provence and stir, 1 minute. Add 4 cups broth, tomatoes and rice. Bring to a boil. Stir in the kale and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and the freshly ground black pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle each serving with parsley and Parmesan, if using, and serve.

Using a sharp knife, remove the tenderloin from the underside of the duck breast and reserve for another use. Trim any ragged bits or gristle from the underside of the duck, and then turn the breast over and trim any excess fat from the edges. Pat the duck completely dry with paper towels.2. Place the duck, skin side up, on a cutting board. Score the skin with the tip of the knife by making shallow diagonal cuts, 1/2 inch apart, in one direction and then repeating in the other direction, creating a diamond pattern. Season both sides of the duck (that is, the skin side and the meat side) with the salt, then massage with the garlic paste (again on both sides), and then press the crushed peppercorns evenly onto the surface (again on both sides). Put the duck on a platter and set aside for at least 1 hour at room temperature. (You can instead cover and refrigerate the duck overnight; bring to room temperature before cooking.)3. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Carefully add the duck breast, skin side down, and let it sizzle for several minutes. Using tongs, check to see that the skin is not browning too quickly and that the garlic is not burning, and if necessary, reduce the heat. Be careful; the duck breast will render a fair amount of hot fat. Cook until the duck skin is golden and crisp, 6 or 7 minutes. Turn the duck breast over and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer the duck to a carving board and let rest for at least 10 minutes. Reserve the rendered duck fat in the skillet, allowing it to cool to room temperature and then straining it into a jar and refrigerating it for future use.Make the parsley salad4. Pick the parsley leaves from the stems\u2014you want about 2 loosely packed cups. Wash and gently dry with a clean towel.5. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, garlic, and oil.6. At the very last moment before dinner, turn the parsley leaves into a serving dish, add a sprinkle of salt, and then gently toss with the dressing to coat lightly.

powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add the buttermilk and eggs. Whisk together, gradually incorporating the flour mixture, just until combined. Add the banana slices and gently combine; the batter may be slightly lumpy. Let stand 10 minutes.Place a griddle pan over medium heat. Add the canola oil and butter. Using a ladle, pour 1/2 cup batter for each pancake, roughly 2 inches apart. When small bubbles appear across the surface of the pancakes and the edges lift from the griddle, flip and continue cooking until the pancakes are golden brown on the second side, about 4 minutes per side. Continue with the remaining batter.In a small dish using a rubber spatula, mix the peanut butter and maple syrup until combined. For each sandwich, spread some peanut butter mixture over a pancake, then top with another pancake.

Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Arrange the sweet potatoes in the pan in a single layer and cover with a circle of parchment paper to keep the surface moist. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Cover the skillet with a lid (keep the parchment in place) and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. A toothpick inserted into the thickest part of a piece should meet no resistance. If the chunks are not yet tender, add a bit more water and simmer for another minute or two. Check to make sure the sugar doesn\u2019t burn.                                                                 Once the potatoes are tender, remove the lid and parchment and jiggle the skillet to allow the potato chunks to roll around in the rapidly reducing glaze (the vinegar, by the way, will keep the sugar from seizing after the glaze has cooled). After 6 minutes or so, the water and oil in the skillet will have separated and most of the water will have evaporated, enabling you to remove the lightly glazed sweet potato chunks with little or no oil clinging to them.                                                                 Transfer the glazed chunks to a plate, spreading them out in a single layer. Sprinkle with the black sesame seeds. Let cool to room temperature before serving. They keep at cool room temperature for 6 to 8 hours. If you will be keeping them longer, place them in a covered container and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
