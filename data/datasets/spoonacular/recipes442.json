Saute for about 5 minutes, until everything begins to soften. Add all the mushrooms and saute until soft. Add to the bowl of ground nuts.Add the lentils, vegetable broth, breadcrumbs, oregano, thyme, sage, and basil. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.Crack one egg into a bowl and beat. Pour over the mushroom mixture and mix well.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Spray a loaf pan with nonstick spray.Roll out the puff pastry. It should be wide enough to fit inside your loaf pan, covering both long walls, with enough overhang on each side to fold back over the filling we put inside.Place the puff pastry in the loaf pan. Evenly spread the mushroom mixture into the pan, pushing down to compact it if it seems like theres too much. Stretch and fold the flaps of pastry over the filling, enclosing it.Beat the second egg in a small bowl. Brush the egg over the top of the pastry. You wont need to use all of it, just give it a nice, even coating. This will help the loaf to brown.Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake for another 40 minutes, until the loaf is golden brown. Slice and serve with the mushroom gravy.FOR THE MUSHROOM GRAVY:Saute the mushrooms in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil until soft.In a saucepan, mix the vegetable broth and mushroom water (or regular water) with the cornstarch or flour until smooth. Add the mushrooms and the herbs, to taste.Heat the gravy over medium-high heat until your desired thickness is reached, adding cornstarch or flour as needed to thicken it. If its too thick, add some water or vegetable broth.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mushroom-nut-roast-756975", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "greek", "european"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Greek-Deli-Kabobs-388610.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 388610, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Greek Deli Kabobs", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 57.64, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "24 fresh broccoli florets", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "broccoli florets", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broccoli.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 24.0, "id": 10011090, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup Greek vinaigrette", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "Greek froyo", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/frozen-yogurt.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93629, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 pound part-skim mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "part-skim mozzarella cheese", "metaInformation": ["cut into 1/2-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-white.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1028, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "24 slices hard salami", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "salami", "metaInformation": ["hard"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salami.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 24.0, "id": 7071, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "2 jars (7-1/2 ounces each) roasted sweet red peppers, drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "roasted red peppers", "metaInformation": ["sweet", "red", "drained"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 14.0, "id": 11916, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 48.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/greek-deli-kabobs", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/plastic-bag.jpg", "id": 221671, "name": "ziploc bags"}], "step": "Cut red peppers into 24 strips; place in a large resealable plastic bag.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add the remaining ingredients.

Since it is Easter, we make crosses on a couple of the loaves.Lay towels over the loaves and let raise in the pan for about an hour.Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.Brush the tops of the loaves with the egg wash, and bake (typically two loaves at a time will fit nicely in the oven at once) for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown, and sound hollow when lightly tapped (see photo #9).Allow to cool completely before removing from the pans. Then slice and serve (see photo #10).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/paska-ukranian-easter-bread-for-sundaysupper-492928", "dishTypes": ["bread"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Daydreamer Desserts", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Bull-by-the-Horns-Martini-554995.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 554995, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Bull by the Horns Martini", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 298.63, "creditText": "Daydreamer Desserts", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 blue cheese olives", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "blue cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blue-cheese.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1004, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bd ounce dry vermouth", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry vermouth", "metaInformation": ["dry"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14132, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd ounce olive brine", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "olive", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olives-mixed.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9195, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "3\u00bd ounces vodka", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "vodka", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vodka.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 3.5, "id": 14051, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc ounce bloody mary mix", "aisle": "?", "name": "bloody mary mix", "metaInformation": [], "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.25, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 1.0, "sourceUrl": "http://daydreamerdesserts.com/2014/03/bull-by-the-horns-martini.html/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Combine vodka, vermouth, hot sauce, olive brine, and bloddy mary mix into a cocktail shaker filled half way with ice.
