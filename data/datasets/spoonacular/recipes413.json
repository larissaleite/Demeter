fresh tomato, for garnish, optionalDiced avocado, for garnish, optionalShredded lettuce, for garnish, optionalHomemade or commercial tortilla strips, for garnish, optionalSour cream, for garnish, optionalInstructionsHeat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat, add the ground beef and onion and cook until beef is browned, breaking it up as it cooks. Add the garlic and cook another minute. Stir in the ranch dressing and taco seasoning packets and cook and stir for another minute. Add the un-drained, diced tomatoes, Rotel tomatoes, and green chilies; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir in the beef broth and the undrained chili beans. Drain and rinse the kidney beans and pinto beans; drain the corn and add all to the pot and bring up to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Can hold longer over low heat.Serve with a sprinkle of cheese, chopped tomato, diced avocado, tortilla chips, green onion and a dollop of sour cream, or your own favorite toppings, if desired.Cook's Notes: This is the mix of beans and veggies that I use, but with a well stocked pantry, you can vary the recipe according to your own tastes, using a variety of substitutes. I also like to add in 1/2 pound of raw sausage such as breakfast, Italian sausage or bratwurst along with the ground beef. Swap the beef for ground turkey or use cooked, shredded chicken for a different twist.For the Crockpot: Brown the meat, drain and add it with remaining ingredients to the slow cooker. Cook on high for 3-4 hours, reduce and hold on low until needed. May also heat through on the stove, and transfer to the slow cooker to keep warm.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish",

Starting at the center of the dough, roll out, forming a 14-15-inch wide circle. Place the dough with parchment paper on a baking sheet. Brush the bottom of the dough with the apricot preserves. Arrange sliced pears in a spoke pattern on the galette dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the border over the pears, overlapping where necessary and pressing gently to adhere the folds.4.  Lightly brush the edge of the dough with the egg and sprinkle crust and pears with turbinado sugar.5. Bake the galette for 45-50 minutes, or until the pears are tender and the crust is golden brown. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.*Note-you can make the galette dough in advance. It will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days. Serve the pear galette with whipped cream or ice cream.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pear-galette-548603", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": ["mexican"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Taco-Salad-with-Ranch-Dressing-389485.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 389485, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Taco Salad with Ranch Dressing", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 184.96, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped black olives", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "black olives", "metaInformation": ["black", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-olives.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1059195, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken breast meat", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 5062, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon chili powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pound lettuce, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lettuce", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11252, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "monterey jack cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-white.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1001025, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 (8 ounce) bottle Ranch-style salad dressing", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "salad dressing", "metaInformation": ["ranch-style"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/italian-dressing.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 4114, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "3/4 (8 ounce) jar medium salsa", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "salsa", "metaInformation": ["medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salsa.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 6164, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001009, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup crushed tortilla chips", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "tortilla chips", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tortilla-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19056, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 70.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Taco-Salad-with-Ranch-Dressing/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Cook the chicken breasts in a medium skillet over medium high heat for 12 to 16 minutes, or until chicken is cooked though and juices run clear.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "id": 5062, "name": "chicken breast"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Let cool slightly then slice into strips.", "number": 2, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, chili powder, lettuce, salsa, dressing, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, olives and tortilla chips until evenly coated.

Remove the bacon and set aside; you'll add it back in when you serve your gumbo.2 Once the bacon is cooked, set the chicken thighs skin side down in the bacon fat to crisp. Salt the meat side, which will be facing up in the pot. Cook the chicken, without moving, for at least 4-5 minutes before trying to turn the chicken over. Brown the other side of the chicken thighs. Incidentally, you start with skin side down to render some fat, which you will need for the roux.3 Remove the browned chicken thighs and set aside. Brown the sausages in the fat, remove and set aside.4 If you want, measure how much fat is in the pot; it should be about 1/2 cup. Or, do what I do and add 1/2 cup peanut oil to the pot. Let this heat up a minute or two, then stir in 1 cup flour. Stir this almost constantly for the first few minutes, then every couple minutes or so thereafter. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook this roux until it turns dark. How dark? I like my roux the color of coffee with just a tiny bit of cream. You can go all the way to chocolate brown, but be careful! If you burn your roux you will need to start over and make it again. This whole process can take 30 minutes.5 While you are stirring and cooking the roux, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil in a separate pot.6 Add to the roux the onion, green pepper and celery and mix well. Let this cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, stir again and cook for another 2 minutes. Mix in the tomato paste.7 Using a large ladle, add the hot chicken stock to the gumbo. It will sizzle and seize up as the roux absorbs the liquid. Keep adding more stock, stirring all the time and scraping the bottom of the pot, to incorporate all the stock and all the roux.
