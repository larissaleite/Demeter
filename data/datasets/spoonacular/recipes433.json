Happy Baking.</p><p>I will address high altitude baking in depth at a later time...I just don't feel like it right now.</p><p>BYE!</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/banana-nut-bread-619543", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "dessert", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "How Sweet Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Upside-Down-Caramelized-Banana-Bread-Skillet-Cake-525701.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 525701, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Upside Down Caramelized Banana Bread Skillet Cake", "pricePerServing": 62.24, "creditText": "How Sweet Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 teaspoons baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "4 bananas, mashed (about 1 1/4 cups) + 2 bananas, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "bananas", "metaInformation": ["mashed", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 9040, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup loosely packed brown sugar + 1/3 cup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["loosely packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled + 3 tablespoons", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "cooled", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 44.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.howsweeteats.com/2012/07/upside-down-caramelized-banana-bread-skillet-cake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 28, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
