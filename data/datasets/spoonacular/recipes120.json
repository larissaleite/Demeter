To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some bigger pieces of butter. Add the ice water and pulse just until the crumbs begin to come together. Add a little more water if necessary but try not to add too much. Turn the mixture out onto a big sheet of plastic wrap, form it into a disc, wrap it and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to an even 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 16 to 20 circles. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you make the filling.For the filling: In a small saucepan, combine the peaches, granulated sugar and cornstarch. Bring to a boil over medium heat, mashing the peaches with a fork, and cook until the mixture has thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the bourbon to taste. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment, lay out half of the dough discs. Dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of each disc. Brush around the edges of the pastry with some of the egg mixture. Top with another dough disc, pressing the edges with a fork to seal. Brush the tops with the egg mixture and sprinkle with coarse sugar. With a paring knife, make a little slit in each pie to vent steam.Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the pies to a rack to cool or serve warm.

Crumble in the bouillon cube, and stir until dissolved. Add the sliced onions, then gently nestle the browned roast on top (it will probably look as if there isn\u2019t nearly enough liquid at this stage, but don\u2019t panic \u2013 the onions will eventually cook down and release their juices, creating the perfect roast-to-gravy ratio).Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours or until the beef is fork-tender, turning the roast over midway through the cooking process. Adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper to taste, then carve into slices across the grain and serve with a big mound of mashed potatoes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/moms-pot-roast-539344", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 20, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": ["chines", "asian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Shrimp-Fried-Rice-449984.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 449984, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Shrimp Fried Rice", "preparationMinutes": 20, "pricePerServing": 188.41, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "8 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled, optional", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon strips", "metaInformation": ["crumbled", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 10123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons butter, divided", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 cups cold cooked rice", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "cooked rice", "metaInformation": ["cold", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-uncooked.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 10220445, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs, lightly beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["lightly beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "shrimp", "metaInformation": ["medium", "deveined", "uncooked", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 15152, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 package (16 ounces) frozen mixed vegetables", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "stew vegetables", "metaInformation": ["mixed", "frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-vegetables.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 11583, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 58.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/shrimp-fried-rice", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "id": 1001, "name": "butter"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Pour eggs into skillet.

Prepare an 8 inch tart or pie pan with cooking spray.Place the pecans and dates in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped.  Add melted butter and process until a dough forms.  Press into your pan.  Bake for 8 \u2013 10 minutes until light golden brown. The crust will puff slightly. Let crust cool completely before filling.Gather and measure all of your ingredients before starting.  This is super important because you can\u2019t stop once you start the cooking process.You\u2019ll also need to gather your equipment and prepare an ice bath to cool down the pastry cream. (Just put some ice in a bowl large enough to fit the bowl you\u2019ll use to store your final product.) Other equipment you\u2019ll need: a whisk, a spatula, a four quart or larger stainless steel sauce pot or sauce pan, a clean bowl to store the final pastry cream, and plastic wrap.Put 12 ounces of milk and a pinch of salt into your sauce pan.  Bring to a boil, stirring with your spatula.  The milk will start to foam up so watch carefully.  If you don\u2019t pay attention you\u2019ll have a mess on your hands.  While the milk is coming to a boil, combine the remaining 4 ounces of milk and the cornstarch well with a whisk.  Add the eggs and vanilla to the milk mixture and whisk until combined.Once milk comes to a boil, temper the egg and milk mixture by pouring about one third of the boiling milk directly into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.  Don\u2019t stop whisking or your eggs will curdle.  Now, pour the tempered egg mix back into the milk, again, whisking constantly.  Brint this back to a boil while whisking.  Keep whisking.  Don\u2019t stop or your eggs will cook.As it comes to a boil, you\u2019re going to see it start to look like scrambled eggs.  Keep whisking.  Don\u2019t stop. The whisking keeps the eggs from scrambling. Once your mix thickens and comes to a boil, take it off the heat and immediately dump in the cubed butter while still whisking.  Don\u2019t stop until all the butter is melted into your pastry cream.  Add in agave and lemon zest.
