Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the 4 tablespoons cold butter into the flour until the pieces are pea size. Add the buttermilk to the flour mixture and, with your hands or a rubber spatula, stir just until the milk and flour come together to form a dough. Sprinkle some of the all-purpose flour on a work surface and place the dough on top of the flour. Using your hands, press the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick disk about 8-inches in diameter. Using a 3-inch round cutter dusted with flour, cut out dough rounds. Be sure to press straight down when cutting the dough (a twisting motion will prevent the dough from rising). You will need to reform the scraps of dough to make 8 biscuits. Do this by pushing the scrap pieces together and pressing them into a 1/2-inch-thick disk.Place the biscuits on a small sheet pan and brush the tops with the 2 tablespoons melted butter. Bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool briefly.

Knead with a dough hook, or   by hand on a lightly oiled surface. Knead until dough is smooth and silky- about 10 minutes. Add a little bit more flour as needed.   Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until puffy and almost doubled in size. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and shape it into a long, thin rectangle, about 16\" x 8\". To make the filling, combine the sugar, cinnamon, and flour in a small bowl. Brush the dough with some of the egg/water, and gently press the filling onto the dough. Beginning with a short edge, carefully roll the dough into a log. Pinch the side seam closed and place the log in a lightly greased loaf pan. Cover the pan with lightly oiled plastic wrap, and allow the bread to proof for about 1 hour at room temperature, or until it's about 1\" over the rim of the pan.In a small bowl combine the streusel ingredients, using your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients until crumbly. Brush the loaf with more of the remaining beaten egg, and add the streusel, using your fingers to gently apply it to the dough, being careful not to deflate the loaf. Bake the bread for about 45 minutes. If the loaf is browning too quickly after 30 minutes of baking tent the top of the loaf with foil for the last 15 mins of baking. Let the bread cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer the loaf to a cooling rack. I found tilting the pan to the side and using a butter knife to loosen it helped it pop right out without losing any streusel topping, but a little may fall off in the process.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/triple-cinnamon-swirl-bread-571008", "dishTypes": ["bread"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Beantown Baker", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Crockpot-Ham-with-Beer-and-Chutney-Glaze-509921.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 509921, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Crockpot Ham with Beer and Chutney Glaze", "pricePerServing": 143.35, "creditText": "Beantown Baker", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "24 ounces of beer", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "beer", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beer.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 14006, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 jar mango chutney", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "mango chutney", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mango-chutney.png", "unitLong": "jar", "unitShort": "jar", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10119297, "unit": "jar"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons spicy or Dijon-style mustard", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mustard", "metaInformation": ["spicy or dijon-style"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 2046, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 5 to 6 pound fully cooked, spiral cut ham", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "spiral ham", "metaInformation": ["fully cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ham-whole.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 5.0, "id": 10151, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 87.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.beantownbaker.com/2011/05/crockpot-ham-with-beer-and-chutney.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 20, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Trim off any excess fat.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg", "id": 404718, "name": "slow cooker"}], "step": "Place ham on a metal roasting rack or trivet in a 5-quart or larger crock pot or slow cooker.
