Line 10- by 15-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Sift flour, cocoa, and baking powder into small bowl; set aside.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Place chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 15 second increments, stopping to stir with a rubber spatula until completely melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. Alternatively, place butter and chocolate in a large bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until melted and smooth. Allow to cool slightly.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whip attachment, whip sugar with eggs and salt on medium-high speed until light and thick, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from mixer and fold in chocolate mixture with rubber spatula. Fold in flour mixture and then water until just combined.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Spread batter onto pan. Bake until just firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cake cool about 10 minutes. Run knife along inside pan edge to loosen cake.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Place clean kitchen towel over cake.

Gently unroll cake, removing towel but leaving very end rolled to ensure a good grip. Spread cream over exposed surface of cake. Carefully re-roll cake into log, removing parchment paper as you roll up. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap to keep cake in log shape as you prepare ganache.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Make the Ganache: In medium heat-proof bowl, heat chocolate with cream, stirring frequently, in microwave or over saucepan of barely simmering water until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Chill mixture until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Remove plastic wrap from cake and trim both ends of cake.

Make the salsa          In a small saucepan, boil the orange juice over medium heat until reduced to 1/4 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool.      In a medium bowl, combine the reduced orange juice, blood orange segments, onion, cilantro, olive oil, and orange zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper.        Cook the halibut          In a small bowl, mix the orange zest, thyme, 1-1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Rub the mixture all over the halibut fillets. Heat the oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, arrange the fillets in the pan. Sear for about 2 minutes without moving; then use a thin slotted metal spatula to lifta piece of fish and check the color. When the fillets are nicely browned, flip them and put the pan in the oven.      Roast until the halibut is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the halibut to serving plates. Spoon some of the salsa over each fillet.
