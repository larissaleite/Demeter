Add chicken broth and diced potatoes and bring mixture just to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, cover pot and cook 15 - 20 minutes until potatoes are very tender. In a mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups milk with 1/4 cup flour (whisk very well to break up flour) and pour mixture into soup. Increase temperature to medium high heat, and bring mixture just to a boil, stirring constantly (stirring constantly will help break down the potatoes a bit). Once mixture reaches a boil, reduce heat to low, add ranch dressing mixture from refrigerator, 1 cup (4 oz) grated Cheddar cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and season with black pepper to taste. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring frequently (note, if you want smaller potato chunks in the soup you can simply mash the soup with a potato masher to break them down a bit more). Serve warm, sprinkle each serving with remaining 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, chopped bacon, and chopped green onions. *you can use low sodium chicken broth if you prefer, for this recipe I just used regular and didn't add any salt to the soup.

Bake at 425\u00b0 for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.                                                                                           For filling, in a large saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, flour and salt. Gradually stir in water until smooth. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer.                                                                                            Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot filling into egg yolks; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Gently stir in butter and lemon peel. Gradually stir in lemon juice just until combined. Pour into the crust.                                                                                           For meringue, in a saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch. Gradually stir in cold water. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture is clear. Transfer to a bowl; cool.                                                                                           In a large bowl, beat egg whites and vanilla until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat in cornstarch mixture on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Spread evenly over hot filling, sealing edges to crust.                                                                                           Bake at 350\u00b0 for 25 minutes or until the meringue is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.                                        Yield: 6-8 servings.

Place over high heat, bring to a boil, and then lower to a simmer. Cook until very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well and place in a food processor. Add the olive oil, yogurt and salt. Puree until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.For the salmon: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with the salt. Place the fillets in the pan, flesh-side down, and sear undisturbed for 3 to 4 minutes to create a golden brown crust. Gently flip, and cook for another 2 minutes.Salad: In a small bowl, mix together the chopped fennel fronds and parsley and the crispy capers.To plate, spread a little of the fennel puree on each of 4 plates. Top with a salmon fillet. Place a little salad on top of each salmon. Squeeze a bit of lemon over the top if desired. Serve immediately.                                                Crispy Capers:                                        Heat 1/4-inch vegetable oil in a small, straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers when swirled. (You can make sure the oil is hot enough by adding one caper to the oil; if it immediately starts to sizzle and pop, the oil is hot enough.) Add the capers to the hot oil and fry until they have popped open and turned golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove the capers to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.

Remove from pan and place in between two paper towels set atop a dinner plate. Blot lightly and set aside. Drain most of the excess fat from the Dutch oven. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, squash, onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Saut\u00e9 over medium heat, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 8-10 minutes. Add the kale in batches as it fits in the pot, stirring so that it cooks down. Once kale has lightly wilted, add the tomatoes, 6 cups chicken stock, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to directions. Drain and set aside.Once soup has simmered and the vegetables are soft, discard the bay leaf. Add the beans, cooked pasta, and reserved bacon and heat through. The soup should be fairly thick, but add additional chicken stock as needed. Serve hot drizzled with olive oil and topped with Parmesan cheese.

Turn off the oven, tent the squash with foil and leave in the oven to keep warm.To prepare stuffing: Bring water, lentils and 1/8 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Adjust heat so the water is lightly boiling and cook until the lentils are not hard, but still maintain their shape, about 7 minutes. Drain, saving any lentil-cooking liquid; set lentils and liquid aside.Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.

Stir in tomatoes and 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid (if there isnt enough, make up the difference with water). Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the reserved lentils and simmer until they are soft and tender but not falling apart, 3 to 5 minutes. If the mixture seems dry, add more cooking liquid (or water). Stir in roasted peppers. Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Divide the lentil stuffing among the squash (a generous 1 cup per half).

Defrost, thoroughly wash and squeeze as much water out of the tofu as you can. See my post on \"vegetarian ground meat\" for more detailed instructions.Wash the quinoa and cook it in 1 cup of water. Add it to the bowl with the tofu when cooked. Boil the cabbage until it's not crisp anymore, but not until it's fully soft (about 1-2 minutes). Drain it and run under cold water so it's cool enough to handle. Shake out of the excess water but do not squeeze. Mince the cabbage and add it to the bowl with the tofu and quinoa. Add the scallions, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sake, potato starch, salt and white pepper to the bowl. Use a Microplane to grate the dried shiitake into a powder and add it to the bowl. Put on a food-safe glove and mix the filling with your hand, using a kneading action to coax the crumbly mixture to come together. It will never stick together like a meat-based filling, but it should hold its shape when scooped together with a spoon. If you're right handed, place 1 wrapper in the palm of your left hand, then place a spoonful of filling into the center of the wrapper. Dip the fingers of your right hand in a bowl of water, and wet the entire rim of the wrapper. This is what seals the pleats into place. Continue holding the dumpling in your left hand and fold the wrapper in half but don't seal the edges yet. Pinch the left edge shut and hold it shut with your left thumb and forefinger. Fold a pleat with your right thumb and forefinger. Pinch the pleat shut with your left thumb and forefinger. While using the fingers on your right hand to keep the filling from squeezing out. Continue pleating and pinching until you've reached the right edge. Repeat until you run out of filling or wrappers. If you're not going to fry them right away, put the dumplings on parchment paper and leave some space between each one to keep them from sticking. You can freeze them like this and transfer them to a freezer bag after they're frozen. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to non-stick frying pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the gyoza in rows. Fry until the gyoza are just starting to turn tan on the bottom. With a lid at the ready, add 1/4 cup of water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid. The oil is going to spatter quite a bit so be careful and use the lid as a shield to protect yourself. Let the gyoza steam for 2 minutes. If the water runs out before the 2 minutes are up, crack open the lid and add a little bit more. After steaming, remove the lid and let the remaining water burn off. Let the gyoza fry in the remaining oil until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy. Plate with the crispy side up so they don't get soggy. To make the sauce for the gyoza, combine equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar and add chili oil to taste.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/vegan-gyoza-196140", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 40, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Healthy Seasonal Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/whole-wheat-pretzels-524257.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 1380, "id": 524257, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "whole-wheat pretzels", "preparationMinutes": 60, "creditText": "Healthy Seasonal Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 tablespoons baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 18372, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd cups bread flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "bread flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10120129, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon softened butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "coarse salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "coarse salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg, beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large", "beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "generous pinch instant yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "instant yeast", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10118375, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon barley malt syrup", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "rice malt syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93784, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd teaspoons salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "seeds", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sunflower-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 93818, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bc cup room temperature water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": ["room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "12 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 12.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00be cups (7 \u00bc ounces) white whole-wheat flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white flour", "metaInformation": ["whole-wheat", "white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 7.25, "id": 20081, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "yeast", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18375, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 33.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.healthyseasonalrecipes.com/whole-wheat-soft-pretzels/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "aggregateLikes": 219, "instructions": "Make Preferment: Whisk white whole-wheat flour, water and pinch of yeast in a large bowl.

Make Dough: Stir bread flour, softened butter, salt, 1 teaspoon yeast, and barley syrup into the preferment until it is too difficult to work with a spoon, and then work with hands in the bowl until the dough comes together in a sticky mass. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until the ball of dough is smooth and elastic. (Do not mix in extra flour. The dough will seem a little tacky at first, but will improve in texture as you work it.) Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with plastic and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Prepare Water Bath: Bring water and baking soda to a boil in a large flame-proof roasting pan, or large wide pot. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Meanwhile, turn-out dough onto a lightly floured surface, and flatten and cut into 8 equal pieces, about 3 \u00bd ounces each. See photos for snake technique. Roll each dough into long even ropes, about 22-inches long. Shape into pretzel by forming a loop at the bottom and then twisting the top over one time. Wrap the tails down to the opposite bottom side and press them down to adhere. Transfer four pretzels to the boiling baking soda bath and allow to blanch until they are puffed up, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the pretzels to a clean dish towel to drain off the excess moisture before transferring them to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second batch, making sure that the water comes to a boil again before adding them to the bath.  Top Pretzels: Brush all of the pretzels with the egg using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the coarse salt and seeds over the pretzels.

"instructions": "Directions                                                        For the dough: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter, and pulse until the mixture resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of butter. Add the egg, and pulse until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is very dry, add up to 1 tablespoon cold water.) Remove the dough, gently pat it into a round, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.For the filling: Meanwhile, put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel and core the apples; cut each in half, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the apples and granulated sugar to the bowl with the lemon juice, and toss.Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the sugared apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes.Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to extract as much liquid as possible. Return the juice to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until it has thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.Toss the apples with the thickened juice, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Set aside to cool completely. (The cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months.)For the streusel topping: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the butter, and rub it into the flour mixture with your fingers until it has been absorbed. Mix in the walnuts.To assemble and bake the pie: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven, place a baking sheet on it and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough disk into a 12-inch circle. Layer it between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.Ease the dough round into a 9-inch pie pan. Fold and crimp the edges as desired. Add the filling, and spread it out to make an even layer. Squeeze handfuls of the streusel topping, and drop clumps of it on top of the filling to completely cover it.Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust and streusel are golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Let it cool on a cooling rack for at least 3 hours before serving. (The pie keeps well, covered, at room temperature for 24 hours or refrigerated for up to 4 days.)Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Heat the milk and the butter until warm. (Butter does not need to completely melt.)Combine the warm milk mixture, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add in the egg, yeast mixture and 1 cup of the flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Gradually add more flour until you have a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once, then cover and let it rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled, about 1 hour.Punch the dough down and let it rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a 12x15-inch rectangle. Spread the butter on top of the dough. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, cherries and chocolate chips. Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough. Roll up jellyroll style. Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray.

While the dough is chilling, proceed with the filling (recipe below).Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between 2 pieces of parchment paper, working from the middle out, until it is large enough to fit into a 7- or 8-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.Carefully transfer the dough to the tart pan and gently press it down to fit, filling cracks where needed. Be sure the dough is not thicker where the sides and bottom meet. Trim any excess dough on the rim. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.Evenly spread the toasted peanuts over the bottom of the tart and spoon the filling over top, making sure all the peanuts are covered in the filling.Bake the tart at 300 degrees on the bottom rack of the oven for about 25 minutes, or until the filling starts to bubble and the crust is light golden. Remove the tart from the oven and allow it to cool completely. Return the tart to the fridge for 2 to 3 hours to firm up before topping with chocolate ganache (recipe below). Place the tart back in the fridge to allow the chocolate to firm up before serving. Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer, covered with plastic wrap.In a medium bowl, stir together the brown rice syrup, peanut butter, agave nectar, flax meal and vanilla until smooth.In a small bowl, whisk together the arrowroot and almond milk until the arrowroot is dissolved.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees with a rack in the middle of the oven.  Lightly coat 2 (9-inch) cake pans with nonstick vegetable spray.  Line the bottoms with a circle of baking parchment.Into a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt together, 3 times.  In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a boil.  Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and lemon extracts.  In separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until pale yellow, and fluffy, and doubled in volume.  While still beating, drizzle in the hot milk mixture.  Fold in the flour mixture.  Spread the batter in the prepared pans and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden, the center springs back when lightly pressed, and a cake tester comes out clean.  Set the pans on a rack to cool.  Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the cakes to loosen them, and turn them out of the pans.Whipped Cream Frosting: In a medium bowl, mix together the gelatin and 1/4 cup of the cream.  Let rest for 5 minutes to soften, then place the bowl over barely simmering water until the gelatin has completely dissolved.  Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool to tepid.  In the meantime, in a mixing bowl, whip the cream until slightly thickened.  Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla and whip to the consistency of shaving cream.  Fold 1/2 cup of the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture, then fold in the rest.Wash and dry the strawberries.  Pick out the 12 best.  Stem and slice the rest.  Lay the sliced berries over 1 cake, then spread a 1/2-inch layer of whipped cream on top.  Place the second cake over the first.  Frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.  Top with the 12 whole berries.

Stuff the cavity with the thyme sprigs, garlic, and one lemon half, squeezing the lemon as you insert it to release the juice into the cavity. Rub the butter all over the chicken skin, including undersides, then season once again with salt and pepper.Tie the ends of the drumsticks together with twine. Arrange the chicken breast-up on the rack in a roasting pan. Squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon half over the top of the chicken. (You can toss the lemon half into the roasting pan or discard it.)Place the roasting pan in the oven. After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F. When the chicken is beginning to brown rapidly, baste with accumulated pan juices.Add the onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf to the roasting pan after 30 minutes. Continue roasting, basting several times, until the juices run clear when pierced at the thickest part of the thigh with a knife or if you tilt the chicken forward the juices that run out of the cavity are clear, an additional 45 to 60 minutes (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours total roasting time). Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest in a warm place to allow the juices to redistribute, about 15 minutes. To serve, remove the herbs and the lemon half from the cavity and discard. Reserve the garlic cloves and carve the chicken. Serve the chicken with the vegetables and reserved garlic cloves. (The bay leaf may be left for decoration or discarded.)
