Add half the onions and celery, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Top with the remaining onions and celery, 1/2 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper, the bay leaves and the thyme sprigs. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until all the liquid evaporates and the onions are very soft and golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. (If the onions are soft but could be more golden, increase the heat slightly for a few minutes toward the end of cooking.)Add the flour, and stir until completely absorbed, about 1 minute. Add the broth and wine, and simmer until almost completely evaporated, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool for a few minutes. Remove the bay leaves and thyme stems. (The onions can be made, cooled and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead.)Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the baguette slices on a baking sheet until they're slightly toasted but not golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Let cool.Shingle and slightly overlap half the bread slices in a 3-quart baking dish. Top with the onion mixture in 1 layer. Shingle, overlapping, with the remaining bread. Sprinkle the Gruyere over the top. Cover with foil, and bake until the onion mixture is hot and the cheese is melted, about 40 minutes. Remove the foil, switch the oven from bake to broil and broil until the top is golden in spots. Sprinkle the thyme leaves over the top. Serve hot.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Stir in the flour until no dry streaks of flour remain.Cover the dough and set aside in a warm area to proof for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in volume. Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled, or for up to 1 week (see Note 1).When you are ready to make pizzas, preheat the oven to 550\u00b0F with a baking stone on the middle rack for at least 30 minutes. Have cornmeal and a pizza peel handy nearby for when you stretch the dough.Divide the dough in half and place the dough balls on a well-floured surface. Allow the dough to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. The dough should feel soft and pillowy.While the dough comes to room temperature and starts to come alive, prep the topping ingredients so they will be handy nearby after you stretch the dough.\u00a0Liberally sprinkle corn meal on the pizza peel. Set nearby while you stretch the dough.When the dough feels soft and pillowy, with floured hands, lightly flour the first dough ball. Using your fingertips, make indentations just inside the outer edge to form the outer crust rim (see photo in post). Using your hands, rotate and gently press out the dough, working from the center outward to flatten it, leaving the outer rim as untouched as possible. Gently push out to a circle 6 - 8 inches in diameter.Resting the dough on the tops of your hands, \u00a0rotate and circle the dough over the tops of your hands, gently stretching the dough to about 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter. Make sure to keep the rim thicker than the center.\u00a0(If the dough starts to toughen and spring back too much while you work on it, allow it to rest for a few minutes so it will relax and soften.) Lightly re-flour your hands, the work surface, and the dough as needed to keep the dough from sticking.Lay the stretched out dough on the prepared pizza peel. Give it a little shake to make sure the dough isn't sticking to the peel. Gently brush oil on the outer crust. Shake the peel again to make sure nothing is sticking.Gently ladle and spread 1/2 of the sauce on the dough. Spread 1/2 of the turkey on the pizza, spread 1/2 of the cheese, and season with additional salt and pepper if desired.Bake for 10-13 minutes or until the crust is golden or even slightly charred if you like. While the first pizza is baking, repeat the stretching and topping instructions with the second pizza.Allow each pizza to cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bbq-turkey-pizza-with-your-leftover-thanksgiving-turkey-590122", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Betty Crocker", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Senate-Bean-Soup-171117.ashx", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 255, "id": 171117, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Senate Bean Soup", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Betty Crocker", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 medium stalks celery, chopped (1 cup)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "celery", "metaInformation": ["medium", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11143, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups dried navy beans (1 lb), sorted and rinsed", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "dried navy beans", "metaInformation": ["dried", "rinsed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 16037, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "1 clove garlic, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "1 ham bone, 2 lb ham shanks or 2 lb smoked pork hocks", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "ham bone", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bone-ham.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12011111, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 large onion, chopped (1 cup)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["large", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 cups mashed potatoes", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potatoes", "metaInformation": ["mashed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 11362, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "12 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 12.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "ashx", "spoonacularScore": 97.0, "sourceUrl": "https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/senate-bean-soup/d52e6a22-8bd0-41ae-ab47-335d3f83b56d", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 28, "instructions": "1                               In 4-quart Dutch oven, heat beans and water to boiling.

"aggregateLikes": 1018, "instructions": "Make the filling1. Whisk the yolks in a medium saucepan off the stove. Gradually whisk in the evaporated milk. Add the sugars, butter, and salt and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is boiling, frothy, and slightly thickened, about 6 minutes.2. Pour the mixture into a bowl, whisk in the vanilla, then stir in the coconut. Let cool until just warm. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. (Do not add the pecans now or they\u2019ll turn soggy. Have a little patience, my friend.)Make the cake3. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position. Combine the chocolate and cocoa in a small bowl and then add the boiling water over. Let stand to melt the chocolate, about 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth and let stand until room temperature.4. Meanwhile, spray two 9-inch-round by 2-inch-high straight-sided cake pans with nonstick cooking spray and then line the bottoms with parchment or waxed paper rounds cut to fit. Spray the paper rounds, dust the pans with flour, and tap out any excess flour. Sift the flour and baking soda into a medium bowl or onto a sheet of parchment or waxed paper.5. In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat the butter, sugars, and salt at medium-low speed until the sugar is moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula halfway through. With the mixer running at medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl halfway through. Beat in the vanilla, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 45 seconds. With the mixer running at low speed, add the chocolate mixture, then increase the speed to medium and beat until combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl once. (The batter may appear broken; this is okay.) With the mixer running at low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Beat in each addition until barely combined. After adding the final flour addition, beat on low until just combined, then stir the batter by hand with a rubber spatula, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl. The batter will be thick. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, spreading the batter to the edges of the pans with the rubber spatula and smoothing the surface.6. Bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 minutes, then invert the cakes onto a greased wire rack; peel off and discard the paper rounds. Cool the cakes to room temperature before filling, about 1 hour. (The cooled cakes can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 1 day.)Assemble the cake7. Stir the toasted pecans into the chilled filling. Set one cake on a serving platter or cardboard round cut slightly smaller than the cake, and the second cake on a work surface (or leave it on the wire rack). With a serrated knife held so that the blade is parallel with the work surface, use a sawing motion to cut each cake into two even layers. Starting with the first cake, carefully lift off the top layer and set aside.8. Using an icing spatula, distribute about 1 cup filling evenly on the cake, spreading the filling to the very edge of the cake and leveling the surface. Carefully place the upper cake layer on top of the filling; repeat using the remaining filling and cake layers. Dust any crumbs off the platter and serve. (The cake may be refrigerated, covered loosely with foil, up to 4 hours. If the cake has been refrigerated longer than 2 hours, let it stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving.)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/german-chocolate-cake-596879", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 90, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eat Good 4 Life", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Dark-chocolate-and-banana-No-bake-granola-553291.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 553291, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Dark chocolate and banana No bake granola", "creditText": "Eat Good 4 Life", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 1/2 cup chopped dried banana chips", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "banana chips", "metaInformation": ["dried", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/banana-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19400, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups brown rice cereal", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "brown rice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-brown-cooked.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20040, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chia seeds", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "chia seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chia-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 12006, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup coconut chips, optional", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12108, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup coconut oil", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 4047, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dark chocolate chips", "metaInformation": ["dark"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10019071, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup flax seed meal", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flax seed meal", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flax-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 12220, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19296, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup organic peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["organic"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 16098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cup roasted unsalted peanuts", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "roasted peanuts", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanuts.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 16092, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 cups steel cut oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "steel cut oats", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/steel-cut-oats.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 93695, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 37.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.eatgood4life.com/dark-chocolate-and-banana-no-bake-granola/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 46, "instructions": "In a medium sauce pan, add peanut butter, oil and honey.

whisk together the rice flour, tapioca flour, potato starch, xanthan gum and salt.For the puffs: In a small bowl, whisk the granulated sugar, cinnamon and salt together with 1 cup gluten-free flour blend.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter together with the milk and 1/2 cup water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the flour mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir the dough until a ball forms, about 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a food processor and pulse about 20 times to cool. With the motor running, stream in the eggs, egg white and baking powder; process until a smooth dough forms. Using a 1 1/2-inch ice cream scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet; bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut a slit on the sides of each to vent and let cool completely.For the filling: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream at high speed until soft peaks start to form. Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and spice and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Fold in the pumpkin puree. Cut the puffs in half and using an ice cream scoop, place mounds of whipped pumpkin cream on the puff bottoms. Set the tops in place and dust with confectioners' sugar.

   To make the dressing: Combine 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the vinegar and the brown sugar in a small skillet and cook over medium heat. Stir and cook until the mixture turns a dark caramel color and begins to thicken. You will start to see big foamy bubbles on the surface. Add the apples and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Remove from the heat and put in a blender, along with the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, the thyme, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Whoosh until blended. Then, with the motor running, slowly add the oil, blending until the dressing is emulsified. Taste and season with salt and perhaps a splash more vinegar.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, make the salad: Cook the lardons in a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Drain on a paper towel.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Combine the lardons and the remaining salad ingredients in a large bowl.

Prepare the Biga: Combine the bread flour, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature overnight (at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours).2. Prepare the Soaker: Combine the whole-wheat flour, wheat germ and milk in a large bowl and stir with wooden spoon until a shaggy mass forms, about 1 minute. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Return soaker to the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours).3. Prepare the Dough: Tear the soaker into 1-inch pieces and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the biga, honey, salt, yeast, butter and oil. Mix on low speed until a cohesive mass starts to form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead for 1 minute. The dough will be very soft and slack. Transfer the dough to a large clean, lightly greased bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature for 45 minutes.4. Lightly flour your fingertips. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Holding the edge of the dough with your fingertips, fold the dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward the middle. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and fold again. Turn the bowl and fold the dough 6 more times (for a total of 8 folds). Cover and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.5. Adjust the oven racks to middle and lowest positions, place a baking stone on the middle rack, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with non-stick cooking spray. Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and divide into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, pat each into an 8x17-inch rectangle. With the short side facing you, roll the dough toward you into firm cylinder, keeping the roll taut by tucking it under itself as you go. Turn the loaf seam side up and pinch it closed. Place the loaf seam side down in the prepared loaf pan, pressing it gently into the corners. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the loaves loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes (the top of the loaves should rise about 1 inch above the edge of the pan).6. Place an empty baking pan (not glass!) on the bottom oven rack and bring 2 cups of water to boil on the stove. Using a sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make one \u00bc-inch-deep slash lengthwise down the center of each loaf. Pour the boiling water into the empty loaf pan on the bottom rack and place the loaves on the baking stone. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees (177 degrees C). Bake until the crust is dark brown and the internal temperature registers 200 degrees F (93 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the loaves 180 degrees and side to side halfway through baking.7. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans, return to the wire rack, and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. The bread should be double-wrapped in plastic wrapped and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. The loaf can be wrapped with an additional layer of aluminum foil and frozen for up to 1 month.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/whole-wheat-sandwich-bread-609771", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 2220, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lifes Ambrosia", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Coconut-Prawns-567626.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 567626, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Coconut Prawns", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Lifes Ambrosia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/3 cup all purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "all purpose flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup flaked coconut", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "coconut", "metaInformation": ["flaked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12104, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 egg whites, beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": ["beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1022020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1082047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "oil for frying", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": ["for frying"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "panko bread crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/panko.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10018079, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "15 (26 - 30 count) prawns, peeled, deveined, tail-on if possible", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "prawns", "metaInformation": ["deveined", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 390.0, "id": 15152, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 85.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2010/05/coconut-prawns-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 25, "aggregateLikes": 11, "instructions": "Using a small knife cut the prawns down the back, but do not cut through.

Combine fruit/nut mixture with creamed ingredients and mix well to distribute the fruit and nuts evenly. 4 Pour batter into a prepared loaf pan (see note) and bake at 325\u00b0F for one and a half to two hours or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.  Place a pan of water in the oven when the cake goes in.  Water may need to be replenished during baking.5 Wrap tightly with aluminum foil and plastic wrap to store.  If you want, you can sprinkle on a few ounces of Bourbon, especially if you would like to store the fruit cake for a while.Note:  Line the loaf pan with greased parchment paper or brown baking paper, cut to fit the pan.  Place one piece to run the length of the pan and stand up above the rim about an inch.  Place the other piece or pieces to cover the other sides.  When the cake comes out of the oven, you can easily remove it by holding the sides of the paper and lifting the cake out of the pan.  Once the cake has cooled completely, you can pull off the paper.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/patricias-holiday-fruitcake-247160", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foxes Love Lemons", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Seared-Chilean-Sea-Bass-with-Potatoes---Herb-Sauce-512095.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 7, "id": 512095, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Seared Chilean Sea Bass with Potatoes & Herb Sauce", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Foxes Love Lemons", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 celery stalks, roughly chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "celery stalks", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11143, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 pieces (4 ounces each) Chilean sea bass", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "chilean sea bass", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 16.0, "id": 93804, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "Cilantro sprigs for garnish", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cilantro", "metaInformation": ["for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "sprig", "unitShort": "sprigs", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "sprigs"}, {"originalString": "1 pound small fingerling potatoes", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "fingerling potatoes", "metaInformation": ["small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fingerling-potatoes.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10111352, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "2 cups packed fresh cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh cilantro", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup Greek yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "greek yogurt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1256, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9152, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Pinch of kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 leek (dark green top only), roughly chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "leek", "metaInformation": ["dark", "green", "roughly chopped", "( top only)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/leeks.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11246, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "8 scallions, trimmed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["trimmed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 11291, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 91.0, "sourceUrl": "http://foxeslovelemons.com/seared-chilean-sea-bass-potatoes-herb-sauce/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "aggregateLikes": 273, "instructions": "Make the Green Sauce: Puree all ingredients in blender until smooth.
