Cut the asparagus into 2-1/2-in. pieces. Set tips aside; cut remaining pieces in half. Cook all of the asparagus in a small amount of water until crisp-tender, about 3-4 minutes; drain.                                                                                            In a bowl, combine the cream cheese and egg yolk; gradually add cream (mixture will be slightly lumpy). Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add salt and pepper. Place ham and asparagus pieces (not tips) over crust; pour half of the cream cheese mixture over the top. Bake at 425\u00b0 for 15 minutes.                                                                                            Pour remaining cream cheese mixture over top. Arrange asparagus tips over tart; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375\u00b0 for 40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.                                        Yield: 6-8 servings.
