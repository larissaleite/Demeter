Next, beat in the melted chocolate, scrape down the sides, and then turn the mixer back on low and slowly add in the whipping cream. Once all the cream is added, turn mixer up to high and beat for a minute, frosting should be light and fluffy. To assemble your cake, place the first layer on a cake stand and spread some frosting over the top, then add the next layer and spread the top of that one with some frosting.

boil. Add the haricots verts; cook until crisp-tender, 4 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon each butter and parsley; season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.Meanwhile, season the pork with salt and pepper and rub with the thyme. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until browned and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; tent with foil and let rest.Wipe out the skillet; add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the cider and prunes; cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the heavy cream and cook until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley. Serve the pork with the apple cream sauce and haricots verts.Photograph by Justin Walker                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

For dairy-free vegan biscuits, use margarine or shortening and dairy-free milk in the biscuit dough, then brush with margarine.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in a large bowl. If you have extra time, chill dry ingredients in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before proceeding. If not, that's ok-- cold ingredients provide a better result, but it's not a requirement here. Add frozen butter, margarine or shortening to the bowl cut into small pieces. Use a pastry cutter or fork to combine the dry ingredients with the fat until only small pieces remain and it looks like sand.Whisk together milk or non-dairy milk with lemon juice.Make a well in the dry ingredients. Stir gently while pouring in the milk mixture 1/3 cup at a time. You may not need all of the liquid.Stir until just slightly combined, the mixture will be sticky.Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with a bit of flour and then fold the dough over on itself 4-5 times. Resist the urge to knead the dough, it will result in dense biscuits. Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible.Use a 2-inch biscuit or cookie cutter and push straight down through the dough, then slightly twist to cut out as many biscuits as possible.Place biscuits on a greased baking sheet in two rows, making sure they just touch along the edges. This will help them rise uniformly. Gently reform the remaining dough and cut out one or two more biscuits. You should end up with 7-8 biscuits total. Gently press a small divot in the center of each biscuit with your thumb (again, helps them rise uniformly).Brush biscuits with the 2 T. melted butter or margarine.Bake in the 450 degree oven for 20 minutes or until fluffy and golden, rotating the pan halfway through baking.

Stir in the orange zest and sugar and whisk until frothy, about 2 minutes. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl, then use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture together until a smooth dough forms. The dough will be sticky. Cover the bowl and set aside to rest for 1 hour.To make the syrup, heat the lemon juice, sugar, and water in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Stir in the honey and orange zest and simmer for an additional five minutes. Turn heat down as low as possible, and just keep glaze warm while you fry the cakes.To finish the cakes, sprinkle a small amount of flour on a clean countertop or piece of parchment paper. Add the dough to the floured surface, flour your hands, and then work in just enough additional flour to keep the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to about \u00bc inch thick. It doesn\u2019t need to be in any particular shape. If the dough keeps \u201cjumping back,\u201d give it a few minutes to rest before trying to roll again. Use a 2 inch round biscuit cutter to cut out round cakes.Pour vegetable oil in a deep pot to about 3-4 inches high. Heat the oil to 325-350 degrees. Drop the cake rounds into the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time, frying until golden brown or about 1-2 minutes per side. Remove hot cakes and place them on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Don\u2019t worry if the cakes don\u2019t stay perfectly round when you drop them in the skillet\u2013they\u2019ll puff up and be just fine.Drop several cakes at a time into the glaze and let them sit for 15-30 seconds to let it soak in, then remove to a platter. I like these best served warm. You can also drizzle any additional glaze over the top of the cakes once you\u2019re finished.

Push the power button and do not move the blender for a full 20 seconds. This will cause your dressing to emulsify and become lusciously thick and creamy. After 20 seconds, start moving your blender around and up and down just to make sure that every last bit gets well incorporated. Set asideAdd the cashew pieces, garlic and salt to a small food processor and give them a few quick pulses until their texture resembles that of grated parmesan. Set aside.Melt the ghee in a skillet that\u2019s been set over medium-high heat. Cut the Faux\u2019caccia into large dice and throw them right into the hot fat. Let them brown for about 30 seconds then flip them to another side. Repeat until all sides are nice and golden and crispy. Kill the heat and set asideAdd the lettuce, endive, avocado and dressing to a large mixing bowl. Toss to combine.
