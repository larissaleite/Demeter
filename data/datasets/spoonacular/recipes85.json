Add the grated cheese and mix well again. Divide the mixture equally into sixths, then shape into 6 round patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Place on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan in the refrigerator to chill, for at least 15 minutes, or up to a day ahead.Make the burger spread: Stir together the mayo, mustard, Sriracha, capers, paprika, cumin, salt and pepper in a small mixing bowl until well combined. Refrigerate until ready to use. May be made up to a week in advance.Cook the patties: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add just enough olive oil to lightly coat the pan. Working in batches (as needed), saute the patties, 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Wait to flip the first time until a good sear has formed, around the 4-minute mark.Place one or two slices of cheese on top of each patty, turn the heat down to medium-low, cover (I use an extra-large, clear skillet lid), and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes until the cheese is melted.Assemble the burgers: Grill or lightly toast the hamburger buns. Spread the burger sauce over bottom buns, top with lettuce, veggie patties, and any desired toppings.

Bubble for a min until everything is just starting to soften, then tip onto a plate and leave tocool slightly.Use a serrated knife to trim away the pastry and make a neat edge. Dust the tart lightly with icing sugar, then use a blowtorch to caramelise the top. Leave the top to set, then repeat the process so that you get an extra-thick layer of caramel.

Transfer to a colander and toss with 3/4 teaspoon salt; let drain in the sink, tossing occasionally, about 30 minutes. Rinse well and pat dry. Meanwhile, peel the tomatoes using a sharp vegetable peeler, then halve horizontally and squeeze out the seeds. Puree 1 tomato with the olive oil, garlic, jalapeno, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a food processor or blender. Transfer to a bowl. Chop the remaining 4 tomatoes and add to the bowl; add the pine nuts, basil, oregano, and salt to taste. Divide the zucchini among bowls and top with the tomato sauce.

Cook 15 minutes, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon, until the onions start to caramelize. Turn the heat down to low and continue to cook, about 10 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are a deep golden brown. Remove from the heat and set aside.5. Meanwhile, use a mandoline to slice the potatoes into 1/16-inch-thick rounds. Pour 1/2 cup cream evenly onto the bottom of a 9-by-9-inch (or equivalent) gratin dish. Place one layer of potatoes side by side, slightly overlapping, on the bottom of the dish. Spread a third of the onions over them and scatter a third of the bacon on top. Arrange a second layer of potatoes, drizzle 1/4 cup cream over it, and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, a healthy pinch of pepper, and 1 teaspoon thyme. Press the potatoes down with your fingers, letting the cream soak up through the layers. This will ensure that the cream is evenly distributed and coats the potatoes well.6. Arrange another layer of potatoes on top, followed by another third of the caramelized onions and the bacon. Drizzle over another 1/4 cup cream and continue with two more layers of potatoes. Drizzle with 1/2 cup cream and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Press the potatoes down with your fingers again. Scatter the rest of the onions and bacon over the potatoes and drizzle with 1/3 cup cream. Season one last time with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon thyme, and a pinch of pepper. The cream should cover the potatoes but not be soupy. Add more cream if the gratin seems dry.7. Cover tightly with plastic wrap (yes, it can go in the oven) and then foil. Bake 1 1/2 hours, until the potatoes are tender when pierced. Remove from the oven and carefully uncover. Turn the oven up to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) and return the gratin to the oven. Cook another 20 minutes or so, until the top is nice and golden brown, as in gratin\u00e9ed. Let rest at room temperature. Increase the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).Make the grilled duck breasts8. Pound the juniper berries in a mortar until coarsely ground. Score the skin of the duck breasts with a sharp knife and season with the jumper berries and the thyme. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.9. Light the grill 30 to 40 minutes before cooking and remove the duck from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature.10. Using scissors, snip the grapes into 6 clusters. Toss the clusters gently with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast the grapes on a baking sheet 12 to 15 minutes, until the skin is slightly crisp and starting to blister.11. When the coals are broken down, red, and glowing, push the embers to one side of the grill.12. Season the duck with salt and pepper. Place the duck breasts, skin side down, on the cooler half of the grill. As they cook, rotate the breasts in a quarter-turn pattern every 2 minutes or so, to allow the fat to render and the skin to crisp. Turn the breasts over and cook a few more minutes, until the duck is medium-rare and still springy to the touch.13. Remove from the heat and rest 5 minutes on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.14. Scatter the greens onto a large warm platter. Slice the duck breasts and place them over the greens. Spoon a little cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche over each duck breast and arrange the clusters of roasted grapes around the platter.

Add the date pur\u00e9e and the flour mixture, alternating, to the butter mixture, and combine well.                                                                 Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes, until the pudding is dark brown. Immediately after removing the pudding from the oven, pour 1/2 cup of toffee sauce over the top. Let the pudding rest for 15 minutes before serving.                                                                While the pudding is baking, cut the stem and blossom ends from the blood oranges. Place the oranges cut-side down on a cutting board. Following the contour of the fruit with your knife, remove the peel and cottony white pith, working from top to bottom, and rotating the fruit as you go. Slice each orange into 8 to 10 pinwheels.                                                                 Peel the tangerines, separate them into segments, and remove all the white veins, or pith. Slice the kumquats into pinwheels. Chill the fruit until you are ready to serve.                                                                Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or by hand), whip the cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche together to soft peaks.                                                                 Slice six pieces of warm pudding (the pudding serves twelve) and place them on six dessert plates. Spoon the rest of the warm toffee sauce over the slices. On each plate, dollop a heaping tablespoon of the whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche next to each piece and arrange the citrus evenly over and around the pudding. Scatter the kumquats in a beautiful natural style.                                                            The toffee-cake itself is soft and mellow in flavor, with a delicate gingerlike spiciness. This makes for the ideal foundation from which the citrus ingredients can shine, and sets up the inspiration for my wine pairing. I want the wine to reflect the citrus notes in the dessert, so I opt for Muscat, like the elegant Muscat du Cap Corse from the island of Corsica. This wine has a bright marmaladelike quality of preserved orange and mandarin that mimics the fruit flavors in the recipe, allowing them to flow seamlessly from one to another on the palate.

Bake blind for twelve to fifteen minutes, until the pastry is pale golden and dry to the touch.\u00a0                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Decrease the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Bring a large pan of water to a boil, drop in the asparagus, and let it simmer for seven or eight minutes or so, until it is quite tender. It will receive more cooking later but you want it to be thoroughly soft after its time in the oven, as its texture will barely change later under the custard.\u00a0                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Put the cream in a pitcher or bowl and beat in the eggs gently with a fork. Coarsely chop the tarragon and add that to the cream with a seasoning of salt and black pepper. Slice the asparagus into short lengths, removing any tough ends. Scatter it over the partly baked pastry shell, then pour in the cream and egg mixture and scatter the cheese over the surface. Bake for about forty minutes, until the filling is golden and set.

Keep warm while you are preparing the recipe, do not let boil.3 Put 2 quarts of water, salted with 1 Tbsp salt, into a large pot and heat to a boil.  Once the water is at a full boil, add the macaroni to the pot.  Return to a boil, and cook, uncovered, for about 2 minutes less than the macaroni package specifies, so that it is al dente, cooked, but still firm to the bite.4 While the water is heating and the macaroni cooking, prepare the chorizo cheese sauce.  Remove chorizo from its casing and put into a medium thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat.  When the chorizo begins to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium.  Cook the chorizo, stirring often, for 2 minutes.  Add the minced red onion and cook the mixture until the onions soften, about 3-4 minutes.5 When the macaroni is cooked, but still a bit firm, drain it and set aside.  Preheat oven to 375\u00b0.6 Add the flour to the pot with the chorizo and mix well. Everything will clump up. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pot, for 2 minutes. Add the hot milk a tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly. When all the milk has been added, heat the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes.7 Mix the grated cheese into the chorizo milk sauce.  Mix in the cooked macaroni into the chorizo cheese sauce.  Stir in the lime juice. Pour the macaroni and cheese into a small casserole dish. Make sure the top is level.

baking dish with a thin coat of softened butter and sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the surface. Set the salmon fillets upright (flat-side down) on the baking dish, brush a little soft butter over each fillet and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.In a small bowl, whisk the pesto, mustard and lemon juice together and season it with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture evenly over the salmon, covering the top surface only. Bake until the desired doneness, 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare for 1 1/2-inch-thick fillets (cook longer for thicker pieces).For the salad: Meanwhile, put the cucumber into a clean towel on a cutting board and smash it with the heel of your hand. Unwrap the cucumber and slice it crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces; transfer them to a mixing bowl and sprinkle a little salt over them. Add the dates and apples and stir to mix. Add the pine nuts, olive oil, mint and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, and toss until evenly combined.Serve the salmon fillets on warm plates with the salad on the side.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a small bowl, pour the bourbon or apple juice over the raisins and microwave on high for 45 seconds. Let sit for 15 minutes.Combine the raisins, apples, lemon juice, lemon zest, cinnamon, brown sugar, cookie crumbs, pecans, and butter in a large bowl.Remove the phyllo dough from the box, unfold, and cover with a damp towel. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the work surface and brush lightly with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining sheets, brushing each with melted butter, stacking when done, being sure to keep the unbuttered phyllo covered.Place the apple mixture on the nearest third of the phyllo stack, being sure to leave a 2-inch border. Gently lift the bottom edge of the phyllo stack to cover the filling and fold the side edges over. Continue to roll the stack away from you until the filling is completely sealed in and the seam is on the bottom. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle with granulated sugar.Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown. Pour over the glaze and sprinkle with cinnamon and confectioners' sugar.
