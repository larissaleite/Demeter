The bacon will continue to cook on the pizza. Remove the bacon and place on a paper-towel lined plate to drain. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble into small pieces.In a conventional oven, place an oven rack on the highest level directly under the broiler, and turn the broiler to high.Cut the cherry tomatoes in half, drizzle with a few teaspoons of olive oil, and spread out in an even layer on a non-stick or parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Broil for 8-10 minutes, until the tomatoes start to blister and crinkle. Remove from the oven and set aside. Keep the broiler on.While the tomatoes are cooking, heat a dry 9-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat for 10 minutes. If the skillet begins to smoke, turn the heat down, but the goal is to get the skillet as hot as possible.Meanwhile, stir together the olive oil and garlic in a small bowl, and set aside. Slice the onion and mozzarella, the thinner the better, and crumble the blue cheese. Set aside. All the toppings should be completely ready to go as soon as the pizza dough hits the skillet.Gently roll or pull the dough ball(s) into 9-inches circles, about the size of the skillet. Use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to brush on the garlic olive oil, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge.At this point, the cast-iron skillet should be super hot! Carefully slide one of the pizza doughs into the skillet (still on the burner), and immediately top with the mozzarella. The bottom of the dough will begin to cook. Add the tomatoes (reserving juice), red onion slices, bacon crumbles, and blue cheese crumbles, taking no more than about 30 seconds.Transfer the skillet to the oven, and place under the broiler with the handle facing to the right. Broil for 1 minute, then (using a heavy-duty potholder) turn the skillet 180 degrees, so that the handle is completely to the left. Broil for another minute or two, until the cheese is melted and the pizza crust is puffy and golden. If bits of the crust begin to blacken and char, that is okay.Remove from the oven and let sit in the skillet for a few minutes. Carefully remove from the skillet, top with fresh basil and/or a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, slice and serve immediately. If you're making two pizzas, (carefully!) wipe out the skillet and begin the process again with the second ball of dough and remaining half of the toppings.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/tomato-bacon-and-blue-cheese-skillet-pizza-612471", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Closet Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Hot-Caramelized-Onion-Dip-247484.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 247484, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Hot Caramelized Onion Dip", "creditText": "Closet Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 ounces cream cheese (softened)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mayonnaise", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 4025, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup parmigiano reggiano (grated)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmigiano reggiano", "metaInformation": ["grated", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "4 large sweet onions (sliced)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet onions", "metaInformation": ["large", "sliced", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11294, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 54.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.closetcooking.com/2009/12/hot-caramelized-onion-dip.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "aggregateLikes": 5818, "instructions": "Directions: 1.

Let cool completely, then gently turn the cakes out on a piece of parchment paper, using a knife to release the edges if needed. Let cool completely before frosting. To make this little cake like I did, use a 2-inch biscuit cutter to cut rounds (you can definitely get 2 rounds, MAYBE 3 if you line it up just right) out of each cake.

cupRecipe courtesy New New Orleans Cooking by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch, Published by William and Morrow, 1993.                                                            Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season duck pieces with Creole spice and brown on all sides, in batches, if necessary. Remove duck pieces to a plate, reduce heat to medium, add lard and melt. Stir in flour and cook, whisking, until it becomes a nutty-brown roux, about 15 minutes. Add onions, celery, bell pepper and cook, stirring often, until tender. Return duck pieces to pot along with stock, bay leaves and garlic. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmering, cover and cook 2 hours, occasionally skimming excess fat from top of gumbo. When sauce is thickened and flavors are well-blended, adjust seasonings, to taste with pepper sauce, Worcestershire, Creole spice, salt and pepper. Serve with steamed rice and green onions.

Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Add the chicken cubes; sprinkle with salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and white pepper; mix well. Mix in 1 cup of cornstarch a little bit at a time until the chicken cubes are well coated.                            In batches, carefully drop the chicken cubes into the hot oil one by one, cooking until they turns golden brown and begin to float, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool as you fry the next batch. Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Cook until the chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.                            Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir a minute or two until the garlic has turned golden and the chiles brighten. Add 1/2 cup sugar, the ginger, chicken broth, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and peanut oil; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.

To brine the pork: Combine 1 1/2 cups cold water, 3 tablespoons salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and stir in the rum. Cool to room temperature. Put the tenderloins in a bowl or shallow container and pour the brine over them. (Or put the tenderloins and brine in a large re-sealable plastic bag.) Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.2. Meanwhile make the slaw: Soak the shallots in cold water for 5 minutes. Toss the cabbage, shallots and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a colander set in the sink. Set aside to drain for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Rinse the cabbage and pat dry. Toss with the peanut oil and vinegar in a large bowl and season with salt.3. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Drain and pat the tenderloins dry, then brush with the olive oil and sprinkle with pepper. Grill the tenderloins, turning as needed to mark all sides, and until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the tenderloin registers 145 degrees F, about 8 minutes per side. Set the tenderloins on a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.4. While the tenderloins cook, toast the rolls on the grill. Brush the bottom half of the toasted rolls with the Creole mustard and mayonnaise. Lightly melt the cheese on the top halves of the toasted bread.   5. Thinly slice the tenderloins and layer on the bread with the slaw, pickles, and pickled peppers, if desired. Serve.

Squeeze juice from lemon and orange into sugar mixture and then throw the halves in as well. . Add the cinnamon sticks. Bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat until sugar is dissolved, then simmer 10 minutes. Skim as necessary. Stir in the honey and return to a boil. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Pour through a sieve into a large bowl and discard the fruit rind while leaving the cinnamon stick inside. Chill until completely cold. NOTE: One time, we left the fruit halves in thinking it might draw out more of the citrus flavour into the syrup. Turns out, that it makes it rather strong and it's best to discard it before cooling it. Make the Baklava: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 170C.Whisk together almonds, walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt until combined well.Brush a 13x9 inch baking dish with melted butter. Cut the phyllo sheets into half along the width and stack them all up. Keep stack covered with  a dampened clean kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out. Lay 2 sheets of phyllo in bottom of baking dish and brush top sheet with butter. Continue to layer 2 sheets at a time, staggering sheets in each double layer slightly to cover bottom of dish, then brushing every second sheet with butter, until you have used 10 sheets of phyllo total. After brushing top layer of phyllo with butter, spread about 1 1/2 cups of nut mixture over it. Spoon over 2 tablespoons butter.Repeat this layering process 3 more times. Top with 10 more sheets of phyllo. (You will use 50 sheets of phyllo total.) Butter top and let baklava stand at room temperature for the butter to firm up slightly to facilitate cutting, 10 to 15 minutes.Using a sharp knife, cut baklava into 16 equal rectangles, then cut each piece in half diagonally, making sure to cut all the way through.Bake baklava until golden, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer dish to a rack to cool, then slowly pour cold syrup around edges of hot baklava, in between all cuts, and over top. Let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours. (Cover once baklava is at room temperature.)

Place in a ziplock bag and refrigerate for 1- to 3-days. (You can skip this step if you want. Just be sure to salt the pork before searing the meat in the next step.)Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven. Cook the pieces of pork shoulder in a single layer until very well-browned, turning them as little as possible so they get nice and dark before flipping them around. If your cooking vessel is too small to cook them in a single-layer, cook them in two batches.Once all the pork is browned, remove them from the pot, then pour in about a cup of water, scraping the bottom of the pan to release all the tasty brown bits.Heat the oven to 350F degrees.Add the pork back to the pan and add enough water so the pork pieces are 2/3rd\u2019s submerged in liquid. Add the cinnamon stick and stir in the chile powders, bay leaves, cumin and garlic.Braise in the oven uncovered for 3\u00bd hours, turning the pork a few times during cooking, until much of the liquid is evaporated and the pork is falling apart. Remove the pan from the oven and lift the pork pieces out of the liquid and set them on a platter.Once the pork pieces are cool enough to handle, shred them into bite-sized pieces, discarding any obvious big chunks of fat, as well as the bay leaves and cinnamon stick.Return the pork pieces back to the roasting pan and cook in the oven, turning occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the pork is crispy and caramelized. It will depend on how much liquid the pork gave off, and how crackly you want them.If making these into sliders, toss the pork with your favorite BBQ sauce and top with pickled red onions.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/on-the-job-freshman-year-other-unnatural-disasters-book-party-479161", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 25, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/chocolate-almond-milkshakes-296102.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 296102, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chocolate Almond Milkshakes", "preparationMinutes": 3, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 pint chocolate ice cream, softened (recommended: Haagen Dazs Dark Chocolate)", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "chocolate ice cream", "metaInformation": ["dark", "softened", "(recommended: Haagen Dazs Chocolate)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-ice-cream.png", "unitLong": "pint", "unitShort": "pt", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19270, "unit": "pint"}, {"originalString": "1 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "low fat vanilla yogurt", "metaInformation": ["low-fat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-vanilla-pudding.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001119, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 (2-ounce) semi-sweet chocolate bar", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "semi-sweet chocolate", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19903, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup smooth, unsalted almond or peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "unsalted peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 16098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup whole milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whole milk", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 59.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/chocolate-almond-milkshakes-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "aggregateLikes": 16, "instructions": "Directions                                                        In a blender, combine the ice cream, milk, yogurt, almond butter, and vanilla.

a stand mixer, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Beat on low for about 30 seconds, until combined.Add the butter and remaining 1/4 cup milk and beat on low until moistened. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and for 90 seconds.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the egg mixture in 3 separate additions, beating on medium after each addition.Divide the batter evenly between the 12 liners (I used a cookie scoop to do this). Bake for 18-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Cool completely on wire racks before frosting.With an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until it becomes pale and creamy (2-3 minutes).Add the powdered sugar and salt and beat on low until combined.

Add the pancetta and cook until golden brown and crispy and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Add the greens, stock, hot sauce vinegar. Cook until the greens are just wilted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add another tablespoon of stock if the greens dry out before they are soft.In a small nonstick pan over medium heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook until the butter begins to shimmer. Whisk the eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the pan and let the eggs cook until the bottom starts to set, up to a minute. With a heat-resistant rubber spatula, gently push one edge of the egg into the center of the pan while tilting the pan to allow the liquid egg to flow in underneath. Repeat with the other edges, until there's no liquid left. Place the greens down the center of the omelet and roll into a cylinder. Remove to a platter, season the top with salt and pepper and top with the parsley.

in a large bowl and whisk until evenly combined.Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment beat together butter and sugars over high speed until light and airy, about 2 minutes. Add the sugars and beat until fluffy and the mixture looks like wet sand, about 2 more minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until just combined.Reduce the speed to medium and add the flour mixture and coconut and beat until just evenly combined. Lay 2 large pieces of plastic wrap on a clean work surface and put half of the dough along the center of each piece. Shape the dough into 2 logs measuring about 1 1/2-inches in diameter and 10-inches long. Roll logs up in the plastic and secure tightly. Refrigerate the logs for 1 hour or up to several weeks.Cut the logs into 1/2-inch slices. Roll the cookies in sugar to coat and shake off excess. Arrange on a baking sheet, leaving 1/2-inch between the cookies. Bake until set and golden on the edges, about 15 to 18 minutes. Remove to cooling racks to cool completely.When cookies are cool, melt the chocolate in a small pan over medium-low heat until smooth. Dip half of each cookie into the chocolate, scrape off excess, and set on a cooling rack. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes to set up before serving.

  Sauce:                                        Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F.Combine all the spices for the rub and massage it into the meat. Place the rubbed pork in a roasting pan and pour the beer into the pan. Cover it with foil and roast for 6 hours. Check it periodically just to make sure everything is going along just fine, turning it over every 2 hours.Remove the foil and roast until the pork has reached an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about another 3 hours. Remove it from the oven, cover it loosely with foil, and let it rest for 30 minutes.Sometime during the marathon cook time, make the sauce. In a small saucepan combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil. Taste it to make sure it is delicious. Remove the chiles. When the sauce is cool, I recommend putting it in a squeeze bottle for easy use.Remove the bone from the pork, it should slide right out. Using your hands with dish gloves on, or with two forks, start to \"pull\" the pork into long shreds. Get rid of the fat and anything else that doesn't look delicious.Serve the pork on burger buns with a drizzle of vinegar sauce to your liking and top with Broccoli Stem and Carrot Slaw.                                                Broccoli Stem and Carrot Slaw:                                        Combine all the ingredients. Season with salt to make sure it is delicious. Let sit for at least 1 hour before serving.

Add oil and once it is hot, add mushrooms and cook until theyve begun to brown and glisten, but have not yet released their liquid. Reduce heat to medium-high, add onions, salt and pepper and saute together until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Add Marsala and cook mixture, stirring, until it has almost or fully evaporated (depending on your preference). Add butter, stir until melted. Add flour, and stir until all has been dampened and absorbed. Add stock, a very small splash at a time, stirring the whole time with a spoon. Make sure each splash has been fully mixed into the butter/flour/mushroom mixture, scraping from the bottom of the pan and all around, before adding the next splash. Repeat until all stock has been added. Let mixture simmer together for 2 minutes, stirring frequently; the sauce will thicken. Remove pan from heat.Assemble and bake dish: If youre cooking in an ovensafe dish, add cooked pasta and stir until combined. (If youre not cooking in an ovensafe dish, transfer this mixture to a 2-quart baking dish.) Stir in half the parmesan, all of the mozzarella and two tablespoons of the parsley until evenly mixed. Sprinkle the top with remaining parmesan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until edges of pasta are golden brown and irresistible. Sprinkle with reserved parsley and serve hot. Reheat as needed.A bunch of notes:Why marsala? Because its the Pantone Color of the Year 2015! More seriously, Marsala is a fortified wine from Sicily with a deep, complex flavor. It comes in dry and sweet versions; for savory dishes, use the dry. (For zabaglione, use the sweet. And invite me over.) It shares some commonalities with Sherry and Madeira, which arent exactly substitutes, but would also taste good here. You can buy dry Marsala it at wine shops inexpensively. I find that mine keeps open in the fridge for a year, but I have a feeling wine experts are grimacing. Seriously, though, ours still tastes for cooking great very long after its been opened and thats all I need to know.We dont consume or cook with alcohol: Heres what Im not going to say, But the alcohol cooks off! as most recipes will tell you because it, yes, it largely/mostly does, but not completely. Since Im cooking for a mixed-age family, I cook mine down to nonexistence (Im after the flavor, not a nap, though naps = swoon, you know?) but I know that many people will not want to use it at all. And you dont have to. This dish will still be incredibly delicious without it. If youre looking to try something clever/delicious in a different way, you might rehydrate a few dried porcinis in 1/4 cup boiling water. Remove them, chop them find and add them to the other mushrooms for a louder mushroom flavor. Then, strain the porcini soaking liquid to remove any sand/grit, add 1 teaspoon sherry or red wine vinegar and use this instead of the Marsala for a little extra flavor oomph.If it werent me making this: You might add some diced cooked chicken to the final baking portion. I personally am incredibly put off by chicken in pasta dishes, but seriously this is no time to start opening the terrifying large can of Implausible Things Deb Doesnt Like.See more: Mushrooms, Pasta, Photo, Vegetarian, Weeknight Favorite, WinterDo more: Link | Bookmark| Pin | Print| Email| 66 Comments", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mushroom-marsala-pasta-bake-625334", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Flaky-Cheddar-Chive-Biscuits-397835.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 397835, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Flaky Cheddar-Chive Biscuits", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup cold butter, cubed", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["cold", "cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1230, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons minced fresh chives", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh chives", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11156, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup (4 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1001009, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 25.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/flaky-cheddar-chive-biscuits", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 18, "instructions": "Directions                                                                                Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

When cherry mixture starts bubbling, add cornstarch mixture and stir until filling is thickened and is no longer milky. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Allow to cool at room temperature for 15 minutes. Move to refrigerator and chill until ready to use.For frosting, cream butter in electric mixer for 1-2 minutes until fluffy. Slowly add confectioners sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, until mixture is smooth. Add vanilla bean, almond extract, and food coloring and mix until combined. Add creamer and mix at medium-high speed until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes). Add more creamer and/or confectioners' sugar as necessary to achieve proper consistency.To assemble, cut a cone-shaped piece out of the tops of cooled cupcakes, approximately 3/4\" in diameter and set aside. Fill cavities with cherry mixture, and replace tops of cupcakes. Pipe on frosting, covering the seams.

"InstructionsTransfer rolled or instant oats to a blender and whiz for a few seconds until flour forms. Carefully spoon out 2 cups of oat flour and transfer to a mixing bowl. Whisk in baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar, and set aside. Add nondairy milk and banana to the blender and whiz until well combined. Pour into oat flour mixture, add raisins and stir to combine. It should be rather soupy. Add a handful (about 1/3 cup) rolled oats and stir. If it's still runny, add more oats. I usually add about 1/2-cup total. The batter should be thick like oatmeal (ha ha!) but not dry. Set batter aside and preheat oven to 375F. Grease a muffin pan and spoon batter into the pan. The batter will thicken and get a little sticky/tacky as it sets.\u00a0If it's so thick you can't stir it easily, thin it out with a little nondairy milk, but you shouldn't need to. It should be thick like oatmeal or heavy mashed potatoes. Spoon into 12 cups, top with cinnamon (and brown sugar if you like) and bake 10-15 minutes, or until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.Note: If you have a rather ripe (very sweet) banana, you probably don't even need the sugar, especially if you're used to eating unsweetened oatmeal. Or you could add a few dates in with the nondairy milk and banana for a naturally sweet alternative.\u00a0Nutritional InformationServing Size: 1Servings Per Batch:                                     12Amount Per ServingCalories                                     90Fat                                     1.30g                                      Carbohydrate                                     16.60gDietary Fiber2.20gSugars2.30gProtein3.20g", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/oatmeal-muffins-oat-flour-muffins-262875", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Food Fanatic", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Italian-Easter-Bread--Brightly-Colored-Tradition-579004.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 579004, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Italian Easter Bread: Brightly Colored Tradition", "preparationMinutes": 135, "creditText": "Food Fanatic", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 1/2 cups bread flour, or all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "bread flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.5, "id": 10120129, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "8 tablespoons butter, room temperature and cubed", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["cubed", "room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 eggs, dyed", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "instant yeast", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.5, "id": 10118375, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup milk, warm (100\u00b0f to 110\u00b0f)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["(100\u00b0f to 110\u00b0f)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 34.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodfanatic.com/2014/04/italian-easter-bread-brightly-colored-tradition/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "aggregateLikes": 16, "instructions": "Begin by dyeing 6 raw eggs, allow them to sit at least one hour to achieve a brilliant color then let them dry while preparing dough.Place warm milk in a medium bowl.

Increase heat to high and add 1/2 tablespoon butter to skillet, then brown bacon, turning over once, about 2 minutes total. Place 2 slices bacon on each rice cake.                                                                Wipe out skillet with a paper towel and heat remaining tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides. Crack eggs one by one into skillet. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper total and fry until whites are cooked and yolks begin to set, 2 to 4 minutes.                                                                Place 1 egg on each rice cake stack and sprinkle with scallion.                                                Cooks' notes:            Rice cakes can be shaped 1 day ahead and chilled, loosely covered after 15 minutes. Allow 2 to 5 minutes longer to cook.The eggs in this recipe will not be fully cooked, which may of concern if salmonella is a problem in your area.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/breakfast-stack-243256", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 300, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Gluten Free Recipe Box", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Gluten-Free-Teff-Bread-562130.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 562130, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Gluten Free Teff Bread", "creditText": "Gluten Free Recipe Box", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 Tablespoons agave syrup", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "agave syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19912, "unit": "Tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons gluten-free apple cider vinegar (I used Heinz)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "apple cider vinegar", "metaInformation": ["gluten-free", "(I used Heinz)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup brown rice flour", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "brown rice flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20090, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 egg whites, at room temperature or 3 Tablespoons gluten-free egg white powder and 5 Tablespoons water", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1034053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoon guar gum", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "guar gum", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 93765, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup potato starch", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "potato starch", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 11413, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 teaspoons sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1012047, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup tapioca flour/starch", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "tapioca flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 93696, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup teff flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "teff flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 93760, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup filtered water, heated to 110\u00b0F", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": ["filtered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup white rice flour (or more brown rice flour)", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "white rice flour", "metaInformation": ["white", "( brown rice flour)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20061, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "xanthan gum", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 93626, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 51.0, "sourceUrl": "http://glutenfreerecipebox.com/gluten-free-bread-with-teff-flour", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 74, "instructions": "Grease a 9\u00d75?

Put the maraschino cherries in a strainer and rinse well with cold water until it runs clear. Scatter the cherries on top of a few layers of paper towel to drain and dry thoroughly, patting dry if necessary. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Melt together the chopped chocolate and coconut oil in a bowl set over a pan of slightly simmering water, stirring until uniform and completely melted. Remove the bowl from the heat.Holding a cherry by the stem, dip in the melted chocolate, rolling to coat completely. Allow excess chocolate to drain off before placing the cherry on its side on the parchment-lined baking sheet (the stem should stick out from the side rather than the top). Repeat with the remaining cherries and chocolate. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to allow to set.If the remaining chocolate mixture in the bowl has hardened, reheat over simmering water until melted again. Remove the chocolate-covered cherries from the refrigerator. Dip the flat end of a chocolate kiss into the melted chocolate, allowing excess to drain off, and then place onto the end opposite the stem end of a cherry. While holding the kiss in place, add 2 almond slices between the cherry and kiss to form ears. Use a toothpick to add 2 small dots of melted chocolate to the kiss, to adhere 2 dragees for eyes. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.Place the baking sheet back in the refrigerator to set up for at least 15 minutes.

                                            Make the Doughnuts: In a small saucepan, warm the milk slightly with 1 teaspoon sugar. Add the yeast and let sit for 5 minutes to proof.In a small bowl, beat the egg with the water.In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment mix the flour, remaining 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Add the proofed yeast mixture, beaten egg mixture, and melted butter. Remove the paddle, switch to a dough hook, and mix until well-blended and kneaded, about 15 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight.On a floured surface, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thick and transfer to a sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes, allowing the dough to rest.Cut dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Line a sheet pan with a buttered sheet of parchment paper.

Pour in the stock/broth.  In a small bowl, toss together the brown sugar, chili powder, kosher salt, cumin and cinnamon.  Pat the meat dry with a paper towel, then using your hands, rub the spices all over the surface and into the crevices of the pork.  Place the pork on top of the onions in the slow cooker.  Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or high for 6 to 8 hours, until the pork is fork tender and easily shreds.When the pork is done, set the slow cooker to the \"warm\" setting and transfer the meat to a cutting board or large platter.  Set a mesh strainer over a heat-proof bowl.  Using oven mitts, remove the slow cooker bowl and pour the onion mixture into the mesh strainer, then return the solids to the slow cooker bowl.  Set the liquid aside.Using 2 forks, shred the cooked pork and discard the fat.  Return the shredded meat into the slow cooker with the onions.  Pour in the BBQ sauce and stir to combine.  Keep warm in the slow cooker until ready to serve.*The BBQ sauce is optional.  If not using the BBQ sauce, pour in about 1/4 cup of the strained liquid until just moistened.  Season to taste with additional salt and pepper.Recipe Source:  Christine Gallary, Chow.com", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/slow-cooker-bbq-pulled-pork-528026", "vegetarian": true,
