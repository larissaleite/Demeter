Stir in garlic and continue cooking for another minute. Add tomatoes and tomato paste, stir well and bring to the boil then reduce heat and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, stirring from time to time. Meanwhile, preaheat your outdoor grill to medium high heat. Place the half chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked all the way through. Transfer the chicken breasts to individual oven safe dishes. Top each breast with half the tomato sauce, then sprinkle the cheeses overtop the two dishes. Place on the higher rack of your oven and set to broil, just until cheeses melt and start to bubble and turn golden brown.
