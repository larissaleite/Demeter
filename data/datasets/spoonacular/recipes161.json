If it crumbles or falls apart, it\u2019s too dry and needs more moisture or a binding ingredient such as additional agave, sunflower seed butter, or dates to be added in order for it to come together. Conversely, add more oats if mixture seems very sloppy or wet, noting that 1 cup cereal will be stirred in next, absorbing some moisture. This is not an exact science and you may need to play with the ratios of wet and dry ingredients, but the goal is a mixture that can be packed into a pan, and when sliced, will hold it\u2019s shape in bar form; it should be thick, moist, and dense. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and stir in the crispy rice cereal, slightly crushing it while folding it in with the spoon. Keep folding until all the cereal appears to disappear into the mixture. Firmly press mixture into an even flat layer in prepared pan and smooth it with a spatula; set pan aside. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips on high power, about 1 minute. Stir until chips are melted and smooth, reheating in 10 to 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth. Drizzle chocolate over the dough and place pan in the refrigerator to set up for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Bars may be wrapped individually in plasticwrap or stored in an airtight container and kept at room temperature for up to 1 week, or stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month, or can be frozen for up to 3 months.

Toss the apples with a spatula till evenly coated by the lemon juice, zest, and nutmeg.Chop the unsalted butter into several very small chunks.Grease a 9x13 baking dish with unsalted butter. Create a single thick layer of apple slices on the bottom of the dish, covering the entire surface with apples.Sprinkle a generous layer of brown sugar on top of the apples.Dot a few bits of butter across the top of the sugar.Sprinkle a thin layer of bread crumbs on top of the butter.Repeat this process of layering-- apple slices, brown sugar, butter, and bread crumbs-- until the dish is full. Finish the dish with a thin layer of bread crumbs.Bake the pudding uncovered for 50-60 minutes until the edges brown, the pudding is cooked through, and the apples are soft. Serve warm topped with cream sauce, if desired.Pour heavy whipping cream into a small pot and warm slowly over medium heat, whisking occasionally as it warms. When cream begins to boil, whisk in powdered sugar, nutmeg, and almond extract.Remove from heat. Strain the sauce through a mesh strainer or sieve into a serving dish. Serve warm sauce over hot slices of Apple Bread Pudding. This is not a thick sauce, and it will need to be stirred from time to time to keep a skin from forming on the surface.

Pound the butter with a rolling pin to soften it, add it to the well, and work the ingredients in the well with the fingers of one hand until thoroughly mixed. Using a pastry scraper, gradually draw in the flour from the sides of the well and continue working with both hands until coarse crumbs form. If the crumbs seem dry, sprinkle with another tablespoon of water; the crumbs should be soft but not sticky. Gently press the crumbs into a ball; the dough will be uneven and unblended at this point.2. To blend the dough, sprinkle the work surface with flour and put the dough on it. With the heel of your hand, push the dough away from you, flattening it against the work surface. Gather it up, press it into a rough ball, and flatten it again. This flattening motion evenly blends the butter with the other ingredients without overworking the dough. Work quickly so the butter doesn\u2019t get too warm. Continue until the dough is as pliable as putty and pulls away from the surface in one piece, 1 to 2 minutes. Shape it into a ball, wrap, and chill until firm, 15 to 30 minutes.

Sift the flour onto a work surface and make a well in the center. Put the egg yolk, salt, and water in the well. Pound the butter with a rolling pin to soften it, add it to the well, and work the ingredients in the well with the fingers of one hand until thoroughly mixed. Using a pastry scraper, gradually draw in the flour from the sides of the well and continue working with both hands until coarse crumbs form. If the crumbs seem dry, sprinkle with another tablespoon of water; the crumbs should be soft but not sticky. Gently press the crumbs into a ball; the dough will be uneven and unblended at this point.2. To blend the dough, sprinkle the work surface with flour and put the dough on it. With the heel of your hand, push the dough away from you, flattening it against the work surface. Gather it up, press it into a rough ball, and flatten it again. This flattening motion evenly blends the butter with the other ingredients without overworking the dough. Work quickly so the butter doesn\u2019t get too warm. Continue until the dough is as pliable as putty and pulls away from the surface in one piece, 1 to 2 minutes. Shape it into a ball, wrap, and chill until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. P\u00e2te bris\u00e9e may be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.Make the tarte3. Peel and halve the apples; scoop out the cores with a melon baller or the point of a paring knife.4. Melt the butter in the mold, sprinkle in the sugar, and cook over medium heat without stirring until it starts to brown and caramelize. Stir gently, then continue cooking until the caramel is a deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes total. Let cool in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes. The butter will separate, but this does not matter.5. Arrange the apples in the mold in concentric circles, with the cut sides standing vertically. The caramel will help to anchor them. Pack them as tightly as possible, as they will shrink during cooking. Cook the apples over medium heat until the juice starts to run, about 8 minutes, then raise the heat and cook them as fast as possible until the underside is caramelized to a deep gold and most of the juice has evaporated, 15 to 25 minutes.6. With a two-pronged fork, turn the apples one by one so the upper sides are now down in the caramel. Continue cooking until this second side is brown also and almost all the juice has evaporated, 10 to 20 minutes more. The time will vary with the variety and ripeness of the apples, and can take up to 1 hour total. Let them cool to tepid while heating the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).7.
