If the mixture feels sandy, continue warming and stirring until the mixture is smooth.Stir in the half and half and whipping cream.

Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches about 230 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 238 degrees.Let the candy sit until the bubbling has stopped. Add the marshmallow cream and vanilla on top of the hot candy, but dont stir. After the candy has cooled a bit, give the candy a quick stir to combine the marshmallow and vanilla but dont worry about completely combining at this step. Let candy sit without stirring until cooled to approximately 140 to 150 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes.When candy is cooled to approximately 140 to 150 degrees, remove the candy thermometer and beat the candy with a wooden spoon until the candy thickens slightly and just begins to lose its gloss, 1 to 2 minutes. Quickly add the walnuts and stir just until mixed.Scrape the candy into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.

Can also substitute 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound of Italian sausage or Mexican chorizo sausage, if desired. Can also use ground turkey.Other serving suggestions: Serve chili alone, with grated cheese, or a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkling of sliced green onion, raw yellow or sweet chopped onion, raw chopped garlic, or other toppings as desired. Also good served over hot, cooked rice or cornbread.Tip: Did you know that my layered nachos recipe is a great way to use leftover chili?Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chili-spaghetti-244018", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 80, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simply Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Spaghetti-Squash-and-Chard-Saut-245099.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 80, "id": 245099, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Spaghetti Squash and Chard Saut\u00e9", "preparationMinutes": 20, "creditText": "Simply Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "apple cider vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1 large bunch of chard, center rib removed, leaves chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "chard", "metaInformation": ["large", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/swiss-chard.jpg", "unitLong": "bunch", "unitShort": "bunch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11147, "unit": "bunch"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon chili pepper flakes", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili flakes", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1032009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh parsley", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11297, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh rosemary", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2063, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp minced garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3 to 4 Tbsp olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmesan cheese", "metaInformation": ["freshly grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 3 to 4 lb spaghetti squash", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "spaghetti squash", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti-squash.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11492, "unit": "lb"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spaghetti_squash_and_chard_saute/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 1298, "instructions": "1 Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans, then line them parchment paper. Grease them again and dust lightly with flour.In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until light yellow and fluffy. Crack the eggs into a small bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl once during mixing. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and mix well. The mixture might look curdled; don't be concerned.In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and the milk to the batter in 3 parts, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Fold in the 4 ounces of coconut with a rubber spatula.Pour the batter evenly into the 2 pans and smooth the top with a knife. Bake in the center of the oven for 45 to 55 minutes, until the tops are browned and a cake tester comes out clean. Cool on a baking rack for 30 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a baking rack to finish cooling.For the frosting, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and almond extract on low speed. Add the confectioners' sugar and mix until just smooth (don't whip!).To assemble, place 1 layer on a flat serving plate, top side down, and spread with frosting. Place the second layer on top, top side up, and frost the top and sides. To decorate the cake, sprinkle the top with coconut and lightly press more coconut onto the sides. Serve at room temperature.                                                    2006, Barefoot Contessa at Home, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.For the crust: Brush a 10-inch springform pan with some of the melted butter. Stir together the remaining butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan. Use the back of a measuring cup or a drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly into the edges of the pan. Bake until browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place the pan on a baking sheet.For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream, and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the cream and vanilla extract, and mix until just combined. Beat in the eggs one at time, beating the mixture after the last egg until just combined (take care not to overmix or the cake will turn into a souffle).Pour the filling in to the crust. Bake until the cheesecake is slightly golden and barely set in the middle when the pan is tapped, about 1 hour and 20 minutes (the cake might puff up slightly while in the oven, but that is okay; it will deflate as it cools). Turn off the oven, and leave the cake inside with the door shut for 1 hour. It will continue to set and color slightly in the oven.Run a thin knife or spatula around the cake to release it from the sides (this also helps reduce cracks in the top of the cake as it chills). Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.For the cranberry compote: Stir the sugar, dried cranberries and 1 cup water together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then add the fresh cranberries. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the fresh cranberries have burst and the sauce is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the compote to a heat-safe bowl and let it cool slightly before covering the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerating until it is completely chilled. The cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools. (This can be made up to one day in advance.)For serving: Spread the cranberry compote in an even layer on top of the chilled cheesecake. The cheesecake will sink a bit in the center as it cools so it creates a perfect well for the cranberry compote. Run a thin knife or spatula between the cake and the sides again, then release the sides of the springform pan and remove the ring from the cheesecake base. Set the base on a cake platter, slice and serve.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Add the onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the flour and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes, then gradually whisk in the half-and-half until smooth. Add the chicken broth, bay leaves and nutmeg, then season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until thickened, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the bread bowls: Using a sharp knife, cut a circle into the top of each loaf, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Remove the bread top, then hollow out the middle with a fork or your fingers, leaving a thick bread shell.Add the broccoli and carrot to the broth mixture and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Puree the soup in batches in a blender until smooth; you'll still have flecks of carrot and broccoli. Return to the pot. (Or puree the soup in the pot with an immersion blender.)Add the cheese to the soup and whisk over medium heat until melted. Add up to 3/4 cup water if the soup is too thick. Ladle into the bread bowls and garnish with cheese.Photograph by Kate Mathis                                                            When blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway.

Add the olive oil, sesame oil, peanut butter, honey, mustard, soy sauce and lime juice. Season the dressing with salt and pepper. Whisk together until emulsified, about 1 minute.For the salad: Add the spaghetti, carrots, peppers, scallions and cilantro to the bowl. Using tongs, toss until the noodles are coated with the dressing. Cover the bowl, and marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight, so the noodles can absorb the flavors from the dressing.

    Preheat grill to medium-high and coat with oil.Season both sides of each salmon fillet with salt and pepper and place on the grill. Grill until the center is still slightly pink, 6 to 8 minutes total, rotating fish 90 degrees halfway during cooking on each side to obtain hash marks. Remove from the grill.Meanwhile, make the pear butter sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the diced pears, sugar, and hard cider. Cook over medium-high heat until the pears are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Add the butter several pieces at a time, whisking constantly to blend, and removing from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from breaking. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper and whisk to blend. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve, stirring occasionally. (Do not allow sauce to boil or it will separate.)Place the salmon on the plate with the roasted potatoes, drizzle the pear butter over the salmon and serve immediately.                                                Herb Roasted  Fingerling Potatoes:                                        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Halve any larger potatoes so that they will all be about the same size. Put potatoes in a large bowl and season with olive oil, salt, and pepper, tossing to coat. Transfer potatoes and any oil from the bowl to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread into a single layer. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring potatoes halfway through with a long-handled spoon. Remove potatoes from oven and sprinkle with freshly minced herbs and garlic. Return potato mixture to the oven and roast an additional 15 minutes or until tender.Yield: 4 to 6 servings                                                    Recipe courtesy of Emeril Lagasse, 2007

Trim any excess fat and season both sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat a large skillet to medium high heat. Add  tablespoon of butter and  tablespoon of the olive oil until the butter is melted then add 3 of the chicken breasts to the pan. Cook undisturbed until you can see that the chicken is cooking through on the one side, about 3-4 minutes. Use tongs to flip the chicken over once it is nicely browned and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes or until the thickest part of the chicken reaches 160 degrees F. Transfer to a plate and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm and rest. Wipe out the pan with paper towels and add  tablespoon of butter and the remaining olive oil. Repeat with the remaining three chicken breasts. Transfer to the plate with the other cooked chicken.Wipe out the pan again and over medium heat, and melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the mushrooms and leeks to the pan with a pinch of kosher salt. Cook while stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are softened and the leeks are becoming limp. Add the wine and continue to cook for 2 minutes.

Lightly dredge the seasoned trout in the flour, shaking off any excess. Set a 10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil to the pan. Once the oil is hot, place the fish fillets in the pan, 2 at a time and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side. Place the cooked fillets on an oven-proof platter and place in the oven while you cook the remaining fillets.Once the fish are cooked, return the skillet to the stovetop and set on medium heat. Add the butter to the pan and once melted, add the shallots. As the shallots cook, and the butter stops foaming, about 30 seconds, add the white wine, lemon juice and parsley to the pan. Continue to cook for 15 to 20 seconds, swirling the pan occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Remove the fish from the oven and pour the sauce over top the fish. Serve immediately.

Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and brush some coconut oil on the surface. I use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to grab a dollops of pancake batter, place them on the pan, and spread them out a bit. The batter will be thicker than traditional pancake batter, so they need a little help spreading. For best results, cover the pan to allow pancakes to steam while they cook. Cook until the edges look dry and the pancakes are golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side. Keep warm while you continue to cook in batches.To make the compote, combine the clementine pieces, 1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste, and the juice from the remaining lemon in a small bowl. Serve the compote over the pancakes and drizzle with honey.Nat's Notes:1. If you don't have vanilla bean paste, you can use 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract in the batter and 1/4 teaspoon in the compote.2. If you can't find Meyer lemons, substitute one lemon and two clementines (juice and zest).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/grain-free-dreamsicle-pancakes-with-clementine-vanilla-bean-compote-556988", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 40, "servings": 20, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Allrecipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Shrimp-and-Mushroom-Angel-Hair-Pasta-423733.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 423733, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Shrimp and Mushroom Angel Hair Pasta", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Allrecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 pound angel hair pasta", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "angel hair pasta", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/angelhair.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10020420, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup butter, divided", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup dry white wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "dry white wine", "metaInformation": ["dry white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 14106, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms-white.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 11260, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "4 cloves garlic, crushed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon ground white pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground pepper", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 pint heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "pint", "unitShort": "pt", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "pint"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup port wine", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "port wine", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10114057, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "salt to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons chopped shallots", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shallots", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11677, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined and butterflied", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "shrimp", "metaInformation": ["large", "deveined", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 15152, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 50.0, "sourceUrl": "http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Shrimp-and-Mushroom-Angel-Hair-Pasta/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "aggregateLikes": 14, "instructions": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Set aside.In a large wok cook your broccoli first. Use about 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil, cook over medium high heat for about 5 to 8 minutes depending how soft or crisp you like your broccoli. I like mine soft. Remove the broccoli and set aside. Now in the same wok use a little more olive oil, bring to a glisten, then pop in your tenderloin and onions. Cook over medium high heat until cooked through.I like mine well done so it took about 5 or 6 minutes max. Once the steak is done pour in the sauce and stir well. Then add the broccoli back in and stir some more to evenly coat and thicken. If you want it saucier double the sauce ingredients. If you find it getting too thick add some water. If you find it getting dry at any point during cooking add more olive oil. It goes great over basmati rice.
