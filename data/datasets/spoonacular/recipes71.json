Pull thyme leaves off the sprigs and add to saucepan. Add arborio rice to saucepan and toast for about a minute, until any liquid is absorbed. Add red wine to pan and use it to deglaze, scraping any burnt or crispy bits off the bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until rice has absorbed all wine, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock and cook, stirring frequently, until rice has absorbed all stock. Repeat this process, adding 1 cup of stock at a time and letting the rice absorb it in between each addition, until rice is al dente. Taste the rice in between each addition of stock to see if it needs more; the final product should have a slight bite to it and not be mushy, and the rice and stock will have formed a thick, starchy broth. I generally use about 6 cups of stock before the risotto is done. When rice is al dente and a thick stock has formed, remove risotto from heat. Stir in unsalted butter and parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until they've both melted into the risotto. Taste again and add seasoning if necessary.

Stale bread works best for stuffing-if yours is fresh, spread out the cubes on baking sheet and dry in a 300 degrees F oven, 15 to 20 minutes.Heat 1 stick butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, sage, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth; bring to a simmer and remove from the heat.Beat the eggs and parsley in a large bowl; stir in the bread cubes, the vegetable-broth mixture, the prepared pears, sausage and almonds.Transfer the mixture to a buttered 3-to-4-quart baking dish and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cover with foil and bake at 375 degrees F, 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden, about 20 more minutes.Photograph by Yunhee Kim                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and a 12 by 17-inch jelly roll pan with a silicone baking mat or lightly grease with butter. Spread the chopped pecans evenly onto parchment lined baking sheet and toast in preheated for 7 - 8 minutes, or until very lightly browned. Set aside.Melt butter in a 3-quart heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon (about every 2 minutes). Once butter has fully melted, add the water, 1 cup (200g) of the sugar, salt and corn syrup. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves, then brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Attach a candy thermometer to pan, without letting it touch the bottom of pan.Once the sugar has dissolved, bring mixture to a boil. Rapid bubbles, a thicker consistency, and a slightly darker color form around 235F (113C). Stir lightly once every minute until candy reaches 290F (143C).Remove pan from heat, stir in pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup of the pecans. Pour toffee onto baking sheet lined with silicone liner. Smooth into an even layer with a wooden spoon (toffee should be thick and won't spread to edges of pan). Allow toffee to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile in a small bowl whisk together cinnamon and remaining 2 Tbsp (25g) sugar. Sprinkle white chocolate evenly over slightly cooled toffee and allow white chocolate to rest until it has melted then spread into an even layer. Sprinkle the top evenly with remaining pecans and cinnamon sugar mixture. Refrigerate for 20 minutes, or until white chocolate has set.Once set, remove from refrigerator and cut or break into pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks or freeze up to 3 minutes.Recipe source: recipe from Sally's Candy Addiction, pg. 108.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Let them sit until the yeast starts to bubble, about 5 minutes.Add the flour and salt to the yeast mixture and beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes, or until the batter is smooth and it stretches when you lift out the beater. Remove the bowl from the mixer and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place in a warm, draft-free area until the mixture has doubled in size and is bubbly on top, about 1 hour.In a small bowl, stir together the water and baking soda. Stir this mixture into the batter, then set aside for 30 minutes.Heat a large skillet over medium low heat. Spray the surface lightly with nonstick cooking spray, and spray 4- 2 -inch crumpet molds. Place the molds in the skillet.

Butter a 1-quart casserole dish and set aside.Make topping by combining all ingredients.  Mix well and set aside.Wash and drain spinach and place in a large non-stick pot over high heat.  Once spinach starts to wilt, lower heat and steam until all of the spinach is wilted, stirring frequently to make sure it doesn\u2019t stick to the sides.  This will take just a few minutes.  Do not overcook the spinach.  Remove spinach from the pot and drain in a colander.  Place the cooked spinach on a clean kitchen towel and press to remove the excess water (This may have to be done twice).  Place the spinach on a cutting board and rough chop it.  Cover with a towel and set aside.In a small saucepan, combine milk and heavy cream and 2 cloves smashed garlic.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Simmer a few minutes over very low heat and then cover and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse the garlic flavor.  Remove the smashed cloves.  If a little garlic remains, that\u2019s fine.Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, combine olive oil and 1 Tablespoon of butter and heat until the foaming subsides.  Add mushrooms, reduce heat and saut\u00e9 over medium heat.  Season with a little Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Cook until mushrooms are almost brown, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Add the sherry and cook until mushrooms are nicely browned and sherry has evaporated.  Set aside.Melt 2 Tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, reducing heat to low, until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Gradually add flour and salt, stirring constantly.  Cook a few minutes over medium-low heat, continue stirring, until roux is smooth.  Slowly add milk and cream mixture in a steady stream to the roux, whisking constantly.

A fillet less than 1-inch thick should only take 10 to 12 minutes). Note: Keep the oven light on to ensure the salmon does not catch fire - while this has never happened to me, it is possible for food to ignite when its under the broiler.Remove salmon from oven and

"1.  Make the brownies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line bottom and 2 sides of a 9x9-inch pan with a sheet of parchment paper.  Spray 2 unlined sides with nonstick spray.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the butter and sugar.  Set aside to cool.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs.  Add the cocoa, baking powder, salt and vanilla.  Stir to fully combine.  Add the slightly cooled butter/sugar mixture to the egg/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.  Stir in the flour and chocolate chips to the batter and stir until fully incorporated.  Spread the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top to even it out.  Bake brownies 22 to 25 minutes.  They'll be done when a toothpick inserted inter the center should reveal a few moist crumbs but no wet batter.  Cool completely before cutting.  You can run a knife along the sides and use the parchment to transfer them to a cutting board.  If you need to store them, they'll be fine in a covered container for up to 3 days, and they can also be frozen.  Cut about 1/3 of the pan of brownies into small chunks for the shortcakes.

"instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, then add in squash with 1/4 teaspoon salt, the pepper and the nutmeg. Stir to coat well and add in 1/3 cup stock. Cover and cook until softened, about 10-12 minutes. Once soft, remove squash with a large spoon (and any extra stock, though most of it will cook away) and place in a bowl. Mash well with a potato mashed or fork.At this time, prepare the water for the pasta and boil according to directions, shaving a minute or 2 off the time since you will cook the pasta more in the oven. While water is boil/pasta is cooking, continue with the rest of the recipe. With the skillet still hot, add in the other tablespoon of olive oil, then toss in onion with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Still well to coat, cooking for 2-3 minutes until slightly soft, then add in ground chicken with remaining salt to season. Break apart the chicken using a wooden spoon, continuing to do so as it cooks so it is in small bits. Cook until golden and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Once cooked, remove chicken and onions (if a few remain it's fine) and place in a smaller bowl. With the skillet still hot, add in butter and once it sizzles, whisk in flour. Cook for 1-2 minutes until golden and nutty, then add in milk, stirring constantly. Continue to stir and one it begins to thicken and bubble on the sides, whisk in mascarpone and parmesan with a pinch of nutmeg, turning the heat down to low. At this time, add the mashed butternut squash back into the milk mixture and whisk to combine. It will probably be very, very thick so add in additional stock, beginning with 1/4 cup, stirring until it is just a bit thinner. Note: it will still be pretty thick! Use your judgement and add a little more if needed. You can also taste the \"sauce\" here and season more if desired. Add in the chicken/onion mixture and slowly add the lasagna noodles, strategically placing them if needed.
