Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and butter an 8 inch round baking pan (or 8x8 rectangular pan) with vegan butter. Toss with some white rice flour (or other GF flour) to coat the edges and remove excess. Set aside.Add avocado and banana to a large mixing bowl and mash.Add honey (or maple syrup or agave), vanilla, coconut oil and stir. Measure out 1 cup almond milk and toss in the vinegar. Let set for a minute or two then add to the mixture and whisk.Next add baking soda and powder and mix vigorously to combine.Add cocoa powder, salt, gluten free flour blend, and coconut flour to a sifter (reserving oat flour since it's more coarse) and sift over wet ingredients. Whisk vigorously to combine.Last, add oat flour and stir once more. Taste a bit to see if it needs more honey. Then pour into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.Bake for 40-48 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cracks on the top are fine and actually good. The edges should be pulling away from the sides just slightly.Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 1 hour.

When done with cooking, add chopped cilantro and squeeze fresh lime juice on top of rice. Cover and let steam until needed. While rice is cooking, make chicken filling.2) Dice chicken and sear it in a large skillet with a few tablespoons of olive oil until it's cooked through over medium-high heat. That'll take about 10 minutes. Let cool and then chop well.3) Add good drizzle of olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add onions and cook until soft, about 4-5 minutes.4) Stir in chiles, corn, and chicken to onion mixture.5) Add one cup water and cook mixture stirring frequently. 6) Adjust flavors to your liking. Might need a pinch of salt and pepper or more chiles if you want it spicier.To make a burrito:1) Heat tortilla in the microwave for 15 seconds to make it soft.2) Add a layer of hot cilantro rice to the bottom of the tortilla. Top with grated cheese.3) Top cheese with hot chicken filling. Top filling with any other toppings you want.4) Roll burrito tightly and let rest for a minute so the cheese melts from the heat of the rice and filling.Eat immediately!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/colorado-burrito-537029", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Whole-Wheat-Apricot-Walnut-Bread-197913.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 197913, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Whole Wheat Apricot-Walnut Bread", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup diced dried apricots", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "apricots", "metaInformation": ["dried", "diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apricot.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9021, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "instant yeast", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.5, "id": 10118375, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "6 tablespoons maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19911, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup chopped walnuts", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "walnuts", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/walnuts.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 12155, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 1/2 cups (about 14 ounces) whole wheat flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "whole wheat flour", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 14.0, "id": 20080, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 93.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/apricot-walnut-whole-wheat-bread-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 86, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together yeast, flour, and salt.

(I prefer to use rice brain oil because it has a high smoke temperature.)Add patties to hot pan and press down with a flat spatula. Let cook for about 1 minute until crust has formed. Brush top with glaze. Flip patty and brush other side with glaze. Cook for another minute, flip, and brush again. Do not overcrowd the burgers. Work in batches, if necessary.Once burger is cooked, remove from skillet and transfer to plate and allow to cool slightly.  Heat a clean skillet over medium heat. Brush buns with oil. Lightly toast buns on hot pan.Spread gochujang mayo on buns, top with burger patty, quick pickles and greens of choice. Serve and enjoy immediately.Gochujang Mayo: In a small bowl, mix together mayo and red pepper paste until smooth.Quick Pickles: Toss sliced cucumbers in sugar and salt. Let sit for 5 minutes.

Set the milled tomatoes aside.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Return the pot to medium heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil. Stir in the onion, reduce the heat to medium-low, and saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is shiny and beginning to soften. Pour in the tomatoes, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Return the meat to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low or low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer, stirring it from time to time, for about 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and the sauce is thickened. Add a splash or two of water if the sauce thickens too much before the meat is done. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if you like.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Turn off the heat. Remove the meat from the pot before using the sauce.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            For the Fresh Egg Pasta Dough: To mix the dough in the food processor: Put 2 cups \u201c00\u201d flour, the 1 tbsp semolina flour, salt, and nutmeg into the work bowl and pulse briefly to combine. Break the eggs into the work bowl and drizzle in 1 tbsp of the olive oil. Process the mixture until it forms crumbs that look like small curds. Pinch together a bit of the mixture and roll it around. It should form a soft ball. If the mixture seems dry, drizzle in the remaining 1 tbsp oil and pulse briefly. If it seems too wet and sticky, add additional flour, 1 tbsp at a time, and pulse briefly.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface sprinkled lightly with semolina flour and press it together with your hands to form a rough ball. Knead the dough: Using the palm of your hand, push the dough gently but firmly away from you, and then fold it over toward you. Rotate the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the pushing and folding motion. Continue kneading for several minutes until the dough is smooth and silky. Form it into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            To mix the dough by hand: Combine 2 1/4 cups \u201c00\u201d flour, the 1 tbsp semolina flour, salt, and nutmeg on a clean work surface and pile into a mound. Make a well in the center of the mound, and break the eggs into it. Drizzle 1 tbsp of the olive oil into the well. With a fork, break the egg yolks and whisk together the eggs and oil. Using the fork, gradually draw the flour from the inside wall of the well into the egg mixture until it has a batterlike consistency. Work carefully so that you don\u2019t break the wall of flour, causing the egg mixture to run out and things to get messy. (If this happens, don\u2019t panic; just use your palms to scoop up the egg mixture and work it back into the flour.)                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Now, use your hands to draw the remaining wall of flour over the thickened egg mixture and begin to mix it and knead it. Using the palm of your hand, push the dough gently but firmly away from you, and then fold it over toward you. Rotate the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the pushing and folding motion. Use a dough scraper to dislodge any bits stuck to the work surface. The dough will begin as a shaggy mass but will eventually turn smooth as you knead it over several minutes. You may not use all of the flour on the work surface. When the dough is smooth and silky, form it into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching it.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Stretching the dough: Set up your pasta machine with the rollers on the widest setting (#1 on my standard Marcato Atlas machine). Scatter a little semolina flour on the work surface around the machine and have more on hand for sprinkling on the dough.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Cut the dough into four equal pieces, and rewrap three pieces. Knead the remaining piece briefly on the work surface. Then, using a rolling pin or patting it with the heel of your hand, form the dough into an oval 3 to 4 in long and about 3 in wide. Feed the dough through the rollers of the pasta machine, and then lay the strip on the work surface. Fold the dough into thirds, like folding a business letter, sprinkle with a little semolina, and pass it through the rollers again.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Repeat the folding and rolling process a few more times, until the strip of dough is smooth. Move the roller setting to the next narrower notch and feed the strip of dough through the setting twice, sprinkling it with a little semolina each time to keep it from sticking and then moving the notch to the next setting. Continue to pass the dough through the rollers twice on each setting, until you have stretched it to the appropriate thickness. This will depend on which cut you are making, so be sure to read carefully the individual recipes and instructions for cutting the various shapes. Most recipes, including those for ravioli and lasagne, call for stretching the dough very thin\u2014about 1/16 in\u2014though some cuts require a thicker sheet. On my machine, passing the dough through the second-narrowest roller setting (#6) produces a very thin pasta sheet, so I usually don\u2019t stretch past that setting.                                                                                                                             12                                                                            Once you have stretched your piece of dough (it will be a fairly long ribbon, depending on how thin you have stretched it), lay it out on a semolina-dusted surface and cover it lightly with plastic wrap while you stretch the remaining 3 pieces.                                                                                                                            13                                                                            To make the palottine: Put the veal, salt, nutmeg, and egg in a bowl and mix together thoroughly (I use my hands). With your fingers, pinch off a very small piece of the mixture and roll it into a tiny ball\u2014not much larger than a chickpea. Place the meatball on a clean tray or platter. Repeat until you have rolled all of the veal mixture into meatballs.                                                                                                                             14                                                                            Pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1/4 in in a frying pan, place over medium-high heat, and heat to 375\u00b0F on a deep-frying thermometer. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, carefully drop a meatball into the hot oil; if it sizzles on contact, the oil is ready. Place a platter lined with a double layer of paper towels or a large, plain brown-paper bag near the stove.                                                                                                                             15                                                                            Carefully add the meatballs to the hot oil, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan. Fry them, turning them from time to time with a spatula, slotted spoon, or even a fork, for about 4 minutes, or until they are lightly browned. Use a slotted spoon or a skimmer to remove the meatballs to the prepared platter. Repeat until all the meatballs are fried.                                                                                                                             16                                                                            Transfer the meatballs to the pot with the rag\u00f9. Return the sauce to a simmer over medium-low heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep the sauce at a very low simmer while you cook the pasta.                                                                                                                            17                                                                            Bring a very large pot or a stockpot of water to a rolling boil and salt generously.  Carefully drop each maccheroni \u201cnest\u201d into the boiling water and stir to separate the strands. Cover the pot until the water returns to a boil, then uncover and cook for just a couple of minutes, or until very al dente. Taste a strand to make sure it is slightly undercooked. Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water.                                                                                                                             18                                                                            Return the drained pasta to the pot and spoon about two-thirds of the sauce over it. Gently toss the pasta and sauce to combine thoroughly, adding a splash or two of the cooking water if necessary to loosen the sauce. Transfer the dressed pasta to a warmed serving bowl or shallow individual bowls and spoon the remaining sauce over the top. Sprinkle with a little Parmigiano and serve immediately. Pass additional cheese at the table, along with a small bowl of chiles.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cook-the-book-maccheroni-alla-chitarra-with-rag-abruzzese-and-palottine-206348", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/smores-cereal-treats-771142.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 771142, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "S'mores Cereal Treats", "preparationMinutes": 50, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "7 cups graham-flavored cereal, such as Golden Grahams", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "cereal", "metaInformation": [" such as golden grahams", "graham-flavored"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bran-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 7.0, "id": 8029, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "12 fun-size chocolate bars, cut into thirds", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "fun size butterfinger", "metaInformation": ["cut into thirds"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butterfinger.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 12.0, "id": 19069, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 10-ounce bag mini marshmallows", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "marshmallows", "metaInformation": ["mini"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marshmallows-mini.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 19116, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "plus more for greasing"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 60.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/smores-cereal-treats.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 21, "aggregateLikes": 597, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Grease a 1/2 dry measuring cup with butter and line a 12-cup muffin tray with cupcake liners.

   Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Fill 4 pie or cake tins (or a baking dish large enough to hold oysters) with rock salt, but no more than half full (use just enough salt to keep the oysters from rocking back and forth). Place the tins in the oven briefly to warm.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Prepare the topping: Saute the shallots, celery, and parsley in 4 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet for approximately 5\u20137 minutes.

Add the remaining butter, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, peppers, and Pernod or Anisette. Blend for a minute at medium speed.

Spray two 12-count Non-Stick Mini Muffin Pans\u00a0\u00a0very well with floured cooking spray or grease and flour the pans; set aside. (I don't prefer the cosmetic look of muffin liners and I am not sure if the paper will stick to the muffins). Alternatively, the recipe can be made as regular-sized muffins; use a\u00a0Non-Stick 12-Cup Regular Muffin Pan In a large bowl, mash the banana with a fork. Add the sugar, milk (room temp milk will prevent coconut oil from re-solidifying; if it does anyway, some small clumps are okay), oil, vanilla, cinnamon, and whisk until combined. Add the flour, baking powder, optional salt, and stir until just combined; don't overmix. Fold in 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Divide batter equally among the cavities of the prepared pans using approximately one rounded or heaping tablespoon of batter for each muffin. Each cavity will be about 3/4 full. Spraying\u00a0a medium\u00a0cookie scoop,\u00a0with cooking spray so the batter slides right off is handy here. Optionally, add a pinch of chocolate chips to each muffin top. Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until tops are domed, puffed, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs dangling but no batter. I baked for 11 minutes, but because pan sizes, climates, and ovens vary, bake until done; watch your muffins and not the clock. If you're baking as regular-sized muffins, my guess is about 15 to 20 minutes. Allow muffins to cool in pan for about 10 to 15 minutes before removing and placing on a rack to cool completely. Muffins will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
