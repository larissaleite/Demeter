F. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.In a large saut pan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp to the pan in an even layer and let cook without moving, about 1 minute. While cooking, sprinkle 1/2 tsp. of chipotle powder on top of the shrimp. Then flip the shrimp over and continue to cook until just pink and opaque, 30-60 seconds longer. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside. When the shrimp is cool enough to handle, roughly chop into bite sized pieces, if desired. Set aside.Melt the remaining butter in the pan. Add the garlic and onion, and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the cole slaw and spinach, as well as the other 1/2 tsp. of chipotle powder, plus the oregano, salt, pepper, and cayenne to the pan. Stir well, and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the spinach just begins to wilt. Add the shrimp back in, stir to combine, then remove pan from heat and set aside.Steam the tortillas using a tortilla warmer, or place between two damp paper towels and microwave for 10 seconds. Set tortillas aside and keep warm. Also prepare the jalapeno cream sauce, as detailed below.To assemble the enchiladas, place a steamed tortilla on a flat surface. And (working quickly, so that the tortilla doesn't dry out), fill the middle of the tortilla with about 1/3 cup of the shrimp/cabbage filling. Then sprinkle some cheese on top, and carefully roll the tortilla and place it seam side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Drizzle the top with about half of the jalapeno cream sauce, then cover the dish with foil and bake for about 20 minutes, or until tortillas are heated through.Remove from the oven, then serve individual enchiladas drizzled with the remainder of the jalapeno cream sauce. You can also garnish with additional cilantro, cheese, and/or sour cream.To Make Jalapeno Cream Sauce:Melt the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the flour, whisking until golden and bubbly, about 2-3 minutes. Slowly whisk the broth into the flour mixture. Stir in the sour cream, whisking if necessary to remove any lumps. Then add the minced jalapeno, and simmer until sauce is thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the fresh cilantro.

Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).2. Using a sharp paring knife, score the flat side of each chestnut with a big X, cutting through the outer shell and inner brown skin. Place the chestnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. While the chestnuts are still quite warm but cool enough to handle, peel them with a sharp paring knife, removing both the outer shell and the inner brown skin. Discard any chestnuts that look rotten. Set aside the chestnuts that are hard to peel and rewarm them in a 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) oven; or place them on a paper towel and rewarm in a microwave for 45 seconds on high, repeating if necessary.3. Cut the roasted chestnuts in half and set aside. Lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).4. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the wild rice, chicken stock, water, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover partially, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the wild rice is tender, about 40 minutes. (Not all of the liquid will be absorbed.)5. In a small bowl, combine the cranberries and apricots, add hot water to cover, and allow to plump for 20 minutes. Drain and reserve.6. In a 12-inch saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter and swirl to coat the bottom. Add the celery, carrots, and onion and saute until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme, sage, and parsley and saute for 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat.7. When the wild rice is tender, drain it in a sieve and add it to the sauteed vegetables. Add the reserved chestnuts, cranberries, and apricots and stir to combine. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning.8. Use the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to grease an oven-to-table casserole. Spoon the wild rice into the casserole and cover with aluminum foil. (The wild rice can be made up to this point 1 day in advance, cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking, and increase the baking time from 20 minutes to 40 minutes to ensure it is heated through.)9. Twenty minutes before serving, bake the wild rice until heated through, then serve directly from the casserole.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/wild-rice-with-roasted-chestnuts-and-cranberries-598103", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/banana-dutch-baby-pancake-735348.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 35, "id": 735348, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Banana Dutch Baby Pancake", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup smashed bananas (about 2 large bananas), plus 1 banana, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "bananas", "metaInformation": ["large", "smashed", "sliced", "( 2 bananas)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9040, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 1230, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs, separated", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["separated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Maple syrup, for serving", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": ["for serving"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19911, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup pecan halves", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "pecan halves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 12142, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.25, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 47.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/katie-lee/banana-dutch-baby-pancake.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 15, "aggregateLikes": 1316, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-low heat.

                                             Place the dried mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups very hot water. Set aside and let the mushrooms soften.Place the carrots, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse the vegetables until finely chopped but still chunky. Place the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped vegetables, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper and cook until tender, about 6 minutes.  Strain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the porcini mushroom liquid. Add the porcini mushrooms, fresh mushrooms, and tomato paste and continue cooking, stirring to dissolve the tomato paste, until the mushrooms are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the porcini mushroom liquid and red wine. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and let the mixture simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add mascarpone cheese and stir just until the cheese is incorporated.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add to the vegetable mixture. Add some of the reserved pasta cooking liquid, if necessary, to moisten the sauce. Toss with Parmesan and serve.

Blend until smooth, scraping sides as you go. Cover and refrigerate 1-2 hours. (I skipped the refrigeration and just strain out any lumps.)To fry crepes, heat a skillet over medium high heat. Be sure to choose one that holds heat well that you can hold comfortably with one hand. Cast iron is great for this. (I have a special non-stick crepe pan.) Pour in about \u00bd teaspoon oil and swirl to coat bottom of pan. Hold the pan up off the heat and pour a small stream of batter into the hot pan with one hand while simultaneously rotating the pan with your other hand to cover the batter evenly across the bottom. Continue rotating the pan until the batter is evenly coated. Fry until golden brown spots form on the bottom {about 20 seconds}. Flip and cook the other side another 15 seconds and remove to a plate. It might take you a few tries to get the technique down, but once you get it, you\u2019ll be a pro. Add in a few dribbles of oil as needed, usually after every 3 or 4 crepes.

                                   Make Lemon Curd:In a medium, non-reactive saucepan, combine the lemon juice and butter, place over medium-high heat, and heat to just under a boil. Meanwhile, in a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly whisk in the sugar until well combined. Remove the lemon juice mixture from the heat and gradually whisk a little of it into the sugar-egg mixture. Continue whisking the hot liquid into the sugar-egg mixture, a little at a time, until all of it has been incorporated.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan frequently to prevent the eggs from scrambling, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon thickly. To test, draw your finger along the back of the spoon; the curd should hold the trail for a second or two before it fills.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Remove the curd from the heat and strain through the sieve into a medium, heatproof bowl. Whisk in the vanilla and salt. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until cold before using. The curd can be stored for up to 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Make Mousse: In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and fresh and ground ginger and bring to just under a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and let the cream sit for about 1 hour to infuse with the ginger. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least overnight or up to 4 days.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            When you are ready to serve the mousse, strain the chilled cream into the bowl of the stand mixer or into a large bowl if using a handheld mixer. Whip the cream on medium speed until it holds a stiff peak. Then, using a rubber spatula, fold the lemon curd into the whipped cream just until fully incorporated.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Divide the mousse equally among serving bowls and top with the candied ginger.

When the skillet is hot, but not smoking (if it starts to smoke, turn heat down a bit and wait 5 minutes before adding the veggies) add the onions and red and orange peppers. Stir fry the peppers for 3-5 minutes, until they just begin to soften. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Keep warm by covering the plate with foil.Add another tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Add the chicken and brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Once the chicken is browned all over add the the enchilada sauce, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic and onion powder and bring everything to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and simmer the chicken in the sauce for 10-15 minutes or until cooked through and shreds easily.Meanwhile, make the polenta. Pour the chicken broth and milk into a medium size saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and slowly whisk in the polenta. Cook, stirring frequently, until the polenta is soft and thick, about 15 to 20 minutes. Keep warm and then just before serving, stir in the cheddar cheese and butter, season with salt and pepper. If the polenta seems a little thick you can add a tablespoon of butter or extra milk.When the chicken is done cooking remove the chicken from the heat and shred the chicken with 2 forks right in the sauce. If your peppers have cooled off too much I would toss them with the chicken to get them warm again. Toss in the black beans until warmed through.To assemble the bowls, add a nice serving of polenta to each bowl. Top with the peppers and saucy chicken.

Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans and line a cupcake pan with 6 liners (you're going to have 6 cupcakes to munch on along with your cake!)2. In a large bowl, whisk together cake mix, flour, sugar and salt. Add remaining ingredients and beat with hand mixer for 2 minutes, or until well blended.3. Scoop the batter into 6 cupcake liners 3/4-full.  Divide the remaining batter into the prepared round pans. Bake the cupcakes for about 25 minutes, and bake the cake rounds about 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then remove the cake layers to a wire rack to cool completely.4.  When the cake is cool, you're ready to assemble.  Place one layer on a serving plate, and tuck strips of waxed paper underneath the sides of the cake.  5.  Prepare the frosting:  In a large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low speed until blended. Increase speed to medium, and slowly add milk and vanilla, beating until smooth.  Microwave chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl at MEDIUM 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until melted and smooth, stirring at 30 second intervals. Gradually add melted chocolate to mixture; beat until blended and smooth.6.  Frost the 1st cake layer.  Set the 2nd layer on top of the first. Frost the 2nd layer and along the sides of the cake too.  Stick Kit Kat's to the sides of the cake, leaving a very small space in between each Kit Kat (1/4-inch).  Wrap a bow around the cake, securing the Kit Kat's.  Fill the top of the cake with M&M's.  Pull out the strips of waxed paper and discard.  Use any extra frosting to frost your 6 extra cupcakes.7.  If you refrigerate the cake for a couple of hours or so, it will be much easier to cut and serve.

They make great breakfast sausage patties.Season the roast with salt and pepper.Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the roast in the Dutch oven and brown on all sides. Transfer browned roast to a plate.Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and becoming translucent, about 5 minutes.Add wine, orange, lemon, and lime juices.

Pulse the graham crackers and the remaining 4 tablespoons toasted coconut in a food processor until the crackers are broken down into coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses. Process the mixture to evenly fine crumbs, about 12 seconds more. Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl and stir in the sugar to combine; add the melted butter and toss with a fork until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Empty the crumb mixture into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Press the crumbs evenly into the bottom and up the sides, forming a crust. Bake the crust until deep golden brown and fragrant, about 22 minutes. Cool the crust on a wire rack while making the filling.3. Make the Filling: Bring the coconut milk, whole milk, shredded coconut, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar. When the mixture reaches a simmer, whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl to break them up, then whisk in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and cornstarch until well combined and no lumps remain. Gradually whisk the simmering liquid into the yolk mixture to temper it, then return the mixture to the saucepan, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly, until 3 or 4 bubbles burst on the surface and the mixture is thickened, about 30 seconds. Off the heat, whisk in the vanilla and butter. Pour the filling into the cooled crust, press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling and refrigerate until the filling is cold and firm, at least 3 hours.4. Make the Whipped Cream Topping: When ready to serve, beat the cream and sugar in the chilled bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed to soft peaks; add the rum and vanilla. Continue to beat to barely stiff peaks. Spread or pipe the whipped  cream over the chilled filling. Sprinkle the reserved 1 tablespoon toasted coconut over the whipped cream and serve.

Most likely it will be clean though.2) Use a sharp knife to slice through the skin of the pork belly. Make slices 1/2 inch apart on the pork belly going in both directions. Try not to cut all the way down to the meat of the belly. They should be shallow scores.3) Rub the pork belly with sesame oil and season well with salt and pepper.4) Roast the pork belly at 500 degrees, skin side up, for 20 minutes. Then turn the heat down to 325 and roast for another 20 minutes. The pork belly should reach 170 degrees internally when it is done. Depending on the thickness of your belly, your roast time might vary.5) While pork is roasting, whisk together glaze ingredients. Set some aside for a sauce later.6) When pork is done roasting, it should be crispy on top and a lot of fat will have rendered out. Baste pork belly with the glaze. Return to oven and bake for another 10 minutes. Glaze the belly once more when you take it out. 7) Let the pork rest for a few minutes when it comes out and then slice it into 1/4 inch slices.8) Add a few slices of pork to a slider bun (toasted is best). Drizzle with a few drops of reserved sauce and top with the veggie topping.Serve immediately!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pork-belly-sliders-536369", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 80, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lemons for Lulu", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Coconut-Pecan-Pie-Bars-620501.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 620501, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Coconut Pecan Pie Bars", "preparationMinutes": 10, "creditText": "Lemons for Lulu", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 \u00bd cup Karo corn syrup", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "corn syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19350, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup chopped pecans", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "pecans", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12142, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semisweet chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10019903, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup shredded coconut", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "shredded coconut", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12108, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 25.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.lemonsforlulu.com/coconut-pecan-pie-bars/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "aggregateLikes": 209, "instructions": "Sift together the flour and the powdered sugar.

Special equipment: two 8-by-8-inch baking dishesAdd 1 cup of the flour to each baking dish. Set one aside for your dredging station. In the other add the spice blend, lemon zest and a nice pinch of salt, and whisk. Slowly stir in the beer until the batter thickens to a pancake consistency. If there is a sip of beer leftover, don't waste it, drink it! Rest the batter for 5 minutes.Fill a large pot 3- to 4-inches deep with oil and heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 350 degrees F. To fry, first dredge the asparagus in the flour, then shake off lightly and run through the batter. Immediately and gently lower the asparagus into the oil. Fry until the batter is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cook in batches to avoid overloading the pot, which reduces the overall temperature of the oil. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat for the remaining asparagus. Serve warm with the chilled Moroccan Spice Dip.                                                Moroccan Spice Dip:                                        In a medium bowl stir together the mayonnaise, onion pulp, parsley, sour cream, lemon juice and spice blend. Taste the dip and season with a pinch of salt, if needed. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Yield: 3/4 cup.                                                            Zest the lemon before you juice it and set the zest aside for the dip, cool? Ok, let's cook!Can't find a Moroccan spice blend? Think about creating your own.

After 3 mins, add the courgettes and garlic and continue to fry until the courgette has softened and turned bright green. Stir in 2/3 of both the ricotta and the cheddar, then season to taste. Heat the tomato sauce in the microwave for 2 mins on High until hot.In a large baking dish, layer up the lasagne, starting with half the courgette mix, then pasta, then tomato sauce. Repeat, top with blobs of the remaining ricotta, then scatter with the rest of the cheddar.

Grease (shortening works better than butter in this case) and flour a standard 12-cup capacity bundt pan or spray with baking spray.In a bowl, sift together flour, cake flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside.In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.In a separate small bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until smooth and incorporated.Add 1/3 of dry ingredients to mixing bowl and mix on low speed until almost incorporated. Add half of yogurt mixture and mix to combine. Repeat with another 1/3 of dry ingredients, remaining yogurt mixture, and ending with remaining dry ingredients, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until just incorporated (do not overmix).Pour batter into prepared baking pan and bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the thickest part of the cake comes out clean.Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then invert onto a plate or serving platter and let cool upside-down for another 10 minutes. The cake should release itself, and you should be able to pull the pan off cleanly at this point. Let cool to room temperature before glazing.To make glaze, in a microwave-safe bowl or 4-cup capacity glass measuring cup, whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice. Add lemon zest butter, and salt and microwave for 15 to 20 seconds until butter is just melted. Stir until smooth. If you prefer a thinner glaze use it immediately, otherwise let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes or until slightly thickened. Drizzle over top of cooled bundt cake, then slice and serve. Cake is best served the day it is made, but will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/greek-yogurt-meyer-lemon-bundt-cake-721234",

Place cold pizza stone or baking sheet pan in oven to preheat. Allow dough to come to room temperature while you are preparing the balsamic glaze, about 30 minutes.Stir balsamic vinegar and honey together in a small saut\u00e9 pan and place over medium high heat. Bring mixture to a boil, and then reduce heat to low. Keep checking the sauce, and stir every few minutes. Simmer until the vinegar mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, or the sauce can coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Set the balsamic reduction aside to cool but keep at room temperature. You want the sauce to be easily drizzled on the pizza, yet not be runny. The sauce will thicken once cooled so do not over reduce! You can test this by drizzling a small amount on a plate and see how thick the sauce is when it has cooled. You can always add a small amount of water to thin the sauce once cooled if needed so it can be drizzled on the pizza. Lightly flour your work surface and using your rolling pin, roll outward from the center of the dough until you have created a circular shaped crust, about 10-12 inches in diameter. Remove the pre-heated pan or pizza stone from the oven, placing on a metal cooling rack. Sprinkle a thin layer of cornmeal and flour on the pan, and then carefully transfer the dough to the preheated pan. Be careful, the pan will be very hot!Quickly brush a thin layer of olive oil on the crust, and then lightly sprinkle with salt.Spread the mozzarella evenly over the dough, leaving an inch border for the crust.
