Scoop into a container and freeze until firm.Allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften up, prior to serving.For the Cones:Heat your waffle cone iron on a medium-low setting.Microwave your butter in a small bowl until melted. Add in the chocolate chips and stir until melted and smooth. (You can zap them in 10-second increments if you cant get them to melt completely). Allow to cool a bit.In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and salt until mixed and foamy. Add in the chocolate mixture and whisk to combine. Add in the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract and whisk until the batter comes together.Drop 2 tablespoon-sized mounds into the center of your heated waffle iron, close, and cook for 90 seconds. Carefully remove, and immediately form around the rolling cone.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-peanut-butter-ice-cream-612496", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Food Doodles", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/No-Bake-Vegan-Peanut-Butter-Chewies-484860.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 484860, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "No Bake Vegan Peanut Butter Chewies", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 23.37, "creditText": "Food Doodles", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tbsp maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19911, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00be C Medjool dates, pits removed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "medjool dates", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dates.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9421, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd C natural peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "peanut butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.5, "id": 16098, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc C whole peanuts", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "peanuts", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanuts.png", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.25, "id": 16091, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1 generous pinch sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea-salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc C chocolate chips or roughly chopped dark chocolate bar", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "dark chocolate bar", "metaInformation": ["dark", "roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-chocolate.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19081, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 42.0, "sourceUrl": "http://fooddoodles.com/2012/11/29/raw-peanut-butter-cookies/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}], "step": "In a food processor, process the dates until they form a \"dough\".Turn the food processor off, break up the dough using a spoon, and then add the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and sea salt.

Bring to a boil and cook until the grits are thickened and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold in the cheese. Pour the grits into the prepared pan and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.Using a round cutter or a knife, cut the grits into 2 1/2-inch cakes.In a large skillet, heat the oil to a shimmer and add the cakes. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.                                                Corn Salsa:                                        In a medium skillet over high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the corn and cook until beginning to caramelize, about 4 minutes. Add the salsa and enough broth, starting with a 1/4 cup, to make it thick yet pourable. Serve warm.

You can heat up the milk in a saucepan, or just pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  Put the milk, yeast, egg, and 1 cup of flour in your stand mixer's bowl.  Mix the ingredients with a spatula until all is blended.  Sprinkle over the other cup of flour to cover the sponge, and let it rest uncovered for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, there should be cracks in the flour. The cracks let you know that the yeast is working its magic!Good, we are done with the sponge.  Now, what's the deal with the sponge?  It adds a deep flavor and a lovely texture to the bread, and is considered the equivalent of adding another rise to the bread. Now we will turn it into a dough.Add the sugar, salt, eggs, and 1 cup (5 oz) of your flour to the sponge.  Put the bowl in your stand mixer, and using the dough hook, mix on low for 1 minute, until the dough starts to come together.  With the mixer still running on low, add in the remaining 2.5 oz of flour (1/2 cup).  When the flour has been incorporated, bump the speed up to medium, and mix for 15 minutes.  After 10 minutes have passed, the dough should be slapping itself against the side of the bowl.  If it's not, add 3 tbsp more of flour.  Make sure you don't skimp on kneading the dough for 15 minutes.Bash out the butter with a bench scraper on a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap so it's soft and pliable (but not melted or greasy), and turn your mixer down to medium low.  Add the butter a couple tbsp at a time, waiting until each installment of butter is absorbed before adding the next.  And don't be worried if your butter has a hard time incorporating into the dough.  It will be fine.  When all the butter has been added, bump the speed up to medium high for a minute, then reduce to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes.  The dough should be slapping the bowl again by the end.  The dough will be soft and sticky, and may cling a little bit to the sides of the bowl.Butter a large bowl (I did a 5 qt bowl), and transfer the dough to that bowl, covering the top tightly with plastic wrap.  Let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours, until it has doubled in size.Since yeast tends to clump up, we want to redistribute the yeast.  However, we don't want to deflate the dough too much.  So very gently, with a spatula, turn the dough upside down and around to redistribute the yeast a little bit.  It's fine if it deflates a little bit, just don't purposely bash it down.  Cover again with plastic wrap and let it rise in the refrigerator for 7 hours (you could do as short as 4 hours if it rises enough, but longer rising means more flavor, so it's always best to be patient with bread.  Believe me, I am an impatient lady, so I know it's hard lol).With a sharp knife, gently slice your dough into 3 sections. Cut each section into 6 pieces.  You may gently roll those pieces into balls, but I chose to leave them sort of square.  Place 6 balls in each loaf pan, and cover with plastic wrap.  Let it rise for 2 hours.When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, and bake for about 30 minutes, until the interior is 200 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.

Nothing to be ashamed of, I use this option all the time when I don\u2019t have time to do anything more then dump everything in the slow cooker and walk away. My favorite salsa verdes are from Herdez and Frontera.Make it creamy! Want a creamier chicken, add 4 oz. reduced fat cream cheese or 3/4 cup reduced fat sour cream after shredding the chicken for a creamy version that is out of this world delicious. The cream cheese option adds 40 calories and 1 PointsPlus\u00ae per serving. The sour cream adds 31 calories and 1 PointsPlus\u00ae per serving", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sunday-slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken-510378", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main
