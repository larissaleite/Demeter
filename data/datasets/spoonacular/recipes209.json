Add the butter (you\u2019ll need to softened it slightly) and peanut butter and beat for several minutes on medium-high speed until very smooth and creamy. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl. Reduce sped to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture just until incorporated.3. Scrape the dough into a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.4. Press the dough evenly into the tart pan. (It is a little more challenging, but faster and neater to roll the dough out between sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/16 to 1/8 inch thickness and 11 1/2 inches in diameter. Remove one piece of plastic, invert the dough into the tart pan, and gently ease the edge of the dough inside the pan so that the sharp top surface does not cut it off.) Use a piece of plastic wrap to gently and evenly press the dough into the pan, pressing it against the sides. If the dough softens and sticks, refrigerate it until the plastic wrap doesn\u2019t stick. If the dough tears, simply press it together or use the scraps to press into any empty areas. Cover the tart pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 week. (You can wrap the unbaked crust well and freeze it for up to 3 months.)5. Bake the tart shell, without weights, in a preheated 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden. It will puff at first and then settle down toward the end of baking. The sides will be soft but spring back when touched gently with a finger. Cool on a wire rack.(Because I\u2019m obsessive, I used a rocks glass that has a flat bottom and straight sides and press it into the crease of the crust to make a clean 90-degree angle.\u2013David)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sweet-peanut-butter-cookie-tart-crust-599376", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 40, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Baking Heart", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Great-Food-Blogger-Cookie-Swap-2013--Red-Velvet-Blossoms-508553.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 508553, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "The Great Food Blogger Cookie Swap 2013 \u2013 Red Velvet Blossoms", "pricePerServing": 29.62, "creditText": "My Baking Heart", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp apple cider vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "apple cider vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2048, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "24 Candy Cane Hershey's Kisses", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "candy cane", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/candy-canes.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 24.0, "id": 93759, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 lg egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 c all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "3 tsp liquid red food coloring", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "food coloring", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/food-coloring.png", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 3.0, "id": 10711111, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "3/4 c granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19165, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 4513, "unit": "c"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 10.0, "sourceUrl": "http://mybakingheart.com/2013/12/11/the-great-food-blogger-cookie-swap-2013-red-velvet-blossoms/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg", "id": 404770, "name": "baking paper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.In a small bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, liquid food coloring, vinegar and vanilla extract, whisking until well combined.

Mix in the lemon zest, lemon oil, and vodka. Using a wooden spoon or the hand mixer at low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, mixing well. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.3. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Butter a baking sheet and dust it lightly with cornmeal, or line it with a silicone baking sheet.4. Divide the dough in half. Using your hands and working on a lightly floured surface, form each half into a log 9 inches long by 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them well apart (they will spread during baking). Bake the logs for 30 minutes. They will be very pale in color.5. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and reduce the oven heat to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). When the logs are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a cutting board and cut on the diagonal into slices 1/2 inch thick. Place the slices cut side down on the baking sheet.6. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake the cookies for 15 minutes. Turn them over and continue baking until lightly browned, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lemon-biscotti-597574", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false,
