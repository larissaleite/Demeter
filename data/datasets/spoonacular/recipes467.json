Immediately, with the processor running, pour the hot milk through the feed tube, processing for 15 to 20 seconds, or until the chocolate is melted. Add the oil mixture and process for 5 to 10 seconds, until thoroughly blended. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes (the chocolate should not be warm when the cream is added).                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Beat the cream until it holds a very soft shape (not even close to stiff). Fold one-third of the cream into the chocolate to lighten it. Fold in the remaining cream just until blended. Immediately divide the mousse among the dessert glasses. Refrigerate until serving. The mousse keeps for 2 days in the refrigerator. Grind a little black pepper over each serving, if desired.Tip: For the smoothest possible mousse, stop folding the moment the cream is incorporated into the chocolate, and immediately scoop it into the glasses.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/food-processor-chocolate-mousse-205632", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Vegetarian Times", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/classic-chestnut-soup-with-marsala-mushrooms-759350.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 759350, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Classic Chestnut Soup with Marsala Mushrooms", "pricePerServing": 621.02, "creditText": "Vegetarian Times", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 bay leaf", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "bay leaf", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bay-leaves.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2004, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 celery stalk, diced (\u00bd cup)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "celery stalk", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11143, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "8 oz. button or cremini mushrooms, stemmed and sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cremini mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["stemmed", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 11266, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbs. chopped fresh thyme or 1 tsp. dried thyme", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh thyme", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "Tb", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2049, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbs. finely chopped fresh thyme leaves for garnish, optional", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh thyme leaves", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "finely chopped", "for garnish, optional"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbs", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2049, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "1 clove garlic, minced (1 tsp.)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc tsp. ground allspice", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground allspice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/allspice-ground.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2001, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbs.
