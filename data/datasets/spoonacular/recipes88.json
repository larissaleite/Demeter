"After peeling and slicing the eggplant into 15 equal slices, lay them flat on your cutting board and sprinkle both sides with salt.  (Don\u2019t worry about over salting as it will get washed off later; this salting process draws out the bitterness of the eggplant.)  Allow the slices to sit for 1 \u00bd to up to 2 hours at room temperature. Put the slices in a strainer and wash off the salt and the bitter liquid; pat the slices dry with paper towels.  Lay out three large bowls.  Place flour, salt and pepper in the first and stir.  Place eggs and milk in the second and whisk well. Place the seasoned bread crumbs in the third.  Have a plate at the end of the row to collect the breaded slices.Dip each slice of eggplant in flour and shake and tap off excess.  Then dip in egg wash and finally in bread crumbs \u2013 coating both sides with all steps.  Place on collection plate.  Repeat until all eggplant is breaded.In a 14\u201d skillet, heat the oil to 350 degrees.  (Using a candy thermometer is helpful to ensure you get to the correct temperature.)Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Once the oil is hot, cook the eggplant in three batches.  Cook for 1 to 1 \u00bd minutes on each side until golden brown.  Remove to paper towels to drain.  Lightly salt each slice as they come out of the hot oil.When you are done, you should have a collection of eggplant slices that are large, medium and small in diameter.  Separate them into three sizes with five in each pile.  Pour one cup of tomato sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan or baking dish. Place five large slices spread out into the bottom of the pan over the sauce.Sprinkle each slice with a teaspoon of Parmesan and a tablespoon of sauce. Cut Fontina into five portions and place a slice onto each eggplant circle. Then layer the medium slices on top of the Fontina. Cover each pile with another teaspoon of Parmesan, a tablespoon of tomato sauce and split the Romano between the five portions. Add final small slice on each of the five portions and top with a teaspoon of Parmesan on each and \u00bc cup of tomato sauce on each.  Divide the fresh mozzarella between the five portions and lay over the top.Insert a skewer or a tooth pick (without frills) into the center of each so they don\u2019t slide apart while baking. Cook your pasta according to package directions while eggplant is baking.Cover the pan or dish with a sheet of plastic wrap and a sheet of foil, shiny side facing the food. Seal tight around the edges and bake for 25 minutes.  Uncover and bake for 5 minutes more.

"weightWatcherSmartPoints": 17, "aggregateLikes": 2438, "instructions": "In a medium-size bowl, stir together the vegetable oil, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, and salt. Add the shrimp and toss to coat them in the marinade. Cover the bowl and let the shrimp marinate in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the dish. (Note: The citric acid in the lime juice can start to \u201ccook\u201d the shrimp after a while, so I don\u2019t recommend marinating the shrimp for longer than 30 minutes.) Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and stir it in the oil until it\u2019s fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add the black beans. Give the beans a rough mash with a potato masher (they should still be a bit chunky) and cook them for another minute or two until they\u2019re heated through. Take the pan off the heat and stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of water, until the beans are spreadable. Season the beans with coarse salt to taste and partially cover the pan to keep them warm. Toss all of the ingredients together in a medium-size bowl. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to combine. The salsa is best the day it\u2019s made, but it will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Heat the panini press to medium-high heat. Lightly brush a tortilla with vegetable oil and transfer it to the grill. Sprinkle the tortilla with a little salt and close the lid. Grill the tortilla until it\u2019s crisped and golden grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Keep the grill heated. Remove the shrimp from the marinade (discard the remaining marinade) and put half of them on the grill.

"instructions": "To make the cake: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla in a large measuring cup (or small bowl). In a large bowl (or the work bowl of a stand mixer) mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat in the butter, one piece at a time, until only pea-sized pieces remain. Pour in half of the buttermilk mixture and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.  Slowly add the remaining buttermilk mixture to the bowl and beat until incorporated, about 15 seconds.Divide batter between prepared pans and bake until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20-25 minutes. Cool the cakes for about 10 minutes, the turn out onto wire cooling racks. Allow them to cool off completely, about 1 hour.To make the frosting: Heat 8 tablespoons of butter, brown sugar, and salt in a large saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles appear around the edge of the pan, 4-8 minutes. Whisk in the cream and cook until a ring of bubbles reappears, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla.Allow frosting mixture to cool slightly (about 5 minutes), then transfer to a mixing bowl (or work bowl of a stand mixer). With an electric mixer on low speed, gradually add the powdered sugar until incorporated. Increase speed to medium, and beat until the frosting is pale brown and just ward, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 4 T of butter, one piece at a time, and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.To assemble the cake, Place one cake round on a cake stand or platter. Spread 3/4 cup of frosting over the cake, top with the second layer, then spread the remaining frosting all over the cake. Serve.Nat's Notes:1. I made this cake in a 9x13 pan and sliced it into two layers with a bread knife. Chilling the cake for a few hours makes dividing it into layers much easier.2. I added some toasted coconut around the edges of the cake for decoration and thought it added a nice texture.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/easy-caramel-cake-557074", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simple Nourished Living", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Slow-Cooker-Mashed-Sweet-Potatoes-524887.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 360, "id": 524887, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Slow Cooker Mashed Sweet Potatoes", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Simple Nourished Living", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1-1/2 tablespoons brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup fresh or frozen cranberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cranberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cranberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 9078, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup orange juice", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "orange juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9206, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground", "to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 5.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "cut into 1-inch pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11507, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 63.0, "sourceUrl": "http://simple-nourished-living.com/2013/11/slow-cooker-mashed-sweet-potatoes/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 140, "instructions": "Coat your slow cooker with nonstick spray.

Using a small paring knife, slice off this top and then the bottom, just enough to expose the pulp. Begin at the top, just where the pith (white part) meets the pulp and slice downward towards the bottom removing a 1 to 1 \u00bd inch section of peel. Try to cut away all of the pith but very little of the flesh, following the curve of the fruit as well as you can. It does take practice but it is not hard.Continue the process working around the fruit in 8 or so slices. Your peeled fruit will end up vaguely octagonal as you look at it from above.Take a look at your handiwork and carefully shave off any remaining pith.Next slice out each segment by cutting in towards the center of the fruit along the membranes/walls on either side of each segment. If you are unsure about this, take a good look at the fruit before you slice. You\u2019ll see white lines that mark the edges of each segment. Run your knife down one side between the flesh and the membrane, then the other side of the same segment. Remove the segment, placing it in a medium bowl. Repeat with the lemon.Add the shallot, chile, cilantro, lime zest and juice, oil, honey, and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper to the bowl with the citrus segments. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes, gently stirring occasionally.Fill a wok or large pot with 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil. Line bottom basket of a 10-inch, 2-tiered round bamboo steamer with parchment paper. (Alternatively, use two pots fitted with steamer inserts.) Season fish using remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer in bottom basket. Cover, and set over boiling water. Steam until fish is just barely cooked through, about 5 minutes. Put spinach into top basket, and set over bottom basket. Steam until spinach is bright green and just wilted and the fish is completely opaque and cooked, about 2 minutes more.Divide spinach among 4 plates. Top each with fish and \u00bd cup salsa.

melted. Add all but 1/4 cup of the onions, the celery and all but 2 tablespoons of the bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 6 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of the garlic, the thyme, rosemary, and parsley and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.When the vegetable mixture is cooled, transfer to a mixing bowl and add the eggs, mustard, 1/4 cup of the ketchup, 1 teaspoon of the Worcestershire sauce, and heavy cream and mix until thoroughly combined. Add the breadcrumbs, ground chuck, pork sausage, ground veal, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Transfer meat mixture to a 9 by 5 by 3-inch loaf pan and using your hands, form mixture into a loaf shape. Arrange the slices of bacon on the top of the meatloaf and set aside.In a small saucepan combine the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped onion, remaining 2 tablespoons of green pepper, remaining teaspoon of garlic, remaining 1/2 cup of ketchup, remaining 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, remaining 2 teaspoons of pepper, vinegar, and canned tomatoes and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.Pour the sauce over the uncooked meatloaf and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the bacon and sauce are slightly caramelized on the top of the meatloaf. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Slice and serve along with the Macaroni with 4 Cheeses.

water. Add the milk, butter, sugars, nutmeg, salt, eggs and orange peel and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes or until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough.

On a floured surface, roll out one portion into a 13-1/2-in. x 6-in. rectangle. With a sharp knife, cut dough into thirty-six 1-1/2-in. squares.                                                                                            Using a sharp knife and beginning at the bottom of the lower left square, make two 1-in. vertical cuts 1/2 in. apart. Braid the three attached strips; pinch ends to seal. Place on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining squares and the remaining dough. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 40 minutes.                                                                                            In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375\u00b0. Fry doughnuts, a few at a time, for 1 minute on each side or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels.                                                                                            In a large saucepan, combine glaze ingredients.

heat. Stir in the celery, scallions, potatoes and corn. Add the thyme, bay leaves, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in the flour until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in the milk, then cover and bring to a boil. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium low and gently simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat. Discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaves.Transfer one-third of the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth, then return to the pot. Return to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp and cook until opaque, about 4 minutes. Season with salt. If the soup is too thick, stir in up to 1 cup water. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with paprika.Per serving: Calories 394; Fat 8 g (Saturated 5 g); Cholesterol 193 mg; Sodium 658 mg; Carbohydrate 49 g; Fiber 8 g; Protein 32 gPhotograph by Antonis
