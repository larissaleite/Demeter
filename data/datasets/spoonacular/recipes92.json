Heat 3 inches of canola oil in a heavy pot to 375 degrees F.Add half the chicken wing parts to the oil and fry them until they're golden brown and fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the other half of the wing parts.Add the plum jelly to a bowl. Then stir in the soy sauce and rice wine vinegar. Add the brown sugar, ginger, red onions, garlic, red pepper flakes and hot peppers. Stir to combine, and then pour it into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the sauce until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Then turn off the heat.Place the wings in an ovenproof dish and pour the sauce over the top, reserving some sauce for serving. Toss to coat, and then bake in the oven for 15 minutes.Place the wings in dishes, and then spoon extra sauce over the top. Serve with cool vegetables to go with that delicious heat.

Process the flour, sugar, and salt together in a food processor until combined. Scatter the shortening over the top and process until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the top and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.2. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture. Stir and press the dough together, using a stiff rubber spatula, until the dough sticks together. If the dough does not come together, stir in the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.3. Divide the dough into 2 even pieces. Turn each piece of dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten each into a 3-inch disk. Wrap each piece tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before rolling out the dough, let it sit on the counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. (The wrapped dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let the dough thaw completely on the counter before rolling it out.)4. Roll out one disk of dough into a 9-inch circle on a lightly floured counter, then fit it into a 6-inch pie plate, letting the excess dough hang over the edge; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Roll out the other disk of dough into a 9-inch circle on a lightly floured counter, then transfer to a parchment paper\u2013lined plate; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.5. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Make the filling6. Meanwhile, toss the nectarines, raspberries, and 1/4 cup of the sugar together in a medium bowl, and let sit, tossing occasionally, until the fruit releases its juice, about 20 minutes.7. Drain the fruit thoroughly through a colander, reserving 1 tablespoon of the juice. In a medium bowl, toss the drained fruit, reserved juice, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt together until well combined. (If the fruit tastes tart, add up to 1 1/2 tablespoons more sugar.)8. Spread the fruit in the dough-lined pie plate, mounding it slightly in the middle. Following the photos, gently arrange the second piece of pie dough over the pie. Trim, fold, and crimp the edges, and cut 3 vent holes in the top. Brush the crust with the egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar.9. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and bake until the top crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C), rotate the baking sheet, and continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes longer.

Pour over oats and mix until all oats are moistened.Bake for 30 minutes, stirring and flipping every 10 minutes.

Generously season each side of the steaks with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature about 20 minutes before cooking.In a cast-iron (or other heavy-duty) skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. Add half of the shallots and saute until tender for a couple of minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the cooked mushrooms to a dish and set aside. Wipe the skillet clean.Heat another tablespoon of butter over high heat in the skillet. It will bubble and foam, and after it stops, add the steaks. Sear on each side for about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil.Reduce the heat to medium high. Add the remaining shallots and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the flame off and add the wine. Turn the flame back on to high, bring to boil and let reduce by half. Whisk in the remaining tablespoon of butter. Stir in the reserved mushrooms.Spoon the sauce over the steaks and serve.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl.

Remove from heat and set aside.In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together eggs, sugar, and vanilla until pale and creamy, about 8 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate mixture. Add dry ingredients and stir until just incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips.Drop batter using a small cookie scoop by the scant tablespoonful onto cookie sheet, leaving two inches of space between cookies. The batter will be somewhat loose at this point, but shouldn't be runny. It will thicken the longer it sits.Bake for 7 to 8 minutes or until tops are shiny and cracked. Like a brownie, you don't want to over bake these cookies. Remove from oven and let cool on cookie sheet for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.To dip, gently melt chocolate together with 1 tablespoon of shortening. You can use a microwave, heating on low power in short, 15 to 20 second bursts, or in a double boiler, setting the bowl over the simmering water and then removing it from the heat. The residual heat should be enough to melt the chocolate without overheating it. If you can melt the chocolate ever so gently, and not allow the temperature to exceed 88 degrees F, it will retain its original temper and will harden nice and shiny. Add more shortening as needed to thin out the chocolate to a dipping consistency, then dip half of each cookie into the melted chocolate. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and top with sprinkles, if desired.Cookies are best enjoyed within a day or two but will keep, covered in an airtight container, for up to a week.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-dipped-brownie-cookies-494389", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 36, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eating Well", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/chicken-blueberry-pasta-salad-696061.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 696061, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chicken & Blueberry Pasta Salad", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Eating Well", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup fresh blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9050, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "feta cheese", "metaInformation": ["crumbled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1019, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh thyme", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2049, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces whole-wheat fusilli or radiatore", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "whole-wheat fusilli", "metaInformation": ["whole-wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 99181, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons lime juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9160, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon freshly grated lime zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime zest", "metaInformation": ["freshly grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lime.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1009159, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "low sodium chicken broth", "metaInformation": ["reduced-sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 6970, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shallot", "metaInformation": ["large", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11677, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, trimmed of fat", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breast", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless", "trimmed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1055062, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 61.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/chicken_blueberry_pasta_salad.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 1684, "instructions": "Place chicken in a skillet or saucepan and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil.

Make Tamale Masa:Warm the coconut cream and condensed milk in a saucepan over low heat. Set aside. Place butter in a mixer and mix until creamy. Add vanilla, masa harina, baking powder, salt, and warm coconut cream and condensed milk. Mix until well combined. Spread Masa:Place the wide end of the husk on the palm of your hand; narrow end is at the top. Starting at the middle of the husk spread 2 tablespoons of the masa with the back of a spoon in a rectangle or oval shape, using a downward motion towards the wide-bottom edge. Do not spread the masa to the ends; leave about a 2-inch border on the left and right sides of the husk.Fill Corn Husks:Spoon about 1 tablespoon of chopped pineapple down the center of the masa and then sprinkle with coconut. Fold over the ends of the husk until they meet and roll. Secure by tying thin strips of cornhusk to each end.Steam Tamales:Use a deep pot or tamale steamer to steam tamales. If using a tamale steamer fill with water up to the fill line. Set the tamale rack over the water. Stack tamales in the pot until filled. Cover pot with a tightly fitting lid. Set heat on high and bring to a boil, about 15 minutes. Lower heat and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Keep lid on tightly. To test if done, put one tamal on a plate and take off the cornhusk.

just combined, about 1 minute. While the blender is still running, slowly stream in the melted butter through the top hole until the sauce thickens, about 15 seconds. Adjust the seasoning with more lemon juice and some salt. Cover and keep warm (you can also transfer to a Thermos).Make the sandwiches: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter and let melt. Fry the ham until slightly charred, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Wipe the skillet clean and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When the butter is melted, fry the eggs over-easy, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side; season with salt and pepper.Toss the baby spinach, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Pile some of the dressed spinach on the bottom of each English muffin. Top with a piece of ham, then slide 1 fried egg on top of each. Ladle some of the hollandaze sauce on top, close the muffins and serve.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Jeff Mauro for Food Network

Place seven 4-ounce oven proof jars, ramekins, or custard cups in a large roasting pan, set aside.In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan combine sugar, water and 1/4 tsp salt (have heavy cream ready so you can immediately add it when caramel is ready, otherwise it will burn. Also I recommend working with a long handled whisk here since the mixture will steam and sputter). Whisk over medium-low heat stirring constantly until sugar has dissolved. Increase heat to medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Allow to boil, without stirring and using a pastry brush dipped in water as needed to brush down sugar crystals on sides of pan, until mixture turns an amber color, about 8 - 10 minutes. Once it reaches that color (immediately) carefully pour in heavy cream and milk while whisking (it will bubble vigorously and likely clump onto the whisk but will dissolve once returned to heat). Return to heat and cook, while constantly whisking, about 2 minutes longer or until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and let cool several minutes.In a large bowl stir egg yolks just to blend. Slowly pour cream mixture, while whisking, into egg yolks. Pour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a 4-cup glass liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout (if there are any bubbles/foam at the top of the mixture just press a piece of plastic over them to remove them as they'll stick to the plastic. It will give a pretty presentation in the end not to have the bubbles). Divide mixture evenly among cups in roasting pan.Pour enough hot water into roasting pan around cups to come halfway up the sides of the cups. Carefully place on oven rack in center of oven. Bake until custard edges are set but center still jiggles slightly when shaken, about 40 minutes. Transfer cups to a wire rack and cool 30 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator and chill 4 hours. Sprinkle with Maldon just before serving. *I don't usually keep whole milk on hand so I simply replaced 1 Tbsp of the 1% milk I do have with 1 Tbsp heavy cream.Recipe source: adapted from BHG",

the pork ragu: (This can TOTALLY be done ahead!) Place the garlic, celery, onions and fennel in a food processor and puree to a coarse paste.Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and toss in the pureed veg. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat and season generously with salt and a sprinkey dink of crushed red pepper. Cook the veg until they start to get brown and form a crust on the bottom of the pan; be patient...this will take a little time. Scrape the crud off the bottom of the pan and let it re-form. Stay with it and DO NOT let it burn.Add the ground pork, sprinkle with salt and repeat this process. This takes patience...accept it and move on. THIS is where BIG flavors are formed.When the meat is nice and brown, add in the tomato paste, stir to combine and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the white wine and let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes.Toss in the pureed tomatoes, bay, cinnamon stick, thyme and 2 cups water. Taste and season with salt if needed. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, add more water and reduce again. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. Turn off the heat and use immediately or store for future use.For the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, toss the butternut squash slices with olive oil and salt. Lay the squash slices on sheet trays and bake until the squash is tender but still holds its shape, about 20 minutes. Repeat until all the squash is roasted.Coat a large saute pan with olive oil, toss in 2 of the garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden and very aromatic, remove it and toss it in the \"thank you for coming bowl\". Add half of the mushrooms to the pan, season with salt and cook until they are soft and wilted. Remove from the pan and reserve. Repeat this whole process--starting with the oil and garlic--with the remaining mushrooms, followed by the spinach in 2 batches. Drain and cool the cooked spinach in a colander or mesh strainer.In a large bowl combine the ricotta and parsley.To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a ladleful of the pork ragu in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spread it around to LIGHTLY cover the bottom of the dish.Arrange an even layer of the roasted squash on top of the ragu; be sure the squash completely covers the surface of the baking dish--this acts as the \"pasta\". Cover the squash layer generously with more ragu. Spoon 1-tablespoon scoops of the ricotta mixture over the ragu. Arrange an even layer of spinach and mushrooms over the ricotta.  Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan. Lay another layer of squash over the Parmesan and repeat the process until the baking dish is full, ending with a top layer of squash topped with a little ragu and Parmesan.Cover the baking dish with foil, place on a sheet tray and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

"vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "aggregateLikes": 72, "instructions": "Put the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk together. Add the olive oil and eggs and mix together until it comes together into a ball. Attach the bowl to a mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead until the dough is smooth and satiny. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest while you make the filling.Blanch the arugula by putting it in a glass container, adding about a tablespoon of water, covering with another glass plate, and microwaving for 1 minute. Remove the lid, let it cool enough to handle, then squeeze as much moisture out of it as you can.Heat a small saute pan and add the olive oil. Saute the shallots, garlic and shiitake mushrooms until the mushrooms have given up most of their moisture (about 10-15 minutes). Let this mixture cool down to room temperature.Add the arugula, onion mixture, marscapone, ricotta, tahini, soy sauce and salt to a food processor and process until smooth. Add the water chestnuts and pulse a few times to roughly chop them up (there should still be chunks). Prepare an egg wash by whisking together an egg with 1 tablespoon of water.Heat the balsamic vinegar, honey and demi-glace in your smallest sauce pan. Once the demi-glace has disolved and the mixture is thick and bubbly, it's ready (this shouldn't take long). I poured the mixture into a mini squeeze bottle to make the dots, but you can also just pour a bit on the plate and smear it with a spoon, or just drizzle it on top of the raviolis.Cut off a quarter of the dough and flatten it out on a floured surface using your hands or a rolling pin, then pass it through the rollers of a pasta maker starting from the thickest setting and working your way down to a thinnest, passing the dough through at least 2 times per setting. If the dough starts to stick, just dust some flour on it. Lay the dough out on a long flat floured surface then repeat with another quarter of dough.When your second sheet is done, line the sheets up and trim off the ends so they are exactly the same length. Place 1 tablespoon of filling a few inches apart, leaving room around the edges of the dough so you can seal the raviolis. Be careful not to overcrowd the dough or you'll have a hard time sealing the raviolis properly. Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash all around the filling. Drape the other piece of dough over the first piece and use your fingers to start sealing each ravioli starting from one end. It's crucial that there aren't any air pockets with the filling as the air will expand while cooking and your ravioli will burst. The best way to do this is to seal one side, then use two fingers to trace the outline of the filling starting fromt he side that's sealed, then seal off the other side, and you should be good.I used a round cookie cutter that's 1/4\" bigger than the filling mound on both sides, but you can also cut your ravioli with a knife. If you are freezing the ravioli, place them on a floured cookie sheet and freeze them. Once they are frozen you can put them in a ziplock bag, but they will stick together if you don't freeze them separately first.To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, then turn down the heat to maintain a gentle boil. If you have a very large pot you can cook all 18 at the same time, but I just cooked them in two batches.
