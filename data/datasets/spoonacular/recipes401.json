Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not brown).  3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate.  When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up.  Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.4 Turn the heat to low.  Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time.  Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper.  Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick.

two kitchen towels with a stack of heavy books on top for an hour. Once the tofu is dry, slice it down the side in the middle lengthwise and then slice it perpendicular to that in one inch intervals. You should have 12 rectangular pieces at this point. Slice those into one inch squares so that there are 36 squares total. You might have less if you are using a smaller block of tofu. Alternatively, you can cut them into strips if thats what you prefer.Next combine the almond milk (or water) with 1/4 cup hot sauce and 2 tablespoons ground chia seed then set aside to thicken.
