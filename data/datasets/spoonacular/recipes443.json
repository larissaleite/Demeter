Add the chicken wings, seal, and toss until well coated with the flour mixture. Refrigerate chicken in the bag for at least 1 hour.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Whisk together the melted butter and hot sauce in a small bowl. Dip the wings into this mixture, and place back on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and crispy on the outside, about 45 minutes. Turn the wings over halfway during cooking so they cook evenly.Optionally, serve wings with dipping sauces such as ranch and/or bleu cheese dressing, and celery sticks.Enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Whisk to combine. Add olive oil and water. Knead on low speed just until dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead once more on low speed for 10 minutes. Dough should pull away from sides of bowl but stick to bottom.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Remove dough hook, cover top of mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 24. Meanwhile, make the sauce.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the Sauce: Heat olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until butter melts. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, sugar, and whole shallot. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until rich and thick, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool in fridge while dough rises.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Two hours before baking, remove dough from fridge. Generously grease the inside of a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with olive oil (about 3 tablespoons). Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Form into flat ball and transfer to baking sheet. Using your hands, coat the ball on all sides with olive oil. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic and let dough rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough should spread out .                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Carefully stretch and push the dough into the corners and edges of the pan. Cover loosely, and let rise for 1 hour longer. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. When dough has risen, gently dock center with finger tips and use your hands to create a risen ridge about 1-inch wide around the edge.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Spread sauce generously over dough, leaving the raised 1-inch edge un-sauced. Bake until edges are light golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes total, rotating pan once half way through baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.
