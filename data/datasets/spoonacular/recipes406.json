Let them cook over medium high heat until they are tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.When the milk mixture is warm (it will be frothy - careful not to scorch it), remove it from the heat and stir in the cheese until it's smooth.Once the vegetables are cooked, add them to the steak and toss to combine.Melt a little butter (I just rub the stick in the pan) in the same skillet you used for the steak and vegetables. Add one slice of sourdough bread. Top the bread with the steak and veggie mixture. Spoon the cheese sauce over the steak. Top with the second slice of bread.Turn the sandwich to grill the second side and repeat with the other 3 sandwiches.EAT.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
