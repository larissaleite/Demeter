"aggregateLikes": 16, "instructions": "For the brownies, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8\u00d78-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. Lightly grease with cooking spray and set aside.Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for one minute intervals, stirring in between, until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Set the mixture aside until it cools slightly (is warm to the touch not hot). It will look gritty but it will become smooth once the other ingredients are added. Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the flour and stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with the wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Spread evenly in the lined pan.Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges slightly moist with batter, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack and then chill in the refrigerator or freezer until thoroughly cold - this will help the brownies hold up well to the ice cream layer that's coming. For the ice cream layer, soften the ice cream to spreading consistency (leaving at room temperature for 15-20 minutes should do the trick), then spread an even layer across the chilled brownies. The ice cream layer should be about an inch thick. Put the pan in the freezer until very firm (1-2 hours). For the magic shell, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine the coconut oil and chocolate chips. It helps if the bowl is more tall than wide so that when you dip the bars, the chocolate mixture is deep and not super shallow. Microwave for one minute intervals at 50% power until the chocolate is melted. Stir the mixture until it is smooth. It will be fairly runny. Remove the pan of brownies from the freezer. Gently lift the foil handles and remove the ice cream layered brownies from the pan. Cut the browines in half. Then, working with one half at a time (you might want to return the other half to the freezer if your kitchen is overly warm), cut rectangle into long, thin bars, about 1-inch by 4-inches. You should end up with 8 or so bars per half. Repeat with the remaining half. It is best to put all the cut bars onto a tray or plate and keep them in the refrigerator while dipping so they stay as cold as possible. Place a baking rack over a sheet of parchment paper or waxed paper or even aluminum foil (to help with cleanup). Working one-by-one, gently hold the ice cream bar at the base of the brownie and dip it quickly into the chocolate shell mixture (tilt the bowl to help deepen the chocolate for easier dipping) until completely coated and place on the baking rack. Your hands will get messy but I promise it's worth it! Repeat the dipping process with each bar. After I dipped about 5-7 bars and the chocolate shell had hardened (it sets up very quickly, especially if your ice cream and brownie is very cold), I gently removed them from the cooling rack and put them in the freezer so the ice cream didn't melt and kept dipping the other bars that were waiting in the freezer. Make note that the chocolate shell mixture will want to stick to the baking rack so pry the eskimo bars carefully off the baking rack so the chocolate shell doesn't crack as you separate them from where the chocolate has hardened to the rack. When ready to serve, remove the eskimo bars from the freezer and let them sit at room temperature for 5-7 minutes. Warm the caramel sauce until it is runny and slightly warm but not overly hot (you don't want any burned fingers). Dip the eskimo bars in the caramel and enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/outrageous-eskimo-bars-568736", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Creative Culinary", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Great-Migration-Cocktail-with-Mariposa-Agave-Nectar-Liqueur-for--FridayCocktails-522868.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 1, "id": 522868, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "The Great Migration Cocktail with Mariposa Agave Nectar Liqueur for #FridayCocktails", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Creative Culinary", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "0.75 oz.

At least 24 hours prior to preparing the dish, rinse the cod well to remove any surface salt, then soak it in a large bowl with plenty of water, changing the water several times during the 24 hours. When ready to begin the recipe, drain and rinse the salt cod again.2. Fill a bowl with cold water and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, slip the cod into the pot, and cook until it flakes easily, about 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet. Remove the fish from water with a slotted spoon and place in the bowl of cold water to stop the cooking.3. When cool, remove the fish from the bowl, pat it dry with paper towels, and set aside.4. In a medium saucepan with high sides, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 365\u00b0F (185\u00b0C). Add the potato cubes and fry until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to paper towel to drain and set aside.5. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot.  Saute the onion, bell pepper, and bay leaves until the onions are glassy and soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Break the cod into large flakes and add it to the skillet. Add the chopped garlic and another 1/4 cup of olive oil and continue to cook until the onions are golden, making sure not to burn the garlic, about 3 minutes.6. Stir the fried potatoes and olives into the cod mixture until warmed through. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Remove the skillet from the heat and discard the bay leaves. Sprinkle the parsley over the cod mix and toss. Set aside.7. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Fry the eggs over easy, 2 to 4 minutes.8.

Heat a large skillet on medium low heat.  Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon.  Slowly fry, turning occasionally, until the bacon is browned on both sides, and if using strip bacon, much of the fat is rendered out (about 10 minutes).  Use tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.  Don't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).2 While the bacon is cooking, bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer. 3 Make the blender hollandaise. To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter.  Put 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color.  Turn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend. Taste for salt and acidity and add more salt or lemon juice to taste.Transfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm \u2013 but not hot \u2013 place on or near the stovetop. 4 Poach the eggs. Here is an easy method for poaching eggs.  Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.)  When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon.  Note that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them.  You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.5 As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins.  If you can\u2019t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl. 6 To assemble the eggs benedict, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you\u2019d like. Put a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/eggs-benedict-245360", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45,

"instructions": "for the graham crust:Toss the graham crumbs, milk powder, sugar, and salt with your hands in a medium bowl to evenly distribute your dry ingredients.Whisk the butter and heavy cream together. Add to the dry ingredients and toss again to evenly distribute. The butter will act as a glue, adhering to the dry ingredients and turning the mixture into a bunch of small clusters. The mixture should hold its shape if squeezed tightly in the palm of your hand. If it is not moist enough to do so, melt an additional 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and mix it in.Eat immediately, or deploy as directed in a recipe. The crust is easiest to mold just after mixing. Stored in an airtight container, graham crust will keep fresh for 1 week at room temperature for 1 month in the fridge or freezer.for the cheesecake filling:Combine the white chocolate and oil in a microwave-safe dish and gently melt the mixture on low for 30 to 60 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir the chocolate and oil together, working until the mixtures is glossy and smooth.Combine the cream cheese and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and stir together on medium-low speed for 2 to 3 minutes to blend. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.On low speed, slowly stream in the white chocolate mixture. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes, until it is fully incorporated into the cream cheese. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Add the peppermint extract, salt, and food coloring and paddle the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or just until it is smooth and leprechaun green. (You may need to scrape the bowl down once mid-mixing.) No point in making ahead - you don\u2019t have any use for it otherwise and it will make it trickier to swirl in later.for the brownie pie filling:Dump 1 1/4 cups graham crust into a 10-inch pie tin and set the remaining 1/4 cup to the side. With your fingers and the palms of your hands, press the crust firmly into the pie tin, covering the bottom and sides of the pan completely. Wrapped in plastic, the crust can be refrigerated or frozen for up to 2 weeks.Combine the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and gently melt them together on low for 30 to 50 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir them together, working until the mixture is glossy and smooth.Combine the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip together on high for 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy and pale yellow and has reached the ribbon state. (Detach your whisk, unk it into the whipped eggs, and wave it back and forth like a pendulum: the mixture should form a thickened, silky ribbon that falls and then disappears into the batter.) If the mixture does not form ribbons, continue whipping on high as needed.Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment. Dump the chocolate mixture into the eggs and briefly mix together on low, then increase the speed to medium and paddle the mixture for 1 minute, or until it is brown and completely homogeneous. If there are any dark streaks of chocolate, paddle for a few seconds longer, or as needed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and paddle on low speed for 45 to 60 seconds. There should be no clumps of dry ingredients. If there are any lumps, mix for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Stream in the heavy cream on low speed, mixing for 30 to 45 seconds, just until the batter has loosened up a little and the white streaks of cream are fully mixed in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Detach the paddle and remove the bowl from the mixer. Gently fold in the 45 g (1/4 cup) graham crust with a spatula. (These crumbs will add little bursts of flavor and texture into the pie filling.)for the mint glaze:Combine the white chocolate and oil in a microwave-safe dish and melt the chocolate on low for 20 to 30 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir the oil and chocolate together, working until the mixture is glossy and smooth. Stir in the peppermint extract.  (If you are using food coloring, stir it in here too.)to assemble the pie:Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.Pour the mint cheesecake filling into the prepared pie shell. Pour the brownie batter on top of it. Use the tip of a knife to swirl the batter and mint filling, teasing up streaks of the mint filling so they show through the brownie batter.Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips into a small ring in the center of the pie, leaving the bulls eye center empty. Sprinkle the mini marshmallows into a ring around the ring of chocolate chips.Bake the pie for 25 minutes. It should puff slightly on the edges but still be jiggly in the center. The mini chocolate chips will look as if they are beginning to melt, and the mini marshmallows should be evenly tanned. Leave the pie in the oven for an additional 3 to 4 minutes if this is not the case.Cool the pie completely before finishing it. (You can speed up the cooling process by carefully transferring the pie to the fridge or freezer directly out of the oven if you\u2019re in a hurry.Make sure your glaze is still warm to the touch. Dunk the tines of a fork into the warm glaze, then dangle the fork about 1 inch above the bull\u2019s eye center of the pie.Transfer the pie to the fridge so the mint glaze firms up before serving - which will happen as soon as it\u2019s cold, about 15 minutes. Wrapped in plastic, the pie will keep fresh in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/grasshopper-pie-552417",

Mix soy sauce, sherry and sugar in a bowl and add the chicken.  Let soak for 10 minutes.  Remove chicken and pat dry with paper towels.  Fry the shredded chicken in a little cooking oil on medium high heat to make it a little crispy and to bake in the seasoning.  Set aside. 2 Put 3/4 inch of high smoke point cooking oil (such as grapeseed oil, or peanut oil) into a small saucepan.  Heat on high heat until when you flick a drop or two of water into the oil it sizzles.  Take one bunch of the dried bean threads and gently break them up a bit.  Test the oil by putting one bean thread into the oil.  If the oil is hot enough, the bean thread will almost immediately sizzle and puff up.  That's when you know the oil is hot enough.  Working with a few bean threads at a time, put them in the hot oil.  As soon as they puff up, remove them carefully with tongs and place them on a paper towel to cool.  The paper towel helps remove any excess oil.  Set aside.3 Cut your green onions, shredding them lengthwise as shown.  Toast your chopped almonds, or chop your toasted almonds; toast your sesame seeds.  (Heat a thin skillet to medium high heat, add the seeds - or nuts, don't do them both together - stir frequently until they begin to brown, remove from heat, they will continue to cook.  Let cool to room temp.)4 Mix all of the sauce ingredients together, in the order listed.

"Combine the oyster sauce, Shaoxing, potato starch, soy sauce, white pepper and salt in a small bowl and whisk together.Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Add the sesame oil and ginger and fry until fragrant. Add the ground pork and stir-fry, using the edge of a spatula to break up the meat into little crumbs.When the meat is cooked, add the onion, carrot, celery, and shiitake mushrooms and continue stir-frying until the carrots are mostly cooked. Add the napa cabbage and glass noodles and continue stir-frying until the cabbage is mostly cooked. Add the sauce and stir-fry until there is no liquid left. Let this mixture cool.Make some glue by combing 3 tablespoons flour with 3 tablespoons water.Peel the wrappers and spread them out as pictured with about 1/2\" of the wrapper below showing. This makes it easy to paint glue on several wrappers at once. Spread the glue with a pastry bush along the top edges of the wrapper.Place about 1/3 cup of the room temperature filling about 2 inches above the bottom corner of the wrapper.Tightly roll the wrapper and filling half-way.Fold the left edge over right up against the edge of the filling, then fold the right edge over. The trick here is to taper your fold slightly so that the open flap is a little narrower than the bottom of the roll as this will create a good seal and prevent flaps of dough that will invite oil into your roll. It should look a bit like an open envelope at this point.Finish by continuing to roll until the flap seals itself against the roll.To make the sweet and sour sauce, whisk together the water, vinegar, sugar, ketchup, potato starch and salt in a small saucepan until there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly until your sauce has thickened.Prepare a paper towel lined rack. Pour about 2\" of vegetable oil into a heavy bottomed pot and heat to 320 degrees F.Fry the springrolls a few at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Turn them over frequently so that they brown evenly. When they reach an even tan color, transfer the spring rolls to your rack and allow them to drain.

Spread the fries out evenly between the two sheet pans, making sure they are in one single layer, spaced a bit apart. If they're all on top of each other and crowded, they will steam each other and never get brown.Bake the potato fries for 20 minutes*, then take them out and give them a good toss.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, applesauce and granulated sugar until well blended. Add in dry ingredients and mix until combine (batter should be slightly lumpy, don't over-mix). Pour half of the batter into a sandwich size ziploc bag and seal bag (I tried pouring all of it into a large ziploc and just found it was easier to work in two smaller batches). Brush preheated griddle generously with vegetable oil (I used a silicone baster and brushed the areas where the pancake batter would be poured. The vegetable oil is an important part of the \"fried\" doughnut flavor so that's why I stated \"generously\"). Cut about a 1 inch corner off the ziploc bag (while holding it with the tip pointing upward so the batter doesn't pour right out), then carefully pipe doughnut shapes onto oiled griddle*. Cook pancake until golden on bottom, then lift pancake with a spatula and brush griddle again with vegetable oil then carefully flip to opposite side. Cook opposite side until golden. Repeat process with remaining batter. Serve Doughnut Pancakes warm, with Doughnut Glaze Syrup and sprinkles of course =).*note: the first one will probably be a practice pancake, the second should look better once you get the feel for it. The batter will spread slightly as it cooks so keep that in mind when judging how large you keep the hole in the center of the circle. Also, after piping each pancake, return bag with the cut opening facing upright so batter doesn't continue to pour out. If you find it too difficult to get the shape you want you could just ladle (and slightly spread the batter so the centers aren't thicker) onto the griddle and do normal shaped pancakes then use a small circle cookie/fondant cutter and cut a circle through the center of the pancake after it's been cooked.Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once butter has melted, stir in powdered sugar, salt and milk. Whisk until sugar has dissolved completely then stir in baking soda and whisk for about 30 seconds until frothy. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Serve warm over Doughnut Pancakes.

Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm area to double in size, about 1  to 2 hours. Once doubled evenly divide dough in half and refrigerate one half for another time or double the topping recipe to make two 12 inch pizzas.Lightly grease a sheet of parchment paper with olive oil. Transfer one ball of dough to parchment and stretch it out by hand as much as possible. Lightly brush olive oil on another piece of parchment paper and place it on top of hand-flattened dough. Use a rolling pin and work from the middle of the dough outward to flatten dough to  inch thickness. Peel off top parchment paper.Note: Dough can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for up to three days.Assembly:If using pesto, evenly spread it on the crust with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, leaving  inch border. Top with 3 oz. goat cheese on top and layer with asparagus, soft boiled egg slices, mini heirloom tomatoes and remaining 1 oz .of goat cheese.Slide the pizza (with the parchment underneath) on to the hot pizza stone.
