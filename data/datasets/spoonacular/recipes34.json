Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin and set aside.2. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the nuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the nuts are the size of sesame seeds, about ten 1-second pulses. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the food processor bowl and transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and set aside.3. Return the bowl and metal blade to the food processor, add the flour, granulated sugar, and salt and process until combined, about five 1-second pulses. Sprinkle the butter evenly over the flour mixture and process until the butter is the size of oats, about eight 1-second pulses. Remove \u00bd cup of the flour-butter mixture and stir it with a fork into the reserved brown sugar mixture until combined to make the streusel. Set aside \u00be cup of the streusel for the muffin batter and the remaining portion for topping the muffins.4. Add the baking powder and baking soda to the remaining flour mixture in the food processor bowl and process until combined, about five 1-second pulses. Whisk together the sour cream, egg, and vanilla in a 1-cup glass measuring cup and add to the flour mixture. Process until the batter is just moistened, about five 1-second pulses. Add the remaining \u00be cup of the streusel to the flour mixture and process until the streusel is just distributed throughout the batter and the batter looks crumbly, about five 1-second pulses.5. Using a large spoon sprayed with nonstick cooking spray to prevent sticking, divide the batter among 12 muffin cups. Sprinkle with a scant tablespoon of streusel on top of each muffin, pressing lightly so that the streusel sinks slightly into the batter. Bake the muffins until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out with several crumbs clinging to it, about 18 minutes, rotating the pan from front to back halfway through the baking time.

Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool 10 minutes.In a small bowl or blender, combine 1 cup of full-fat coconut milk and 2 tablespoons of honey.Poke the cake using a fork or wooden skewer multiple times (I poked holes about -inch to 1 inch apart). Pour the coconut milk-honey mixture evenly over the whole cake, including the sides. Refrigerate at least 3 hours, overnight is better. If keeping the cake in a single layer, you can frost it after it has sat and soaked in the refrigerator. If making a layer cake, cut the cake in half to form two layers. Follow the instructions above for preparing the frosting.Place one (or two if extra frosting is desired) 14-ounce cans of coconut milk in the refrigerator and refrigerate overnight. When ready to make the frosting, open the cans and scoop out just the coconut cream (the super thick fleshy part at the top), reserving the coconut water for other recipes such as smoothies or oatmeal. Transfer the coconut cream to a mixing bowl.Add the remaining ingredients for the coconut frosting to the mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to beat until well-combined and fluffy. If the coconut cream is hard, add a small amount (2 to 3 tablespoons to start) of the coconut water in order to soften it up a bit. Add a small amount more as necessary, until a thick whipped cream forms. Refrigerate until ready to use - ideally, you'll prepare the frosting just before frosting the cake so that it doesn't become liquidy in the refrigerator.Spread the frosting over the cake, cut large hunks, and serve (Note: if making a layer cake, use half of the frosting to adhere the two layers and the remainder of the frosting to frost the top of the cake).", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Process, then pulse, scraping down the sides, if necessary, until the mixture begins to clump, 30 to 45 seconds (it will look crumbly). Measure out 1/2 cup of the mixture and combine in a bowl with the remaining 1/4 cup chopped nuts (or oats). Set aside for the topping.Preheat oven to 400F. Generously coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.To prepare fruit filling & assemble bars: Combine 3 cups cranberries, orange juice, sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is very thick, 4 to 5 minutes. (It may take up to 10 minutes to get a thick result if you start with frozen fruit.) Stir in the remaining 2 cups cranberries, orange zest, orange segments and 1 teaspoon vanilla.Transfer the dough to the prepared baking dish. Spread evenly and press firmly into the bottom to form a crust. Spread the fruit filling over the crust. Sprinkle the reserved topping over the filling.Bake the bars for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 and bake until the crust and topping are lightly brown, 25 to 30 minutes more. Let cool completely before cutting into bars, at least 1 1/2 hours.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cranberry-orange-fruit-bars-695324", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 165, "servings": 18, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "In Katrinas Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mini-Malted-Milk-Cheesecakes-587603.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 18, "id": 587603, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Mini Malted Milk Cheesecakes", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "In Katrinas Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 Tablespoons butter or margarine, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Tablespoons", "unitShort": "Tablespoons", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "Tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "3 packages (8oz each) PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "3 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 Cup graham cracker crumbs (about 6 sheets)", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "graham cracker crumbs", "metaInformation": ["( 6 sheets)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "Cupsheet", "unitShort": "Cupsheets", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10018617, "unit": "Cupsheets"}, {"originalString": "Malted Milk Candy Balls (or eggs)", "aisle": "Tea and Coffee", "name": "malted milk", "metaInformation": ["(or eggs)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-powdered.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 14311, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 Cup malted milk powder", "aisle": "Tea and Coffee", "name": "malted milk powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-powdered.jpg", "unitLong": "Cups", "unitShort": "Cup", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14311, "unit": "Cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 Cup plus 2 Tablespoons sugar, divided", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "Cups", "unitShort": "Cup", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "Cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Fresh whipped cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whipped cream", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whipped-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 1054, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 30.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.inkatrinaskitchen.com/2013/03/mini-malted-milk-cheesecakes.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 19, "aggregateLikes": 1975, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees and lightly grease a 12 cup mini cheesecake pan (or line a muffin tin with paper liners).Mix graham cracker crumbs with 2 Tablespoons sugar and butter; press onto bottoms of each prepared pan, set aside.Prepare the filling by beating cream cheese, remaining sugar, malted milk powder, and vanilla.

in a food processor until completely smooth.Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the pork in a single layer, season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, undisturbed, until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the pieces and cook until brown, about 1 minute more. Dust the meat with the chili powder, and add the tomato puree, sweet potatoes, chicken broth, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover and gently simmer until the meat is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the toppings: Chop the jalapenos, and whisk together with the yogurt in a small bowl. Shred the cabbage, cut the avocado into chunks and cut the lime into wedges.Ladle the stew into large, deep bowls. Top with the yogurt mixture, garnish with the cabbage, avocado, lime and cilantro and serve with the tortillas.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.

Rub a little olive oil over the stew meat pieces, carrots, and onions.  Place stock bones, stew meat or beef scraps, carrots and onions in a large, shallow roasting pan.  Roast in oven for about 45 minutes, turning the bones and meat pieces half-way through the cooking, until nicely browned.  If bones begin to char at all during this cooking process, lower the heat. They should brown, not burn.2 When the bones and meat are nicely browned, remove them and the vegetables and place them in a large (12 to 16 quart) stock pot.  Place the roasting pan on the stove-top on low heat (will cover 2 burners), pour 1/2 cup to a cup of hot water over the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up all of the browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Pour the browned bits and water into the stock pot.3 Add celery tops, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the stock pot.  Fill the stock pot with cold water, to 1 to 2 inches over the top of the bones.  Put the heat on high and bring the pot to a low simmer and then reduce the heat to low.  If you have a candy or meat thermometer, the temperature of the water should be between 180\u00b0 and 200\u00b0F (boiling is 212\u00b0F).  The stock should be at a bare simmer, just a bubble or two coming up here and there.  (You may need to put the pot on your smallest burner on the lowest temp, or if you are using an oven-safe pot, place it in the oven at 190\u00b0F.) Cover the pot loosely and let simmer low and slow for 3-6 hours.  Do not stir the stock while cooking.  Stirring will mix the fats in with the stock, clouding up the stock.4 As the stock cooks, fat will be released from the bone marrow and stew meat and rise to the top.  From time to time check in on the stock and use a large metal spoon to scoop away the fat and any scum that rises to the surface.  (Do not put this fat down your kitchen drain by the way.  It will solidify and block your pipes.  Put it in a bowl or jar to save for cooking or to discard.)5 At the end of cooking time (when you want to end the cooking is up to you, 3 hours minimum, 6 to 8 hours if you can do it) use tongs or a slotted spoon to gently remove the bones and vegetables from the pot (discard them, though if you see a chunk of marrow, taste it, it's delicious).   Line another large pot (8-quart) with a fine mesh sieve, covered with a couple layers of cheesecloth if you have it.  Pour the stock through the sieve to strain it of remaining solids.  Let cool to room temperature then chill in the refrigerator.One the stock has chilled, any fat remaining will have risen to the top and solidified. The fat forms a protective layer against bacteria while the stock is in the refrigerator.

"aggregateLikes": 220, "instructions": "Peel the potatoes.  Cut each potato in half lengthwise.  Then cut each half section in half again lengthwise.  The cut each section into about 4 strips.  Put the strips of potatoes into a bowl of cold water for at least 5 minutes to rinse off the starch.  If you want to cut the potatoes ahead of time, they can be kept in water for up to a day.  While the potatoes are soaking in the water you can make the sauces.For the Hot Pepper Sauce:  Put the ketchup in a small bowl.  Dice \u00bd of a jalapeno.  If you like things spicy hot you may want to leave in the seeds.  Add the diced jalapeno and pepper in with the ketchup.  Mix together and set aside.For the Chipotle Sauce:  Put the mayonnaise in a small bowl and add the adobo sauce.  Mix and set aside.For the Baked Potato Topping Sauce:  Add the sour cream to a small bowl.  Dice the chive section from the green onion and add it to the sour cream along with the pepper, salt, crumbled blue cheese, buttermilk (or regular milk) and the diced garlic (optional).  Mix and set aside.Cooking the French Fries:  Drain the potatoes and put them on a paper towel.  Pat them completely dry with a paper towel.  Add the oil to a frying pan.  The quantity of oil to use depends on the diameter of your pan.  The oil should sit in the pan about an inch high.  Heat the oil on medium heat.  Add the strips of potatoes making sure not to crowd them in the pan.Using tongs move the potatoes around a bit as they are cooking so they cook evenly on all sides.  In this recipe I just fry the potatoes once until they are a light golden color.   This may take about 5 minutes.  (Another option is to fry them twice; the first time, cook them about 4 minutes until they are cooked through but are a light color.  Then remove them from the oil on to a paper towel.  Then, right before serving, put them back into the hot oil and cook them a second time for about 4 minutes until they are crispy and a light golden color).As you\u2019re frying the potatoes, have a plate ready that has a paper towel on it.  As the French fries are done cooking, remove them from the hot oil and put them on the paper towel to absorb the excess oil.  As soon as the French fries are removed from the hot oil, sprinkle them with the seasoned salt and serve as soon as possible.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

"instructions": "In a medium saucepan, combine the milks and cream. Split the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds. Stir the seeds into the milk mixture. Over medium heat, bring the milk/cream mixture to a slow boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.In a large bowl, combine the eggs, yolks and sugar together. Using a mixer, beat the eggs until the mixture is thick, smooth and pale yellow in color, about 2 minutes on medium speed.Remove the vanilla bean pod from the milk mixture and pour out a cup of the hot milk/cream mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the hot milk to the egg mixture. Be sure not to scramble your eggs, so add the milk in a slow steady stream while mixing the eggs on low speed. Mix until combined. Then pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk/cream mixture and stir to combine. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium low heat until the mixture is thick enough to cover the back of a spoon. Transfer to a bowl, cover and chill completely.When chilled, turn on your ice cream maker. Pour the chilled custard into the bowl and churn according to your manufacturer\u2019s instruction. About 5 minutes before completion add in the caramel sauce and keep mixing. Add chopped TWIX bites in the final two minutes.Transfer ice cream to a freezer safe bowl and freeze for about 3 hours or overnight.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-ince pie dish and set aside. Combine the graham cracker crumbs and pecans (or peanuts) in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Drizzle the melted butter over the mixture and pulse until combined and mixtures looks like wet sand. Press into the bottom and sides of the prepared pie dish. Bake the crust until set, about 10-12 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely.Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. In a clean bowl, beat the caramel, cream cheese, milk and vanilla extract until smooth, about 2-3 minutes on medium speed. Reduce speed to low and add in the powdered sugar. Mix until combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped TWIX bites. Gently fold in half of the whipped cream until just incorporated and then fold in the rest.

Strain milk mixture through a sieve into another bowl, pressing hard on and then discarding basil, and return to saucepan. Whisk about 1/2 cup warm milk mixture into yolks, then whisk into remaining milk in saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until custard coats back of spoon and registers 170\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer.

   Place the sweet soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, shallot, 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, the white pepper, and 3 tablespoons of water in a heavy saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Let the glaze boil until thick and syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/3 cups, 4 to 6 minutes, stirring often. If the glaze becomes too thick, add 1 to 3 additional tablespoons of water.

I urge you to get a charcoal grill for smoking, but you can use wood on a gas grill; you just won\u2019t get as pronounced a wood flavor.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            When ready to cook, if you are using a charcoal grill, toss the wood chips or chunks, if using, on the coals. If you are using a gas grill, add the wood chips or chunks, if using, to the smoker box or place them in a smoker pouch under the grate. Brush and oil the grill grate. Place the racks of ribs bone side down in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. (If your grill has limited space, you can stand the racks of ribs upright in a rib rack.)  Cover the grill and cook the ribs until tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. When the ribs are done, they\u2019ll be handsomely browned and the meat will have shrunk back from the ends of the bones by about 1/4 inch. If you are using a charcoal grill, you will need to add fresh coals after 1 hour.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            During the last 10 minutes of grilling, brush the ribs on both sides with the sweet soy glaze.  When the ribs have grilled for about 5 minutes after being glazed, move them directly over the fire. Brush the ribs on both sides with glaze again and grill them until the glaze is sizzling, 1 to 3 minutes per side.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Transfer the ribs to a large platter or cutting board and cut the racks into individual ribs. Pour any remaining glaze over the ribs and serve at once.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/grilled-baby-backs-with-sweet-soy-glaze-207968", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Whole Food Life", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sweet-potato-patties-704022.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 60, "id": 704022, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sweet Potato Patties", "preparationMinutes": 45, "creditText": "My Whole Food Life", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons adobo sauce from the can", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "adobo sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/harissa.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6979, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned black beans", "metaInformation": ["black", "rinsed", "drained", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 15.0, "id": 16018, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "4 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely chopped, and about", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chipotle chile in adobo", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/canned-chipotle-chili.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11632, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon coconut oil (for frying)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut oil", "metaInformation": ["for frying", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4047, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "4 ears of corn, kernels cut off the cob", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ears of corn", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-on-the-cob.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11167, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1022020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cumin", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1002014, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 cups rolled oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "rolled oats", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoon sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 large sweet potatoes (about 1 pound each)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11507, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 86.0, "sourceUrl": "http://mywholefoodlife.com/2016/01/05/sweet-potato-patties/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 215, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400F.Wash the sweet potatoes and poke with a knife to help to vent the stream when cooking.Bake for 45 to 50 minutes.

Start heating 2 to 3 quarts of water for the pasta. Add 1 teaspoon of salt for each quart of water.2 Cook the mushrooms in 3 Tbsp of the butter over medium heat, stirring, until all of the liquid the mushrooms give off has evaporated, 5-10 minutes. Set aside.3 In a large, heavy saucepan, melt 1/4 cup of butter. Stir in the flour, and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.4 About now, put the pasta into the boiling water you've heated. Follow the package directions and cook until al dente. While the pasta is cooking continue on with the recipe.5 Into the saucepan with the butter and flour, slowly whisk in the milk, cream, broth, and the sherry. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 to 8 minutes.6 When the pasta is ready, drain it. In a large bowl combine the pasta, the sauce, the mushrooms, the turkey, and the peas. Stir in 1/3 cup of the Parmesan and the 1/3 cup of Swiss cheese. Stir in the lemon juice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Note that if you have been using unsalted butter, and/or unsalted or low sodium stock, you will need to add more salt than you might expect. Just keep sprinkling it in until it is seasoned to your taste. Add a pinch of ground nutmeg if using, again to taste.
