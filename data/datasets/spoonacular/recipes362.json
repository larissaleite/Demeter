Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (in this case I did a rectangular baking sheet) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel that's covered with a little bit of cornmeal. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.pizzaHeat a large skillet over medium heat and add bacon. Cook until the fat is just rendered and the bacon is slightly crisp, but not fully cooked. Remove pieces with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain. Remove the bacon grease from the skillet (I keep mine in a mason jar in the fridge....) and heat it over medium heat again. Add the sausage (without the casing) and cook until it's cooked through, breaking it apart in to tiny pieces with a wooden spoon. Once fully cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Brush the dough, especially the outside crust, with olive oil and spread the sauce all over the pizza. Add half of the fontina and provolone cheese. Place the pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto slices and bacon all over the pizza. Cover with the remaining cheese and parmigiano-reggiano. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pizza crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Remove and cover with the extra grated parmesan, cilantro and chives.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet medium-high heat until just starting to smoke. Add pork chops to pan. Sear until lightly browned on both sides, flipping halfway through, about 8 minutes total.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Transfer pork chops to the oven (do not clean out the skillet), placing them on top of potatoes. Scatter remaining four cloves garlic around chops. Roast until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of thickest section of chop registers 135\u00b0F, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and tent loosely with foil.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            While pork is resting, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat, using the same skillet used to brown the meat. Scrape up any caramelized bits from the bottom of the pan. Add peppers and cook, stirring frequently until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar, sugar, and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Continue cooking until peppers are just beginning to soften, another 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the cut up butter and let it melt. Whisk frequently as it melts and starts to foam up. Once bubbling or foaming, whisk fairly constantly as the butter turns a rich hazel color. Once it gets to this point, remove from the heat and immediatley place on a cool surface. Whisk briefly for another 30 seconds or so, and then set aside to cool for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375\u00b0 F. Grease a 9\" x 5\" loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray.In a medium to large bowl whisk together the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate, large bowl, whisk together the cooled brown butter with the brown sugar until well-combined and lighter in color. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract and yogurt until smooth. Whisk in the mashed banana. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet until just combined, with the dry no longer visible; DO NOT OVERMIX! Place the peanut butter and nutella in two separate, microwave-safe bowls and microwave for 5-10 seconds each, until they've reached a somewhat pourable consistency but aren't too thin. Pour half of the batter into the prepared loaf pan, making sure that it covers the entire bottom, and smoothing it in an even layer. Drizzle half each of the warm peanut butter and nutella evenly over the first layer of batter. Add the remaining batter, spreading it out to cover the first two layers and smoothing out the top. Then, drizzle over the remaining peanut butter and nutella evenly over the entire top surface of the bread batter. Use a firm wooden skewer or a knife to swirl the batter around briefly. Bake the loaf in the preheated oven for about 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf (or a crack in the top) comes out clean. Cool in the loaf pan for about 15 minutes, and then carefully transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling - before slicing! Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and (preferably) store in an airtight ziploc-type bag. Slices of bread can be warmed up in the microwave for about 25 seconds.
