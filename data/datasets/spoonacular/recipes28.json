Cuta 6cm diameter circle out of the centre ofeach sponge (a 6cm biscuit cutter is ideal,or make yourself a paper template) and setaside. Then cut a 12cm diameter circlefrom the centre of each sponge by tracing aknife around a plate of the same diameter(or use another paper template). So fromeach sponge you should end up with a 6cmcircle, a 12cm ring and an 18cm ring. Swap the middle rings of the almondsponges with the middle rings from therose sponges, and fit the cut pieces backtogether. Handle the sponges very gently,to avoid cracking or crumbling up theedges too much. You should end upwith 4 sponges that look like targets.Heat the apricot jam to melt, then sieveand stir in the rose water. Brush someover the top of one of the sponges andtop with an alternating sponge. Repeatto stack up all the layers. Sit the cake ona serving plate or cake stand.Dust your work surface with a littleicing sugar and roll out your marzipanuntil big enough to cover the cake (usea piece of string to measure the cake; seetip below). Brush some more jam all over thetop and sides of the cake. Use your rollingpin to lift up the marzipan onto the cake,then ease it down the sides, pressing tostick. Trim the marzipan from the base,then decorate the cake as you like. Cutinto wedges and serve with tea.

Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until foaming subsides and butter starts to smell nutty and milk solids are a deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.                                                                                    2                                                                                                                                                                                                   To check the color of the butter, use a ladle or spoon to transfer some butter to a heatproof white bowl or plate. When ready, pour the butter into a heatproof bowl, scraping the milk solids off the bottom of the pan.                                                                                      3                                              Allow the butter to cool to room temperature, stirring it every now and then with a rubber spatula, then place it in the refrigerator until cold about 30 minutes. It is crucial that the butter is chilled until solid. Once cold, re-soften the butter at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes.                                                                                     4                                              When ready to make the cake, adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly butter an 8- by 4 1/2-inch (2-quart) loaf pan and dust is with a tablespoon of flour.                                                                                     5                                              Beat the brown butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment at medium speed until creamy and lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and continue to beat until the mixture looks fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula every now and then. Once the mixture is fluffy, add eggs one at a time, mixing well (about 2 minutes) after each addition. Again, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl every now and then.                                                                                    6                                              Once all the eggs have been added to the stand mixer, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a bowl and stir to combine. Combine the milk and vanilla in a separate bowl. Add half the flour mixture to the mixer and fold with a rubber spatula until somewhat incorporated. Mix on medium speed until the batter looks smooth. Add the milk mixture and beat on medium speed until smooth. Add the remaining flour mixture and mix well, 1 to 2 minutes, until the mixture looks smooth. Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula every now and then as you mix.                                                                                     7                                              Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Rap the pan sharply on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake the cake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of baking, cover the top of the cake loosely with aluminum foil to prevent the cake from browning too much. Continue baking until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool for 15 minutes in the pan before turning cake out on a wire rack. Allow cake to cool to room temperature before frosting.                                                                                    8                                              For the Frosting: brown the butter, following the process explained in steps 1 and 2. Add the powdered sugar and whisk until incorporated. Add the water one teaspoon at a time (mixing well after each addition). Add vanilla and whisk until the mixture looks smooth.                                                                                    9                                              Using the back of a spoon, slather the frosting on top of the cake. Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting has firmed up, about 20 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.

Set aside.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare two standard 12-cup muffin pans. Lightly grease each cup with shortening or nonstick cooking spray.In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; stir to mix. Set aside.Place the Kataifi in a large mixing bowl. Tightly wrap the leftover Kataifi and refrigerate or refreeze for future use.Pull the Kataifi apart to separate any clumps. Dont worry about the Kataifi breaking or tangling, this will make the nests look more realistic. Drizzle the melted butter over the Kataifi and gently toss with your hands to evenly coat. Sprinkle the sugar-cinnamon mixture over the Kataifi, and gently toss again with your hands until evenly coated.Divide the Kataifi mixture evenly among the 24 muffin cups. Gently shape the Kataifi to form a nest in each cup, completely lining the bottom and sides of each cup.Bake: Bake the nests until the Kataifi is golden brown, about 10 minutes; the nests will shrink a bit. Remove from oven and place on a wire cooling rack to cool.Reduce oven to 325 degrees F.In a large bowl, add the cream cheese and sugar; mix on medium low speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice and vanilla; continue beating on medium low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Add the eggs; beat until thoroughly combined, 1 to 2 minutes.Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of the sugared walnuts in the bottom of each Kataifi nest to cover the bottom of the nest. Reserve the remainder of the sugared walnuts to sprinkle on top before serving.Spoon a heaping tablespoon (or more if the nest will hold more) of the cheesecake filling into each nest. Tip: Pour any leftover cheesecake filling into a ramekin to bake and enjoy as a separate treat.Bake: Bake the nests 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is set and slightly puffy. Remove from oven, and place on a wire cooling rack to cool slightly. Use a small offset spatula to gently lift the nests out of the pan and place on a wire cooling rack to cool completely.Just before serving, sprinkle some of the remaining sugared walnuts on top of each nest, along with 3 or 4 of the candies.The Kataifi nests are best served freshly baked, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/kataifi-cheesecake-nests-672291", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 155, "servings": 7, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Leites Culinaria", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Deep-Dish-Sour-CreamApple-Pie-with-Cardamom-Streusel-597733.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 300, "id": 597733, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Deep-Dish Sour Cream\u2013Apple Pie with Cardamom Streusel", "preparationMinutes": 60, "creditText": "Leites Culinaria", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 cups sifted cake flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "cake flour", "metaInformation": ["sifted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 10020129, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg yolk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolk", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large", "at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 6.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cardamom", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cardamom.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2006, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": ["finely grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 cups sour cream (not low-fat)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "low fat sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour", "low-fat", "(not )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1179, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "5 tablespoons sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 20.0, "sourceUrl": "http://leitesculinaria.com/25584/recipes-sour-cream-apple-pie-streusel.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "aggregateLikes": 66, "instructions": "Make the apple pie crust1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter with the flat paddle attachment on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar gradually and continue to beat on medium-high speed until lightened and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolk until well combined. Add the flour and pulse the mixer on and off until it begins to combine, and then run the mixer on medium-low speed just until the dough begins to form. Scrape out onto plastic wrap and use the wrap to help press the dough into a flat disk shape. Wrap the dough thoroughly. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.2. Roll out half of the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch round. Use the bottom of a 9-by-3-inch round springform pan as a guide and cut out a 9-inch circle. Assemble the pan with the sides locked into place, and coat the inside with nonstick spray. Transfer the circle of crust to the bottom of the pan. Roll out the remaining dough and cut 2 long strips, each one 17 x 2 inches. Take one strip and fit it into the pan along the side; have the bottom slightly curve in over the bottom crust. Press the lower edge of the strip against the bottom crust to seal. Brush the short, vertical edges of the side strip with water and press the second strip into place, trimming to fit with about 1/2 inch of overlap. Press the overlapping edges well to seal. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.Make the apple filling3. Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).4. Toss together the apple slices and sugar in a large saut\u00e9 pan. Cook over medium heat, occasionally stirring gently, taking care not to crush the fruit pieces. Cook for about 5 minutes, just until the mixture begins to exude juices and the apples soften just a tiny bit. Remove from the heat, cool slightly, then sprinkle the flour over, and toss gently to coat.5. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl, then whisk in the sour cream, zest, and vanilla. Fold into the fruit mixture.6. Remove the crust from the refrigerator and scrape the filling into the crust. It will come right up to the top of the crust. Bake for 15 minutes while you prepare the streusel.Make the cardamom streusel7. Combine all the ingredients until well blended.8. After the pie has baked for 15 minutes, remove from the oven and turn the heat down to 375\u00b0F. Squeeze the streusel between your fingers and palms to create clumps ranging in size from small to large grapes and scatter all over the top of the pie. There is a lot of streusel; use it all, gently mounding it in the center.9. Return the apple pie to the oven and bake for 15 minutes more. Turn the heat down to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes more, or until the streusel is evenly browned and the pie feels firm when gently pressed. If you can see any filling bubbling around the edges, that is a good sign of doneness, but most likely it will be completely covered with streusel.10. Cool the pan on a rack to allow the filling to thicken and set. Serve the apple pie at room temperature.

Cook for about 90 seconds on that side.4) Flip crepe carefully with a thin spatula and cook for another 15 seconds on the second side until it's lightly browned.5) Cook all the crepes and stack them up.To make a crepe box:1) Place a crepe on a baking sheet (it's fairly hard to transfer after shaping it).2) Sprinkle some grated cheese in the center of a crepe and hollow out the center a bit. Lay some ham on the crepe but leave some room in the center for the egg.3) Crack an egg in the center and then carefully roll the edges of the crepe up to form sides of a box. You will have to kind of press the crepe edges down to keep them in place.4) You should be able to fit 2-3 boxes on a baking sheet. Bake the crepe box until the egg is just firm, but still a bit runny in the yolk, about 15-18 minutes. When it comes out, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and serve immediately.For the sweet version, slice apples thinly. Smear the crepe with a few tablespoons of cream cheese and top with sliced apples. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar and roll crepe edges up to form a box.

Transfer the dough to the baking sheet.Brush the pizza dough all over with a 1/2 tablespoon olive oil then bake it until it's golden brown and the crust is crisp around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes.While the dough is baking, mince 1 clove of garlic and add it to a medium bowl along with the diced tomatoes, chopped basil, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Set the mixture aside.Boil the balsamic vinegar and sugar in small saucepan until it has reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Set the syrup aside to cool. (See Kelly's Notes.) Remove the pizza dough from the oven. Slice the tip off of the remaining garlic clove and immediately rub the cutoff end all over the hot pizza dough.Slice the pizza into 6 to 8 slices then spoon the tomato mixture on top. Drizzle the tomato mixture with balsamic syrup, garnish with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.Kelly's Notes:The balsamic syrup will thicken as it cools. Once it has cooled completely, it can be poured into a bottle and kept in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.If you cook the balsamic vinegar too long, it'll turn into caramel and then eventually taffy.

Add the bread flour and stir to make a wet dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours and up to 15 hours. The next day the starter should be soupy with a bubbly surface.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the garlic in foil and bake for about 30 minutes until fragrant. Let cool, then slip garlic cloves out of their skins and roughly chop.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add all of the starter and use a dough whisk or spatula to break it up into the water. It doesn't have to completely dissolve into the water. Add the bread flour, salt, sugar, and chopped garlic. Knead the dough with the mixer on medium speed for about 12-15 minutes. At first the dough will be very wet, but eventually it will thicken somewhat and clear the sides of the bowl, and turn glossy and smooth. When you turn off the mixer, it will pool at the bottom of the bowl, and that's okay.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until tripled, about 1 1/2 hours.With generously floured hands, scoop the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface. Divide the dough in two. Working very gently, and re-flouring your hands as necessary, shape dough into oblong loaves and place each on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Let rise, uncovered, until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Bake until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped, 20-25 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve warm or at room temperature.

and a kitchen torchFor the squash: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.Toss the butternut squash with the sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl. Spread out the squash on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with more foil and secure the edges. Roast until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil from the top and continue to roast until slightly golden, about 10 more minutes. Let cool and then puree in a food processor and set aside.For the pecan jaconde: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the granulated sugar and salt and whip until stiff peaks form. Add the egg yolks slowly and continue whipping until combined, about 2 minutes.Sift in the flour in 3 stages, folding carefully to prevent deflating and making sure there are no lumps. Fold in the melted butter.Spread on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the pecans. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool and cut into two 8-inch circles. Tip: leftovers can be use in a trifleFor the pecan rum cake syrup: Bring the granulated sugar, pecans and 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Boil for three minute or so to release the pecan oils. Remove from the heat and add the rum. Use warm to moisten the sponge while assembling the cakeFor the butternut squash pudding: In a pot, bring the sugar, cream, condensed milk, cinnamon sticks, pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup of the milk to a boil.. In a medium bowl, mix the cornstarch with the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk.Remove the cinnamon sticks carefully from the milk mixture and temper the cornstarch mixture with it, whisking the hot mixture by the ladleful into the cornstarch mixture. Return the tempered mixture to the pot and add 2 cups of the squash puree (reserve the remaining puree for another use). Cook on medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the pudding thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and butter and mix until incorporated.For the marshmallow meringue: In a small pot, bring the granulated sugar and 6 tablespoons water to a boil. Cook to 240 degrees F or the soft ball stage. Once the syrup has reached 210 degrees F, start whipping the egg whites. As soon as the syrup reaches 240 degrees F, add the syrup to the egg whites while whipping. Add the melted marshmallow and pumpkin pie spice and whip until cooled, 5 to 10 minutes.To assemble the cake: Use an 8-inch ring mold. Place a layer of pecan joconde sponge on the bottom and drench with half the syrup. Cover with a layer of the warm pudding as thick as the cake. Repeat with another layer of cake and pudding. Allow to cool in the refrigerator until the pudding sets, about 20 minutes. Once cooled, remove from the ring and decorate with the marshmallow meringue all around the cake. Torch the outside of the cake gently to create a brulee look. Decorate with cape gooseberries and chopped pecans, if using.                                                                    Propane Gas Torch Safety: Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \"finger tight\" when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

Add Greek yogurt, vanilla and lavender (and earl grey tea, if using), and beat for an additional minute, stopping partway to scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula.

Once the sugar dissolves,pull the bowl off the heat. Add the cake of yeast or instant yeast, stirring until it melts (milk temperature should be between 72-85\u00b0 F). Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Beat in 4 egg yolks, the remaining milk, 1 cup of the butter, and vanilla.Onto a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil, sift the flour, salt, and remaining sugar. Gradually stir it into the yeast mixture until it forms a soft and slightly sticky dough. Knead until the dough no longer clings to the fingers. Add more from the 1/4 cup of flour if the mixture is too sticky (remember that this is a dessert dough and should be lighter in texture than a bread dough).Cut dough into 4 equal parts and wrap loosely in wax paper. Let rise in the fridge overnight or on the counter for 3-4 hours, until it has doubled in size.Prepare the filling by mixing all filling ingredients in a large bowl (Note that the filling can be prepared the night before and stored refrigerated). Dust your work surface with powdered sugar and roll out dough into an rectangular disk, 1/2 inch thickness, about a yard in length.Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Spread on the filling with a spatula, leaving a 1/2 inch space around the edges. For a variation, I\u2019ve made my own marzipan and added candied oranges and golden raisins to the filling. Granny also uses off-the-shelf poppy seed filling (Baker brand), which is just as delicious as the nut filling.Once the filling is well distributed, gently pull up the edge closest to you and begin to roll the dough over the nut filling into a log. Be careful that the dough doesn\u2019t stick to your work surface \u2013 use your thumbs to push the dough slowly over onto itself. It\u2019s better to work with a somewhat sticky dough vs. adding more powdered sugar though, since this will make the dough tough.After you have rolled the dough into a tight cylinder, smooth the seam with your fingers and pull the ends up and tuck them over to seal. Granny always emphasized to press on the ends \u2013 this ensures that the filling won\u2019t burst out of the ends. After preparing all four rolls, set them seam-side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Baste the top of the rolls with the two tablespoons of extra butter.Pop your treasures into the oven. They might burst at the seams (mine often do), but that\u2019s the beauty of a truly home-made, rustic family recipe. Once they are browned lightly on top, remove them (after about 25-30 minutes). Once they have cooled completely (about 90 minutes), don\u2019t forget to wrap them tightly, so they don\u2019t dry out. I\u2019m convinced that they are moister if you allow them to sit a day or two. When you are ready to serve, cut the rolls into 2 inch thick slices with a serrated knife and place them on a decorative tray.

"aggregateLikes": 34, "instructions": "1. Slide an oven rack into an upper third position and another into the lower third slot in the oven. Crank the heat to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).2. Rinse the duck necks in cold water and pat them very, very dry. Don\u2019t skimp on the patting-them-dry part, or the necks will steam instead of roast, which means you can say goodbye to those delectable caramelized bits of duck skin and fat that ought to stick to the baking sheet and impart an unspeakable amount of flavor to the stock. (If your duck necks are frozen together, as mine were, chuck them in a colander and run cold tap water over them until you can break them apart.)3. Line two rimmed baking sheets or roasting pans with aluminum foil. Dump a few big handfuls of duck necks onto the pans, drizzle them with some of the oil, and toss to coat them well. Place the necks, side by side, in a single layer. Any extra necks will have to wait for the next batch.4. Roast the necks, turning them several times, until they turn a deep mahogany and the bottoms of the baking sheets are glazed with anatine goodness, 45 to 60 minutes. 5. Meanwhile, find a very, very, very large pot. Barring that, two large ones. Using tongs, transfer the necks to the pot(s) as they come out of the oven and forget about them while you roast the rest. I ended up with nine baking sheets\u2019 worth of necks; they took quite some tIme to roast, although it was mostly unattended.  If you like, when you\u2019re done roasting, slide the empty baking sheets on top of the stove and turn the burners beneath them to medium. Drizzle in a little water, scrape up the bits with a spoon, and pour the liquid gold into the pot. Every bit counts.6. Add enough cold water (not warm or hot but cold) to cover the necks by several inches. Bring the water to a gentle simmer\u2014the kind that sends up fairly steady columns of lazy bubbles\u2014and let time work its magic. Skim any scum that forms on the surface. Depending on the size of your pot, this will take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.7. Once the scum has pretty much been removed, add the onions, carrots, thyme, garlic, and tomato paste to the pot (or divide them between the two pots). Let the stock burble until the meat easily pulls away from the bones, 4 to 6 hours more. Keep an eye on the pot so the bones and vegetables remain submerged. If the stock level drops too much, pour hot water into the pot.8. Place a colander in a bowl or pot large enough to hold a vast quantity of stock and carefully pour the stock into the colander to catch the large bits and bobs of meat and bone. (Watch out, it\u2019s hot!) Toss out the contents of the colander, because if the stock was cooked properly, the liquid will have leached every last iota of flavor from the meat (although the remnants did make a great meal for our Devil Cat, Rory). Wash the pot well and set it aside.9. Line a fine sieve with several layers of paper towels and place it over the pot. Slowly pour the stock through the sieve. Let the stock filter through, without pressing on the paper towels. If you\u2019re a perfectionist or simply like a perfectly clear, shimmering stock, you can repeat this step once or twice.

Toast the pine nuts in a small pan until brown.Brown the sausage on both sides in a large pan.  Remove & set aside.  Add the olive oil to the pan along with the onions and garlic and a pinch of salt.  Stir to scrape up the browned pits and cook until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes and cook for another 5-6 minutes.Add 1 cup of the broth and stir.  Bring to a simmer.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  In a small bowl, whisk the remaining broth with the cornstarch.  Add the cooked couscous to the rest of the ingredients.  When the broth is simmering, add the broth/cornstarch mixture and stir well.  Simmer until the sauce thickens.  Adjust seasonings to taste and stir in the cheese.Cassie's Notes:A few variations to this meal that we have tried and loved:-add 1-2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar after the broth/cornstarch mixture is added-replace the broccoli with 1-inch pieces of fresh asparagus or with halved Brussels sprouts-add some sliced mushrooms-replace the sun-dried tomatoes with blistered grape tomatoes (blister the tomatoes by roasting, tossed in olive oil and salt & pepper, in a 425 degree oven for about 25 minutes)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/smoked-turkey-sausage-israeli-couscous-skillet-603519", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 35, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
