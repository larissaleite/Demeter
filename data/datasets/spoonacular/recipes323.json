Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (don\u2019t let the water actually touch the bowl) and stir occasionally until the mixture is completely melted and smooth.  Carefully transfer the melted chocolate mixture to a medium bowl and let cool slightly (you want it to be warm to the touch).  When warm, add in the sugar, vanilla, salt and reduced stout and mix until combined.  Add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition until just combined.  Add in the flour and gently fold into the mixture.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.Bake for about 45 to 55 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the surface of the brownies starts to crack.  Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool completely (don\u2019t try to remove them until they are completely cool!).  Once cool, lift out of the pan using the foil overhang.  Set on a cutting board.To make the frosting - add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until light and fluffy.  With the mixer on low, slowly add in the confectioners\u2019 sugar.  Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until well combined.  Add in the salt, vanilla and irish cream.  Beat on low speed until incorporated and then increase the speed to high and beat for about 3 minutes, until fluffy. Spread the frosting in an even layer over the cooled brownies.  Sprinkle lightly with some flaky sea salt.

In fact, I know plenty of food photographers who have access to a pimped-out photo studio and still prefer the simplicity and elegance of natural light coming in from a window and onto a table.Window Lighting Tip! One tip with natural light from windows - if you have curtains on them (even transluscent, silky cutains) make sure they are white in color. The last thing you want is to have beige or gold-colored curtains tinting your crisp clear, white natural light a yellow-ish color. I actually added some silky see-through white curtains to my windows to give the natural light I work with a muted tone - and a bright, crisp filter.Tempeh Pairing.
