Pulse once or twice to combine. Add the diced butter and pulse until you end up with small pieces of butter, similar to the size of rice. You may also do this in a bowl, using your hands to break the butter into pea size pieces.In a small bowl, whisk together the one egg yolk and 3 tablespoons ice cold water. Add it to the dough and pulse until the dough comes together. If needed add 1-2 tablespoons more ice water. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, knead a couple of times and then form the dough into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Toss the delicata squash (you can also roast the seeds for topping!) with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet with sides and roast for 25-30 minutes or until the flesh is soft and the edges golden.Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on a paper towel lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease and return the pan to the stove.Add the butter and once hot, add the mushrooms + a good pinch of salt + pepper. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the balsamic and thyme, continue cooking another 3-5 minutes or until the mushrooms are caramelized. Remove from the heat and stir the bacon into the mushroom. Set aside to cool.Now grab your dough from the fridge. Flour your work surface and roll the dough to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leaving a 3-inch border around the edges, spread the dough with the fig preserves, fontina cheese and then scatter on the mushroom/bacon mix and add a few slices of roasted squash, leaving a few out of the mix for topping later. Top with the figs. Fold the edge of the dough over the filling. Brush the crust with the beaten egg and then sprinkle the parmesan cheese on the edges of the dough. Place the galette in the fridge for 15 minutes or until ready to bake.Bake the galette at 375 degrees F. for 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden. Allow to cool 5 minutes and then slice and serve topped with the roasted squash (warm the squash back up in the oven for 5 minutes first).

Drain the mushrooms. Remove and discard the stems; finely chop the caps. Combine the chopped caps, ground chicken (or turkey), breadcrumbs, egg white, scallion whites, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, honey, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Gently mix and squeeze until well combined. Use a generous 2 tablespoons each to shape the mixture into 24 meatballs. Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.To prepare glaze: Combine mirin (or sherry), soy sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar and ginger in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the cornstarch-water mixture, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, 2 to 5 minutes.To prepare kebabs: Preheat half to two-thirds of a gas grill to medium-high (1 burner if you have a 2-burner grill; 2 burners on a 3-burner grill) or build a medium-high-heat fire on one side of a charcoal grill.Thread the meatballs onto flat metal skewers, 4 per skewer. Oil the grill rack (see Tips). Grill the kebabs over direct heat, turning once, until marked, 5 to 6 minutes per side. (If you try to turn the kebabs too early, the meatballs will stick to the grill. Let them cook for a minute or two longer before turning so the meat will release from the grill.) Move the kebabs to the unlit side. Brush the tops with the glaze and grill for 2 minutes. Turn the kebabs over, brush with more glaze and grill for about 2 minutes more. Remove to a clean large serving platter; tent with foil to keep warm.Grill scallions over direct heat, lightly brushing them with some of the glaze and turning frequently so the glaze doesnt burn, until tender-crisp and with a few char marks, 2 to 3 minutes total. Transfer to the platter.Drizzle the kebabs with any leftover glaze and sesame oil; sprinkle with sesame seeds.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

To make the sufganiyot, stir together the warm water, yeast, and the pinch of sugar in a large bowl. Allow the mixture to stand for a couple of minutes to allow the yeast to swell. Stir in the remaining sugar, the milk, vanilla, eggs, oil or shortening, salt, and as much of the flour as needed to create a soft dough. Knead the dough by hand or use the dough hook on a standing mixer, adding more flour as needed to form a firm dough that is smooth and elastic.2. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for about 1 hour. (If not using right away, you can refrigerate the dough at this point.)3. Gently deflate the dough. (If the dough is coming out of the fridge, allow it to warm up at room temperature for about 40 minutes before punching and proceeding.)4. Pinch off golf ball-size pieces of dough and form them into small balls. Cover the sufganiyot with a clean tea towel and let them sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.5. When you\u2019re ready to fry, heat about 4 inches of oil in a deep fryer or a heavy Dutch oven to about 385\u00b0F (196\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with a couple layers of paper towels.6. Gently press the sufganiyot to flatten them ever so slightly.  To test the temperature of the oil, it\u2019s a good idea to start out frying a single doughnut. When the doughnut appears golden brown on both sides, take it out and cut it open to see if the inside is cooked through. You want to attain and maintain an oil temperature that\u2019s hot enough so it bubbles but not so hot that the doughnut browns before the center is cooked. It may take a few tries to find the right temperature and timing. When you\u2019re satisfied that the oil is at a good temperature, carefully add the sufganiyot, 3 or 4 at a time, to the hot oil and fry until the undersides are deep brown. Turn over once and finish frying the other side. The total frying time will be somewhere between 1 1/2 and 3 minutes. Lift the sufganiyot out with a slotted spoon and drain them well on paper towels.7. If desired, place some granulated or confectioners\u2019 sugar in a paper bag, add a couple sufganiyot, and gently shake to coat. Use the tip of a spoon to make a small indentation in the top of each sufganiyot, much as you would with a thumbprint cookie, and spoon in a little jam or jelly.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/hanukkah-jelly-doughnuts-sufganiyot-597082", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Squash---barley-salad-with-balsamic-vinaigrette-210910.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 210910, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Squash & barley salad with balsamic vinaigrette", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "5 tbsp balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 2069, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "20g pack basil, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "basil", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 20.0, "id": 2044, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "15 black olives, pitted", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "black olives", "metaInformation": ["black", "pitted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-olives.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 15.0, "id": 1059195, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "300g Tenderstem broccoli, cut into medium-size pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "broccoli", "metaInformation": ["medium-size", "cut into  pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broccoli.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 300.0, "id": 11090, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 butternut squash, peeled and cut into long pieces", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "butternut squash", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "cut into long pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butternut-squash.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11485, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp small capers, rinsed", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "capers", "metaInformation": ["small", "rinsed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/capers.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2054, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp Dijon mustard", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "dijon mustard", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002046, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic clove", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 6.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "250g pearl barley", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "pearl barley", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barley-pearl.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 20005, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp pumpkin seeds", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "pumpkin seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 12014, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 small red onion, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "red", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10011282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "100g SunBlush tomatoes, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 11529, "unit": "g"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/7995/squash-and-barley-salad-with-balsamic-vinaigrette", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 963, "instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.

"instructions": "Cake -Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9-by-9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside. (Don't use a 9-inch round pan, it's too small.) To a large mixing bowl add the egg, sugar, sour cream, oil,peppermint extract (be careful, measure, and don't over-add; peppermint extract is very potent), and whisk until smooth and combined. Add coffee, cocoa powder,and whisk vigorously until batter is smooth and free from lumps. Alternatively use a handheld electric mixer to quickly break up cocoa lumps. Note about coffee -The coffee does not make the cake taste like a coffee-flavored cake. Rather, it brings out and enhances the flavor of the cocoa powder and adds depth of flavor; I highly recommend coffee but use water if you must. The coffee can be any temperature other than piping hot; you dont want to scramble the egg. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, optional salt, and whisk vigorously until batter has just combined, about 1 minute; don't overmix. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula if necessary, and bake for about 25 to 32 minutes, or until top has set and a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. I've found that climate and brands of ingredients used impact the baking time for this cake greatly, and have baked it in as short as 25 minutes and as long as 32; bake until it's done in your oven. Allow cake to cool completely in pan on top of a wire rack, at least 30 minutes, before adding ganache. Chocolate Ganache - To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add the chocolate chips and heat on high power for 1 minute to soften (they won't melt); set aside. In a small microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, heat the cream (I used half-and-half) on high power just until it begins to bubble and show signs of boiling, about 60 to 75 seconds. Pour cream over chocolate chips and let it stand about 1 minute. Whisk vigorously until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth and combined. Evenly pour ganache over cake, smoothing lightly with a spatula if necessary. Allow ganache to set up and cool for about 5 minutes while you chop the peppermint candies. If you add them while ganache is too warm, they'll melt. Too cool, and they won't adhere; use your judgment. Dice and evenly sprinkle the peppermint candies over cake. Allow cake to cool uncovered at room temp for at least 2 to 3 hours, or until ganache has set up, before slicing and serving. I am comfortable storing this cake airtight at room temp for a day or two, and afterthat I store airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week. Chilling it has a nice effect with the chocolate and peppermint.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water. Add the pinch of sugar, stir to dissolve, and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.2. In a large bowl, beat the 6 tablespoons sugar, the butter, salt, and vanilla or cardamom together with a wooden spoon or a heavy-duty electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and beat well. Add 1 cup of the flour and beat until smooth. Add the milk, then gradually add 2 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, beating well. Stir in the yeast mixture. Gradually add enough of the 1 1/2 to 2 cups remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out on a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a buttered bowl, turn to coat, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.Make the chocolate streudel3. In a medium bowl or a food processor, mix the sugar, flour, butter, cocoa, and cinnamon together. Cut the butter in with your fingers or process until crumbly.Assemble the coffee cake4. Punch down the dough and turn it out on a lightly floured board and knead lightly until smooth, 1 or 2 minutes. Cut the dough in half. Roll one half into a 10-by-14-inch rectangle. Spread evenly with half of the Chocolate Streusel. Roll up and place, seam side down, on a buttered baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, placing the loaf on a separate buttered baking sheet.5. With clean scissors, snip each loaf at 3/4-inch intervals, cutting three-fourths of the way through the dough. Starting at one end, pull and twist each cut slice on its side to lie flat on alternate sides. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.6. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Brush the loaves with the egg white and sprinkle with the nuts. Place in the oven, reduce the heat to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C), and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer the loaves to wire racks to cool completely. Cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices to serve.

While water comes to a boil, rinse tomatoes and remove stem; with a paring knife make a small X on the bottom of each tomato. Carefully add tomatoes to the hot water and boil for 5 minutes, remove from the heat, cover, and let sit for another 5 minutes.Fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. Add the tomatoes to the ice water and give them time to cool off, about 10 minutes. Add more ice if necessary. Peel cooled tomatoes; start from the bottom up. The curled edges help make the peeling easier.  With your hand, crush the tomatoes, into a non-stick pot. If they are still too hot, use a potato masher. Add the cinnamon and cloves and over low heat, boil roughly mashed tomatoes for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot.  Strain most of the water out of the tomato puree but leave enough in the tomatoes so they are not dry. I usually drain about 1 \u00bd to 2 cups of liquid. Reserve about \u00bd cup of the tomato liquid; refrigerate to cool. Remove the cinnamon and cloves from the tomatoes. Mash tomatoes again in the pot with a potato masher. Add sugar or piloncillo and cook uncovered for another 30 minutes. If needed add more sugar to taste. Add the cornstarch to \u00bd cup of reserved cold tomato liquid and whisk until well combined. Add cornstarch mixture to tomatoes and continue to cook for about 15 minutes. Cook until the consistency is like preserves.As the tomato preserves cool it will thicken. Can as needed or use immediately. Make empanada dough:Mix the first 3 dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening with the dry ingredients. Works better if you use your hands. Add the eggs, milk and sugar. Continue to work in with your hands. Split the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap and put into the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes. Take out one half of the dough and split it into 12 rounds of dough. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Assemble turnovers:Roll out one round of dough into a small round circle. Take a paring knife and cut off the edges creating a square. Add about one tablespoon of preserves on one half of the rolled out dough. Bring down the top corner and match it up with the bottom corner, creating a triangle. Seal off the edges of the dough by pressing down on the edges with a fork. This also makes for a pretty pattern when baked. Continue doing this until you have used up all your rounds and the scraps of dough. Remove the second half of the dough from the fridge and repeat.Assemble flower-shaped empanadas:Roll out one round of dough into a small round circle. Take a paring knife and cut off the edges creating a square. Add about one tablespoon of preserves directly in the middle of your square. Pull up the four corners of the dough and pinch together tightly at the center, making sure that all four corners won\u2019t come apart. With your fingers, squeeze the outer tips of the dough, creating a seal so the preserves don\u2019t escape during baking. Bake:Brush each empanada with egg whites, sprinkle with sugar.

Transfer to a blender along with the tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, and salt.

Add contents of blender. Stir well, and cook until the sauce has reduced into a thick sauce-like consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add the shredded chicken, and stir well.

Laissez reposer au frais 30 minutes.La p\u00e2te est alors pr\u00eate \u00e0 \u00eatre cuite \u00e0 blanc (piquez-la \u00e0 la fourchette pour l'emp\u00eacher de lever) ou garnie imm\u00e9diatement, selon ce que vous comptez mettre dedans. Dans tous les cas, il faudra compter 20 \u00e0 25 minutes \u00e0 200\u00b0C pour qu'elle cuise compl\u00e8tement.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the half-and-half and 6 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once up to a boil, stir in the grits. Bring it back up to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture has slightly thickened (it should resemble cooked oatmeal in thickness), 10 to 15 minutes. Use a whisk to break up any lumps that have formed.Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until just turning crispy, about 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel, patting it to remove any excess fat. Using the same saucepan, add the onions to the leftover bacon drippings and saute until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the collard greens and the remaining 2 cups chicken stock and cook until tender, another 10 minutes. Drain the collards and onions in a colander.Once the grits are done, add the Parmesan, butter, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup of the Monterey jack. Stir until the butter has melted and all the ingredients are well combined. Then add the drained collards mixture and stir.Transfer the grits mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with the crumbled bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup Monterey jack. Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

Line two 9-inch cake pans with parchment paper and generously spray with nonstick cooking spray. The parchment paper makes it easy to remove the cakes from the pan. Tip: I recommend turning the pans upside down and placing parchment paper on top. Use a pencil to trace the cake pan, then cut out the outline with a scissors and place parchment in each pan. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.In a large bowl, whisk together oat flour, almond meal, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer (or you can mix by hand), add in carrots, eggs, maple syrup, almond milk, vanilla extract, coconut oil and apple cider vinegar. Beat on medium low speed until ingredients are well combined and smooth. Add in half of the dry ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. Add in the other half of the dry ingredients and mix on low speed again until just combined. If desired, fold in any of the following with a wooden spoon: raisins, coconut, nuts or chopped pineapple.Divide batter evenly among the two prepared cake pans and smooth top with a rubber spatula. Bake for 23-27 minutes or until toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean with just a few crumbs attached. Cool cake in the pans for 30 minutes, then invert cakes on a wire rack, removing from the pans and allowing to cool completely. At this point you can remove and discard the parchment paper.Once cakes have cooled completely (about 2 hours), you can prepare the frosting.

Add a spoonful or two of flour. You're going for a smooth consistency but with a little hold. (this helps when dipping everything). I usually start with about a tablespoon and then add about a \u00bd tablespoon more. Honestly, I've found that a single tablespoon is not always enough.In another bowl, combine the rest of your flour, pepper and the old Bay Seasoning. You can add whatever seasonings you want, but this simple combination has won my heart.Add your olive oil in a big frying pan and turn it on to med-high. You want to make sure that the pickles are almost covered. You'll flip them so being completely covered isn't important, but being mostly covered on the sides, is. P.S. You can use any oil you want, but I found that not only is Olive oil the healthier alternative, it seems to be the only oil that doesn't leave an oily aftertaste.Allow the oil to heat about 5 minutes. While this is happening, move onto the next step.Now come's the fun part! Take a pickle slice and dip it into the egg mixture. Now dredge it through the flour mixture, covering all sides as well as you can. Now, repeat. Re-dip it into the egg mixture - yes even with the flour already on it, and then dredge it back through the flour mixture again.Now, get ready because you're going to be working with hot oil. Gently place the pickle into the hot oil (this is where those tongs come in super handy) and allow to fry on one side until lightly browned. I think it took maybe 2-3 minutes, possibly less depending on how hot your oil actually is. Flip them and allow the to continue to cook about a minute until golden brown all over.When they are ready to be removed, place the fried pickles on a paper towel to absorb the extra oil. Allow to cool slightly (they are really hot for about the first 5 minutes).Serve with Homemade Buttermilk Ranch dressing. (I kid you not this is the best recipe I've had for Ranch Dressing and pairs absolutely perfectly with these little fried bites of awesome!) It does need to be made the night before so all the ingredients and flavors can marry each other.
