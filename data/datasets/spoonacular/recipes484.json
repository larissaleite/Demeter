The foil is to prevent any water from seeping into the cheesecake through the pan seams.Reduce oven to 325 degrees F.In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt the white chocolate. Set aside to cool slightly. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Turn the heat off and place a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl on top of the hot water, the upper pan should not touch the water.In a large bowl, add the cream cheese and sugar; mix on medium low speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly and there are no lumps.Add the sour cream, vanilla, and flour; beat until mixed. Add the melted chocolate; continue beating on medium low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute.Add the eggs 2 at a time, beating until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute, scraping the bowl between additions. Tip: crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the cheese mixture. Tip: Do not overbeat the cheesecake batter. Blend the ingredients quickly to add as few air bubbles as possible. The ingredients must be well blended, but excessive beating creates too many air pockets which can cause the cheesecake to puff up too much during baking, and then crack during the cooling process.Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold the peppermint bark pieces into the batter.Let the filling rest about 5 minutes to allow air bubbles to rise to the surface.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil to use for the bain marie water bath.Pour the cheesecake filling into the cookie crust.Bake: Set the foil wrapped springform pan in a larger pan or roasting pan and transfer to the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan, and close the oven door. Bake 70 to 90 minutes. Tip: The Cheesecake is done when the edges are set but the center 2 to 3 inches are still a pool of liquid batter. The cake should look as though it has puffed a little and just barely beginning to brown. The center will still be soft and jiggly when the pan is lightly jarred or tapped with a spoon.Remove from oven, place springform pan on a wire cooling rack to cool. Immediately run a thin knife around the edge of the pan, gently pressing into the side of the pan to avoid gouging the cake. This allows the cake to contract away from the sides of the pan as it cools, helping to prevent cracks.When cheesecake is completely cooled, cover the pan and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours before serving. Try to avoid having the covering touch the top of the cheesecake as this may mar the surface.In top of a double boiler over hot water or low heat, combine  cup whipping cream and white chocolate; heat and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and let stand until mixture is cool and beginning to thicken, stirring occasionally to keep the mixture smooth. Stir in peppermint extract. Set aside.In a medium mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat remaining  cup whipping cream until soft mounds form; gradually add the confectioners sugar; continue beating until thick and stiff. Slowly drizzle in the cooled chocolate mixture, continuing to beat until well combined. Tip: the cream will whip easier if the mixing bowl and beaters are first chilled; place in the refrigerator to chill until ready to whip the cream.Spread the White Chocolate Mousse evenly over the top of the chilled cheesecake. Refrigerate the cake until the mousse is set, at least one hour.Sprinkle peppermint bark pieces evenly over the top of the White Chocolate Mousse.Serve with Whipped Cream Topping sprinkled with crushed peppermint candy, if desired. Refrigerate leftovers.In a medium mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat 1 cup whipping cream until soft mounds form; gradually add the confectioners sugar; continue beating until thick and stiff.Spoon whipped cream on top of cake or individual servings, or use a pastry bag and decorating tip to pipe the whipped cream into decorative rosettes. Sprinkle each piece with about  teaspoon crushed candy canes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/peppermint-bark-cheesecake-533645", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 1060, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Blueberry-Pie-with-Lemon-Crust-414743.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 414743, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Blueberry Pie with Lemon Crust", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 77.57, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 cups fresh blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "blueberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 9050, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon peel", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9156, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2/3 cup shortening", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "shortening", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "id": 4615, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 to 6 tablespoons cold water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": ["cold"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 12.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/blueberry-pie-with-lemon-crust", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and lemon peel.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "id": 9156, "name": "lemon peel"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "id": 20081, "name": "all purpose flour"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "id": 2047, "name": "salt"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Cut in shortening until crumbly.", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg", "id": 4615, "name": "shortening"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add lemon juice.
