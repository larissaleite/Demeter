Let the wash dry slightly, about 10 minutes, before baking.15. Place the croissants into the oven, immediately turn down the oven temperature to 400 \u00b0F, and leave the door shut for the first 10 minutes. Then working quickly, open the oven door, rotate the pan 180 degrees, and close the door. This rotation will help the pastries to bake evenly. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes longer, rotating the pan again during this time if the croissants do not appear to be baking evenly. The croissants should be done in 15 to 20 minutes total. They are ready when they are a deep golden brown on the top and bottom, crisp on the outside and light when they are picked up, indicating that the interior is cooked through.16. Remove the croissants from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool. As they cool, their moist interiors will set up. They are best if eaten while they are still slightly warm. If they have just cooled to room temperature, they are fine as well, or you can rewarm them in a 375\u00b0F oven for 6 to 8 minutes to recrisp them before serving. You can also store leftover croissants in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 day, and then afterward in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. If you have stored them, recrisp them in the oven before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/croissants-507357", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 4320, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Spicy Perspective", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Roasted-Red-Pepper-Dip-552344.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 552344, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Roasted Red Pepper Dip", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 52.65, "creditText": "A Spicy Perspective", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2031, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "12 oz. cream cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 clove garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "12 oz. roasted red peppers, drained and dried", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "roasted red peppers", "metaInformation": ["dried", "red", "drained"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 11916, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "3/4 tsp. salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp. hot smoked paprika", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "smoked paprika", "metaInformation": ["smoked", "hot"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1012028, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 22.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.aspicyperspective.com/2012/02/roasted-red-pepper-dip.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}], "step": "Add all the ingredients to a food processor.
