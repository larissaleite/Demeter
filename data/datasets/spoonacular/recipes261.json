Leave it to settle slightly, then pour the caramel over the base of 6 x 250ml ramekins and set aside.Beat the cream cheese and the remaining 85g/3oz sugar together in a large bowl, then beat in the eggs and the remaining orange liqueur. Strain in the infused cream, then beat everything together to make a custard. Skim off any froth and set aside.Boil the kettle. Place the ramekins in a deep roasting tin. Divide the custard between them \u2013 it will only come to halfway \u2013 then bring the tin to the oven and fill with hot water from the kettle so it comes halfway up the outside of the ramekin dishes. Bake the cheesecakes for 40 mins or until just set, then remove from the oven and the tin. Leave to cool, then chill at least overnight. These can be made up to 2 days ahead and left to chill.Up to 2 days before serving, make the bases. Crumble the biscuits into a food processor, then blitz to fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse until everything is mixed. Line a flat baking tray with greaseproof paper, tip the base mix onto it, then top with another sheet of greaseproof paper. Gently roll the mix out until large enough to cut 6 bases the same size as the ramekins out of it. Chill. To make the caramel squiggles, heat the sugar with a little water in a saucepan and boil to make caramel, then set aside to cool slightly. Line a tray with baking parchment and grease with a little oil. Drizzle the caramel up and down so that all the strands of caramel stick together to create stars, then leave to set. To serve, use a cutter the same diameter as the ramekin to cut out 6 bases from the biscuit mix. Lift the bases onto 6 plates. Unmould the cheesecakes, saving the caramel sauce in the ramekin. Top the bases with the cr\u00e8me caramels, drizzle the sauce over and around the plates, garnish with a star and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Add pork to bacon drippings in skillet; cook the pork 1-2 minutes per side until golden brown all over. Transfer the pork to a 6-quart slow cooker. Sprinkle ribs evenly with salt and pepper. Add ribs to skillet; cook 2-3 minutes on each side or until browned. Place ribs in slow cooker. Add drained beans, 1/2 teaspoon salt, onion, chicken broth, garlic and ham hock to slow cooker, stirring to combine. Cover and cook on low 8 hours or until beans and meat are tender.Shred meat with 2 forks (you can do this by removing the pork and ribs from the slow cooker or just digging in and shredding amid the broth and beans). Remove and discard ham hock. Add the meat back into the slow cooker if you removed it for shredding. Stir in vinegar and crumbled bacon.
