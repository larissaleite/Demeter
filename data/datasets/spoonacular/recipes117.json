If desired, you can strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer, or just use it as is. If your juice is not as sweet as desired, you can boil together equal parts sugar and water to make a simple syrup, and add a tablespoon or two until the watermelon juice reaches your desired level of

with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool.Meanwhile, toast the pecans in a large skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool, then chop.For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the champagne vinegar, orange juice, honey, Dijon and shallot in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil; season with some salt and pepper.For the goat cheese croutons: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Slice the goat cheese into 8 equal rounds. Add to 3 shallow dishes, the flour, egg and panko. Coat each goat cheese round with flour, then egg and then panko, shaking off excess, and fry until golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper-towel lined rack or plate.To assemble the salad, toss the greens, pear, pecans and tomatoes in a large bowl. Drizzle with some vinaigrette and gently toss to fully combine.  Divide the salad among 4 salad plates, top each with 2 goat cheese croutons, and serve.

Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the rice is tender and most of the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and let rest. Fluff with a fork right before serving.Meannwhile, quarter the bok choy through the stem ends. Halve the mushroom caps (or quarter them if they are large) by stacking them and cutting them in batches.Heat 2 large nonstick skillets with 1 tablespoon oil in each over medium-high heat. Divide the bok choy between the two pans, placing it cut-side down. Cook, undisturbed, until charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. By this time, the leaves will be fairly wilted, and there will be enough room to transfer all of the bok choy into just one skillet to finish cooking. Place the bok choy so that the other cut side faces down. Cook until charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, scallion whites, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Continue to cook, stirring, until the bok choy and mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes (if the skillet looks dry add 1 more tablespoon of oil). Stir in the scallion greens, then remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soy sauce and vinegar.While the bok choy cooks, pat the fish dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Wipe out the other skillet and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Put the salmon into the hot skillet, flesh-side down, and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook the other side to the desired level of doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more.Divide the vegetables and rice between 4 plates and top each with a piece of salmon. Drizzle with a little extra soy sauce.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Add the onion, season with salt and cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes; set aside.Combine 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and the milk in a bowl; set aside until the milk is absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the sherry and mustard powder in a large bowl until dissolved, then beat in 1 egg. Add the soaked breadcrumbs, the browned onion, the pork, turkey, honey, allspice, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper to taste. Gently mix with your hands until combined.Dampen your hands; form the mixture into 36 small meatballs, about 1 tablespoon each. Put on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.Put the remaining 1 cup breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Whisk the remaining 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl. Dip each meatball in egg, letting the excess drip off, then roll in the breadcrumbs; return to the baking sheet.Heat about 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the meatballs, gently stirring with a slotted spoon, until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Let stand 10 minutes.Fold the lingonberry preserves into the sour cream and top with the dill. Skewer each meatball with a pickled cucumber slice and serve with the lingonberry cream.Photograph by Anna Williams                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network

          Special equipment: a 10-by-15-inch rimmed baking sheetPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the onion in half, and shred each half on the large holes of a box grater. Squeeze the shredded onion dry between 2 towels, and scatter around a 10-by-15-inch rimmed baking sheet.Put the ground beef, egg, breadcrumbs and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, and mix gently, just enough to incorporate evenly. Drop mounds of the mixture all around the baking sheet, and press them into an even layer without disturbing the onions too much (but expect some of the onions to move around and peek through the meat). Brush the top of the meat with the vegetable oil, then season it evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of fresh pepper. Score the meat into 24 squares, cutting completely through with a spatula.Bake until browned and no longer pink in the middle, 8 to 9 minutes. Put a small square of cheese on each patty, and return to the oven to melt, about 30 seconds. Let rest a few minutes, then recut along the scores to separate.Top each patty with a slice of tomato and pickle. Slide a spatula into the pan, and let guests serve themselves. Serve alongside a platter with the buns and lettuce. Don't forget the ketchup and mustard.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.

Rinse the chicken and pat dry. If using 2 large breasts, then place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and halve them horizontally so you end up with 4 pieces of even thickness (if using chicken cutlets, skip this step). If the chicken pieces are thicker than 1/2 inch, place a large sheet of plastic wrap on a cutting board and set 1 piece of chicken on top. Cover with another sheet of plastic wrap and then pound the chicken to a 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or a heavy-bottomed pot. Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.Add the chicken to the bowl with the mustard mixture and turn to coat. In a second medium bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, thyme, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.Dredge each piece of chicken through the bread crumbs, gently pressing the crumbs into each side. Place a metal cooling rack on top of a baking sheet, and mist the rack with spray. Spray each piece of chicken on both sides and set it on the rack. Bake the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.

"instructions": "Directions                                                        Cut the zucchini diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices so they are the size of the the width of the bread. Spread them out on a plate or cutting board and season both sides with salt and pepper.Preheat a griddle or grill pan to medium-high.Cut the bread into 6-inch segments and then cut each segment horizontally almost completely through so you can open it like a book. Open the sandwich halves and press them flat against the work surface with your hands until the bread doesn't spring back. Put cheese on the bottom half of each sandwich.Working in batches, melt 1 tablespoon butter on the griddle. Cook the zucchini until slightly browned and soft, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until pliable and nearly transparent, another 2 minutes. As zucchini is cooked, put it on top of the cheese, dividing equally among the sandwiches. Divide the olives among the sandwiches and close them, pressing to flatten.Working in batches, reduce the heat to medium-low and melt 1 tablespoon butter (for a small griddle) or 2 tablespoons butter (for a large griddle). Put the sandwiches on the griddle. Place a baking sheet on top of the sandwiches and weigh it down with something heavy, like canned goods or a cast-iron skillet. The idea is to make the sandwiches as flat as possible.  (Alternatively, use a panini press.)Cook until the bread is crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook, adding more butter if necessary, until the cheese is melted and the bread is crisp, 2 minutes more. Serve immediately.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.

thickens (this happens quickly if you're not on low heat so be careful!).It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.Using the serving dishes you're going to serve this custard in, pour the mixture evenly (I like using 2 ramekins).Leave about 1 inch at the top of the ramekin for the top layer.Put in the fridge to cool for at least 2 hours or until set well.In the meantime, work on the next two layers.TOP LAYER //Blend all ingredients in the \"top layer\" ingredients in a high speed blender or processor until thick and smooth. Use your taste buds and adjust the lemon or vanilla seasonings to make sure it's your desired sweetness.STRAWBERRY COMPOTE //Bring strawberries to a simmer, the frozen strawberries will give off water and this will allow the mixture to reduce.Add ground chia seeds and stir until everything is combined, simmer for 5 minutes or until thickened.At this point, you can blend to make completely smooth or leave it with some chunks (I prefer it this way).Lastly, add in lemon zest and vanilla extract.Allow to cool in the fridge for at least 1 hour or until thick and set.ASSEMBLY //Take the custard ramekin, layer 1-2 tablespoons of the cashew cream, then finish by pouring the strawberry compote on top.

Place 1  teaspoons of cold jam into the center of 24 circles.Preheat oven to 375 degrees.Dip your fingers in a little bowl of water and wet the outside edge of a filled circle. Pick up a plain circle and press it in your fingers to make it slightly larger than the circle it will cover. Lay it over the circle you just wet and press down all edges.

Sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the egg washed tops. Finally with a toothpick make a small vent hole in the top of each.Bake for 20 minutes. Towards the end of the bake time, just as they are finishing browning, the jam will ooze from the vent hole.

"instructions": "Preheat the broiler. Set the rack near the top of the oven so that the top of the frittata will be 5 to 6 inches from the heat source.Snap the tough ends off of the asparagus spears and cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces. Separate the tips from the other pieces.Heat olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick, ovenproof skillet set over medium heat (you can also use a cast-iron pan, but you may experience more problems with the frittata sticking to the pan). Add the onions to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the asparagus stalk pieces (not the tips) 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to the pan and cook until the asparagus pieces are tender-crisp, about 3 minutes (more time may be needed if you are using thick asparagus spears). Add the asparagus tips and cook for an additional 2 minutes.While the onions and asparagus are cooking, whisk together eggs, smoked paprika, and thyme in a large bowl. Slowly pour the egg mixture over the onions and asparagus. Stir slightly to evenly distribute the vegetables. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. As the eggs are cooking, run a rubber spatula around the outside of the frittata to release the eggs from the pan. When about half of the egg mixture is set and the bottom of the frittata is golden brown, sprinkle feta cheese over the top of the frittata. Place the frittata under the broiler and cook until the frittata is slightly puffed and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven.Using a rubber spatula, slide the frittata from the skillet onto a serving platter. Cut into 4 wedges and serve immediately. If you are not able to easily slide the frittata from your pan, cut it into wedges in the pan and gently lift out each wedge.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Add yolks; puree 15 seconds longer. Strain through sieve set over large metal bowl, pressing on solids with back of spatula to release as much puree as possible. Discard solids in sieve. Set metal bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk puree until thickened and thermometer registers 170\u00b0F., about 10 minutes. Remove from over water.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In 3 parts, alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the batter, beginning and ending with the dry. Mix until just combined. Fold in half of the coconut.Line a muffin pan with paper liners. Fill each liner 2/3 of the way with batter. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the tops are brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove to a baking rack and cool completely.Preheat oven to 300. Put the remaining coconut on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and toast for 10/15 minutes stirring every 5 minutes to prevent burning. Bake until coconut is golden brown.Meanwhile, combine cream cheese, butter, 1/4 c. mango puree and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat until fully incorporated.
