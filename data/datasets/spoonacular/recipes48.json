Cut the berries in half or quarter them if they are especially big.                                                                Combine the strawberries, water, and sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Turn down the heat to the low, cover, and simmer until the berries are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the berries rest, covered, for 5 minutes.                                                                Transfer the berry mixture to a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium nonreactive saucepan. Once all of the juice has drained, set the berries aside to use in another project. Bring the juice to a simmer over medium-low heat until it has reduced down to 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g), about 10 minutes, and set aside to cool.                                                                 To assemble the pink cake, place the cooled cake on a flat, stable work surface. Using a long, serrated knife, slice off the rounded top of the cake so that it is perfectly level. An even, flat top is key to the look of this dessert.                                                                Using the serrated knife, split the cake horizontally into 2 even layers. Split each half in half again so that you have a total of 4 layers. Place the bottom layer on an 8-inch cardboard cake round or directly on the serving platter and set on top of a cake turntable, if you have one. Generously brush the surface of the cake with simple syrup.                                                                Prepare the buttercream by warming and whipping it to achieve a mayonnaise-like consistency (see Working with Buttercream). Measure out 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream and, using an offset spatula, spread it evenly on the bottom cake layer, being careful not to let it blop over the sides. As you spread the buttercream, let a small wall (about 1/4 inch high) form around the outer edge, creating a well for the lemon curd.                                                                Evenly distribute 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g) of the lemon curd in the well. Set another cake layer on top and brush with simple syrup; spread with buttercream, creating a well, and fill with lemon curd just as you did with the first layer. Repeat with the third layer. Top with the final cake layer.                                                                If necessary, warm the buttercream once again. Measure out 1 cup (5.2 oz / 146 g) of buttercream and use the offset spatula to apply it as a crumb coat, a thin coating covering all surfaces of the cake; a crumb coat will seal the exterior of the cake to help prevent crumbs from marring the final frosting. (It's important to measure out buttercream specifically for the crumb coat so that the unused buttercream remains crumb free.) Refrigerate the cake for 10 to 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.                                                                Reserve about 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream for the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, apply a thick layer of the remaining buttercream to the sides of the chilled crumb-coated cake. At this point, it's not important that the cake look pretty\u2014it's most important that the buttercream be evenly distributed around the sides. With the cake sitting squarely in the middle of the turntable and with the offset spatula held vertically against the frosting, begin spinning the turntable. Keep the cake moving steadily in one direction and apply light pressure with the spatula; the buttercream will begin to even out. I like to imagine the spatula as the needle that stays steady while the record (or cake) spins round and round on the turntable. My goal is to make the sides perfect before adding any Thiebaud personality. Make sure to watch the vertical line of the cake; I find it helpful to look at the right side of the cake at eye level while spinning the turntable. You can add more buttercream to any spots that seem thin and whittle down any thick spots with the spatula.                                                                Once the sides are perfectly vertical and smooth, create as much or as little texture as you want in the buttercream. I constantly refer back to Display Cakes as I try to capture the casual, slightly imperfect look of Thiebaud's cakes onto my neatly frosted sides. It's not easy! While spinning the cake on the turntable, I often hold my offset spatula vertically and gently wobble it back and forth, or I take a quick swipe at the cake with the spatula blade as the turntable spins.                                                                When the sides are to your liking, you'll find a ring of buttercream standing up above the surface of the cake. Lightly \"grab\" the excess buttercream in one area with the offset spatula and pull it toward the center of the cake, spreading it toward the center. Repeat until you have a nice, clean edge all around.                                                                If necessary, warm the reserved buttercream, and then mound it up on top of the cake in the center. Using a small offset spatula, start from the center and begin smoothing out the buttercream, inching it closer and closer to the edge of the cake. I work fairly slowly when doing this in order to get a nice, voluminous lip of buttercream where the sides and the top of the cake meet, re-creating the ring that appears around the top edge of Thiebaud's pink cake.                                                                Place the raspberry in the center of the cake.                                                                The cake is best served immediately.                                                             Do Ahead: This cake has many different components that require preparation before the cake can be assembled. The cake needs to be baked and thoroughly chilled before assembly, so consider making it the day before. It will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or for up 2 months in the freezer. The lemon curd takes 3 to 4 hours to set, so consider preparing it while the cake is baking. It can be kept for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for 4 months in the freezer. The strawberry concentrate can be made ahead and stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the refrigerator or 4 months in the freezer, but should be at room temperature before using. The buttercream is easiest to use when it's freshly made, but it can also be made ahead and easily rewarmed before frosting the cake (see Working with Buttercream). It will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for up to 4 months in the freezer. The simple syrup can be made shortly before assembling the cake but, if made ahead of time, will keep for up to 3 weeks in the refrigerator. To store leftover cake, press plastic wrap against the cut sides and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before serving.Above and Beyond: In the painting Display Cakes, the pink cake is the smallest of the three. But since 6-inch cake pans aren't common in home kitchens, I've made this cake the same size as the other two. To make a more faithful replica of the painting, bake the cake batter in two 6 by 2-inch cake pans; see Variations in Rose's Downy Yellow Butter Cake for details. Split each baked cake into 2 even layers so that you have a total of 4 layers. Build the cake on a 6-inch cardboard cake round or directly on a serving platter, using slightly less simple syrup, buttercream, and lemon curd on each layer.

Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan. Pour cream over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then whisk until melted and smooth. Do ahead can be made 1 week ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm, uncovered, in microwave in 15-second intervals and whisk before using.                                                            For chocolate leaves:                  Stir chocolate in small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Using pastry brush, brush chocolate on underside (veined side) of 1 leaf to coat completely (do not allow chocolate to drip over edge of leaf). Place leaf, chocolate side up, on small foil-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining leaves. Chill, uncovered, until chocolate coating is cold and firm, at least 1 hour. Working with 1 leaf at a time, carefully peel green leaf away from chocolate. Return chocolate leaf to same sheet; discard green leaf. DO AHEAD:  Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.                                                             For cake:                 Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Line 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking sheet with parchment. Coat paper with nonstick spray and dust with cocoa.                                                                Sift 1/2 cup sugar, cake flour, 1/4 cup cocoa, baking powder, and salt into small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks in large bowl until thick. Beat in oil, 2 tablespoons water, and vanilla. Gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until blended. Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually addremaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of whites into yolk mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining whites in 2 additions. Spread batter evenly on prepared baking sheet.                                                                Bake cake until puffed and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack 10 minutes. Sift light layer of cocoa over large smooth kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Cut around pan sides. Turn cake out onto prepared towel, leaving 3-inch cloth border on 1 long side. Peel off parchment. Starting at long side with cloth border and using cloth as aid, roll up cake in towel (towel will be rolled up inside). Place cake, seam side down, on work surface; cool completely.                                                                Microwave ice cream in 10-second intervals until barely softened. Unroll cake on work surface but leave on cloth. Dollop ice cream over cake by spoonfuls. Gently spread ice cream into even layer, leaving 1-inch plain border on long side opposite cloth border. Sprinkle ice cream with crushed candy. Using cloth as aid and starting at cloth border, roll up cake, enclosing ice cream in cake. Place cake, seam side down, on long platter; cover with plastic wrap. Freeze cake at least 8 hours or overnight.                                                            For meringue:                 Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Beat in vanilla.                                                                Cut off 1/8 of cake at angle at 1 end. Press cutoff part onto center of 1 side of log, cut side in. Spread meringue all over top, sides, and ends of cake. Using fork, make long grooves in meringue down length of cake and in circles on ends to resemble tree bark. Freeze cake until meringue is cold and firm, at least 3 hours. Using torch, brown meringue in random spots. Return cake to freezer. DO AHEAD:  can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.                                                                Garnish cake with chocolate leaves, fresh mint sprigs, and small candy canes.

With the base of a mug or measuring cup, smash or press down on each potato until it's mostly flattened (see photo in post).Drizzle each potato with about 1 teaspoon of oil and sprinkle on a generous amount of salt and pepper.

Remove the shell of the prawn and clean the prawns with salt.2. Now add the chilli powder, white pepper powder, oregano, basil leaves, and required salt in a bowl and keep it ready.3. Mix the prawns to this and mix gently. Allow to rest for 30 min atleast. Now add the parmesan cheese to it and mix it.4. Add the rice flour to this and mix well. In another plate add the bread crumps and parmesan cheese and mix well and keep it ready.5. Add the corn flour, all purpose flour and water and make a paste and keep aside. Now dip the prawns in the APF-corn mixture.6. Place the dipped prawns in the bread crumps and roll it. Again dip the coated prawns in the APF corn paste and again roll in the bread crumps. This is done for more crispiness and also gives a good coating. ( if you don't want the double coating you can leave this step ). Do the same for all the prawns.7. Allow to rest for 5 min. Now in a kadai or wok, add oil and heat it. When it is medium hot, slowly fry the prawns in batches.8. When they turn into golden colour, remove from oil, filter the excess oil wih a kitchen tissue.9.

Let sit for 24 hours in the fridge if you make the batter in advance or a few minutes if cooking immediately.2) Heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat with a small knob of butter (or use nonstick spray) in it. Once the butter is well melted and hot, add about 1/2 Cup of batter to the pan and swirl it around so the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan. After about 15 seconds, it should be pretty dry. Then give it a flip using a spatula to help out.3) Cook for literally 15 seconds on the other side and then take that blintz off and set it on a plate. The blintz shouldnt be crispy at all. It should be nice and flexible. You can immediately add more batter to the pan and keep going!4) Mix cheeses, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. It definitely helps if you start with your cream cheese at room temperature.5) Grab a blintz and put about two tablespoons of filling on it. 6) Fold in the ends so they slightly overlap. Roll up the other two ends until you have a nice little package of deliciousness.7) To cook, you can do it on the stove or bake at 400 degrees with a bit of butter and sugar on top for 10 minutes. Spray baking dish so they dont stick! If using stovetop method, add a bit more butter to pan (1 Teaspoon is more than enough) and once it is melted, arrange blintzes in the pan. You can fit as many as possible, but just make sure they arent overlapping at all.Let them cook for a few minutes on one side and then flip them over. They should be slightly browned and crispy!8) Warm cranberry relish up in microwave.9) Serve the blintz with a bunch of the cranberry relish!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cranberry-cheese-blintzes-536875", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 5, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Life Made Simple", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Salted-Caramel-Cookie-Dough-Cups-611327.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 6, "id": 611327, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Salted Caramel Cookie Dough Cups", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Life Made Simple", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bc c. all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 20081, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd c. granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc c. heavy whipping cream, room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy whipping cream", "metaInformation": ["room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1053, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 c. milk chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "milk chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10019146, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp. salt (I prefer non-iodized sea salt)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["(I prefer non-iodized sea salt)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "5 tbsp. salted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "salted butter", "metaInformation": ["salted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1001001, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semi sweet chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10019903, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp. vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 7.0, "sourceUrl": "http://lifemadesimplebakes.com/2014/09/salted-caramel-cookie-dough-cups/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 958, "instructions": "Line two mini muffin/cupcake tins with 18 liners, set aside.In a small mixing bowl combine the melted butter, brown sugar, flour, and vanilla.

The mixture will bubble, continue stirring for 2 minutes or until the butter has completely melted, then add the cream. Boil for 1 minute then remove from the heat and add the salt.

Spray the foil with nonstick spray.Stir the butter and chocolate in a large heavy saucepan over very low heat until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and whisk in the sugar, and then the eggs, 1 at a time. Whisk in espresso powder, vanilla, and salt. Then sift the flour over the chocolate mixture and stir to blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan and bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking, and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached. This should take about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on rack.Once cooled, run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. The pan I used produces a brownie that is 1/2\" thick. Be sure your cookie cutter is taller than 1/2\". Press small flower-shaped cookie cutters (the cookie cutter I used measures 1-1/2'' in diameter, a piece from this set) firmly into the cooled brownie. Use a thin metal spatula to lift the cookie cutter filled with brownie from the foil. Gently press the brownie out of the cookie cutter. Repeat the cutting process until your brownie looks like a big piece of swiss cheese, and you have a whole bunch of little brownie flowers.Cook the raspberries in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently until the raspberries are broken down into a sauce. Set up a fine mesh strainer lined with 2 layers of cheese cloth. Pour the raspberry sauce over the cheese cloth to remove the seeds. I gather up the ends of the cheese cloth and gently press out all the raspberry juice. Pour the raspberry juice back in the pot. Simmer until the juice reduces to a 1/4 cup. It will be a very rich red and concentrated sauce. Set aside to cool completely. With a mixer, cream the butter with a paddle attachment on medium high speed about 2 minutes, until lightened in color and a bit fluffy. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar, the 1/4 cup of cooled raspberry sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add another 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If you want the frosting less stiff, add some milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. I did not add any milk to mine, and thought it was perfect for piping. Fit a pastry bag with a medium-large round tip (I used a Wilton #12) and pipe the frosting onto your cut-out brownie flower, in little dollops.

Cook until the beef is browned on all sides but not cooked through, about 7 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add the onions, bell peppers, tomato paste, hot sauce and garlic. Stir and cook until everything turns a dark reddish brown, about 10 minutes. Add the ground chuck and sprinkle over the remaining seasoning. Stir and cook until the beef is browned, and then add the reserved beef chunks back to the pot along with the stock, wine, cornmeal and squash. Raise the heat until it comes to a boil, and then lower to a simmer. Cover and cook until the beef is tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Uncover and let the chili cook until it is thick and the liquid is reduced, another 15 minutes.

soup:   Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over a medium-high flame. Then add the onions and cook them for about 1 minute, until they start to soften up.   Add the cumin and chili powder. Cook for 10 seconds or so, until the spices release their aroma. Then add the chicken legs and mix well to coat the chicken in the spices.   Add the chicken broth and 2 cups of water, and turn the heat up to high. When the soup comes to a boil, turn the heat down to a simmer and stir in the oregano and salt.   Cook the soup, uncovered, for about 30 to 45 minutes, until the chicken is falling off the bone. Using a slotted spoon, pull the chicken out of the pot. Cool it down on a plate in the fridge.   In the meantime, stir the hominy and green chiles into the pot; then remove the pot from the heat. When the chicken has cooled, pull the meat off the bones. You can throw away the skin if you want, but I like to keep it on the meat and throw it in the soup for a little more mouth-feel. Watch out for rubbery pieces of cartilage and small bones. When youve pulled out anything you wouldnt want to eat, add the chicken meat back to the pot and bring the soup back up to a simmer.   For the salsa:   In a mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes and onions.   Mix in the salt, the olive oil, the lime juice and the hot sauce. The result should be tangy, juicy and rich on the tongue.   For serving:   I like to serve the soup in a pot in the middle of the table, with a big ladle that can pick up the chicken, hominy and liquid all at once. Give each person a large wide-mouthed soup bowl (so they can fit in all the garnishes) and make sure everybody grabs some lime to squeeze over the top.   Arrange the salsa and the garnishes in little bowls around the pot. Heap the tortilla chips in a big bowl, put a bottle of your favorite hot sauce on the side, throw some beers on ice and let everybody go to town.

Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with 2 to 3 teaspoons of the spice mixture. Brush the outside of the turkey with the canola oil and place drumstick-end down on the sitter or stand. Rub the remaining spice mixture all over the turkey.Place the turkey (on the sitter or stand) on the cooler side of the grill.

Heat oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, and carrot; saut\u00e9 until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add rosemary and thyme. Return beans to pan. Add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer beans uncovered until almost tender, about 45 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Continue to simmer until beans are tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water to keep covered if necessary, about 45 minutes longer. Add raisins; season beans with pepper. Cool.

Sprinkle short ribs on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add short ribs in single layer and brown on all sides, about 12 minutes. Transfer ribs to plate. Add onion, carrot, celery, 2 thyme sprigs, and garlic to pot. Saut\u00e9 until vegetables brown, about 10 minutes. Return ribs to pot in single layer, meat side down. Add broth, vinegar, tarragon sprigs, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and bring to simmer (broth will not cover ribs). Bake uncovered until ribs are tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.                                                                            Using oven mitts, transfer short ribs to stove top.

Trim away the ends of the fruit, then slice each into quarters. Remove the seeds from the lemon. Using a sharp knife, slice away the citrus flesh from the peels (some tangerines peel quite easily\u2014lemons are a bit more challenging). Slice the lemon and tangerine peels into thin strips, about 1/8 inch wide (or 1/16 inch wide if you like a more delicate marmalade).                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

Increase the heat to medium and return to a boil. If there are big segments of citrus that haven\u2019t yet cooked down, use a wooden spoon to mash them slightly, creating a more even texture. Cook until the marmalade is reduced by half, begins to thicken, and turns an amber color, 35 to 40 minutes (see note, following, on how to gauge doneness). Stir occasionally to ensure it isn\u2019t sticking to the pan. Remove from the heat and pour into the prepared glass jars or heatproof airtight containers. Let the marmalade cool completely, uncovered. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Note: To test the marmalade for doneness, place a small dab on a plate that\u2019s been chilled in the freezer and freeze for 2 minutes. It is done if a thin film develops on the surface and the marmalade stiffens to appear more jammy than liquid-y. If it simply spreads out and thins, it\u2019s not done and needs further cooking.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/honeyed-tangerine-and-lemon-marmalade-from-whole-grain-mornings-204146", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Jul's Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Peach-pie-603558.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 603558, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peach pie", "preparationMinutes": 60, "creditText": "Jul's Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "160 g of cold butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["cold"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 160.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "Cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 10.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "4 tablespoons of flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "250 g of flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "100 ml of ice water", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "ice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crushed-ice.jpg", "unitLong": "milliliters", "unitShort": "ml", "amount": 100.0, "id": 10014412, "unit": "ml"}, {"originalString": "1 lemon", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-wedge.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9150, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1.6 kg of peaches", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peaches", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg", "unitLong": "kgs", "unitShort": "kg", "amount": 1.6, "id": 9236, "unit": "kg"}, {"originalString": "Salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 10.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons of vanilla essence", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla essence", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1012050, "unit": "teaspoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 40.0, "sourceUrl": "http://en.julskitchen.com/dessert/tarts-pies/a-summer-peach-pie", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 84, "instructions": "Add the flour with the salt to a large bowl, then add the butter.

Stir then microwave in 30 second increments until golden, stirring after each increment, set aside (alternately you can just toast coconut in oven on a baking sheet since it is already preheated from baking crust).Allow Breyers Chocolate Ice Cream to soften at room temperature slightly then spread into cooled crust while smoothing top to form an even layer. Spread 3 Tbsp Breyers Caramel Flavored Ice Cream Sauce evenly over top then sprinkle evenly with toasted pecans and remaining toasted coconut. Drizzle top evenly with 3 Tbsp Breyers Caramel Flavored Ice Cream Sauce then freeze until pie is firm enough to cut into clean slices, about 1 hour (you can also serve right away slices won't hold their shape as well though).Recipe from Breyers", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/german-chocolate-ice-cream-pie-615741", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes":

salt. While this step is entirely optional, I strongly recommend it as it will make your chicken extra tender and tasty. To make the sauce, combine all the ingredients in your food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and bring to the boil over medium high heat. Stir until the sauce turns darker and has thickened, about 3-4 minutes. Kill the heat, cover and set aside.Remove chicken from salted solution and pat dry. Cut the breasts into 1 to 1 inch chunks. Whisk the egg whites in a shallow dish until foamy. Combine arrowroot flour, coconut flour and baking soda in a separate shallow dish. Use a whisk to make sure the ingredients are well combined.  Toss half the chicken into the foamy egg whites until well-coated, and then dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, making sure all sides are coated. Transfer chicken to a plate and repeat with remaining chicken.Heat oil in a large wok until it registers about 340F. Fry the chicken in 2 or 3 batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes, turning pieces over halfway through cooking. Transfer cooked chicken to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.Re-warm the sauce over medium heat until bubbling. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with sliced green onions and chili peppers.*Strain coconut oil through a fine mesh sieve lined with a paper towel and save for cooking.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/general-tsos-chicken-paleo-style-551023", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}]}
