Set aside.Place all the remaining dry ingredients in a separate mixing bowl and whisk to combine.With the mixer running on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix on medium speed until completely blended.Scoop 2 teaspoons of dough on your baking sheet, leaving 2-inches between cookies to allow for them to expand while baking. Dampen your hands with a small amount of water and roll the scooped dough into a smooth ball. This will give your finished cookies a nice round shape.Bake cookies in preheated oven for 12-13 minutes, or until just slightly browned around the outside. Allow cookies to cool for a few minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.Only frost cookies when they are completely cooled.
