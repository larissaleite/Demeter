Fold in the whipped cream.After you take the mini cakes out of the oven, poke holes in them with a fork. Brush the coffee mixture generously over the cakes. You could even take the cakes out and soak them in the coffee, but make sure they don't get too mushy, you still want them to hold their shape.Spoon the cheesecake mixture into each cup over the cake, making sure to fill them all the way to the top. There should be more than enough cheesecake mixture to fill all 12 cups.Refrigerate cheesecakes for at least 3 hours before serving.Before serving dust the cakes with some cocoa powder and top with a raspberry if preferred. You should be able to easily remove them from the tray, by pushing up the bottom of the cup, if you're having difficulty getting the cakes out, take a knife and run it around the edge of the cakes.",
