The finished marshmallow will be more than doubled in volume. Use a spatula to quickly fold in the chocolate chips; too much stirring can cause the bits to melt and give the candy a muddy look. Pour the marshmallow into the prepared pan. Sift coating evenly over top. Let set for at least 6 hours in a cool, dry place.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Invert the slab onto a coating-dusted work surface. Cut it into pieces and dust the sticky edges with more coating. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Dip the bottom half of each mallow in the melted chocolate and place on the baking sheet. Refrigerate until chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/crme-de-menthe-marshmallows-205570", "dishTypes": ["antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 405, "servings": 24, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Add A Pinch", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/homemade-coffee-creamer-718414.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 718414, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Homemade Coffee Creamer", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 49.58, "creditText": "Add A Pinch", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19911, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 23.0, "sourceUrl": "http://addapinch.com/cooking/homemade-coffee-creamer-recipe/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Add milk, cream, maple syrup, and vanilla to a quart glass jar with a tight fitting lid.
