Grill over medium heat until cooked through and the juices run clear (6-9 minutes per side, may vary depending on size of chicken breasts). Remove from grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.While chicken is resting, preheat the broiler in your oven. Also, toast all 8 slices of bread and spread about 1 tablespoons of garlic basil mayo on 4 of the slices of bread. Place them (mayo side up) on a baking sheet. Slice the chicken breasts and layer evenly amongst the 4 prepared slices of bread. Top each one with a slice of swiss cheese and place under the broiler just long enogh to melt the cheese (should only take about a minute).Remove from oven and top each with one with 2 slices of bacon, and a few slices of avocado. On the other 4 slices of toasted bread: add additional garlic herb mayo, lettuce, tomato, and red onion and then place the 2 halves together. Slice on a diagonal (you can place a toothpick in each half to hold them together) and serve hot!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bacon-avocado-chicken-club-with-garlic-basil-mayo-498820", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 40, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Eating Well", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/mixed-berry-almond-gratin-697444.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 50, "id": 697444, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Mixed Berry-Almond Gratin", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 116.67, "creditText": "Eating Well", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1002050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 large egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar, or", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 cups mixed berries, such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mixed berries", "metaInformation": ["mixed", " such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/berries-mixed.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9054, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "Pinch of salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup firm silken low-fat tofu", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "silken tofu", "metaInformation": ["low-fat", "firm"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tofu.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 16161, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup slivered almonds, (1 1/4 ounces)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "slivered almonds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds-slivered.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.25, "id": 10012061, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 23.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/mixed_berry_almond_gratin.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pie-pan.png", "id": 405915, "name": "pie form"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 400F.
