Add in 1/4 cup lemon juice and vanilla extract and mix. Set aside.Vanilla Whipped Cream: *This step of making the whipped cream can also be done closer to serving time. Chill a clean metal or glass mixing bowl for 5 minutes with the beaters. Add 1 pint whipping cream to the metal bowl, mix with a hand mixer on med-high speed until bubbly, add in 2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar. Whip until stiff peaks are reached. Refrigerate until ready for use.Assemble: Add 1/4 cup graham cracker mixture to the bottom of each 6 pint size mason jars. You may want to tap the jar slightly to get the crumbs to settle evenly on the bottom. Mix 1/4 cup blueberries and 1/4 cup strawberries to a small bowl and shuffle so they are evenly mixed then add to the mason jar, repeat 5 more times for the other mason jars, shuffling if needed to evenly distribute the berries. At this point, you may want to use a canning funnel so the sides do not get messy. Add 1/2 cup cheesecake layer to each mason jar, gently shuffling the jar to evenly distribute the cheesecake layer (it will settle more on it's own). Repeat with a layer of 1/4 graham mixture for each jar. Repeat a 1/2 cup mixture of berries to each mason jar.Chill jars for 2.5-3 hours or overnight for cheesecake to firm up.Before serving, top with whipped cream, berries and a dusting of confectioner's sugar.
