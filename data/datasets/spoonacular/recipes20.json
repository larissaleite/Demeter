Discard seeds or roast them separately as you would with pumpkin seeds.Slice squash into 1-inch strips. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the squash and toss to coat. Place the squash strips on a baking sheet and roast until tender, about 30 minutes.While the squash is roasting, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy bottom saucepan over medium heat.Add onion and cook until softened and opaque, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and allspice, stir, and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute).Add rice and stir to combine. Continue stirring and cooking until the edges of the rice are translucent and the center is still opaque, about 2 minutes.Add wine and stir to combine. Cook until the rice absorbs the wine, stirring occasionally.Add warm broth, a ladle at a time, stirring after each addition and occasionally stirring while cooking. Wait to add each ladle of broth until the rice has almost soaked up the last addition.Test the rice after you have added about 3 cups of broth to see if it is done. It should be al dente, with just a bit of chew to it and not completely soft or mushy.Note the risotto will not taste fully seasoned at this point.

Stir in the sugar and add enough water to make a total of 8 cups. Chill. Serve in tall glasses over ice. Garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Butter and flour a 9 x 12 x 1\u00bd-inch baking pan.Melt the butter, 8 ounces of the chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate together in a medium bowl set over simmering water. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs, coffee, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature (see note below).In a medium bowl, sift together \u00bd cup of the flour, the baking powder, and salt and add to the chocolate mixture. Toss the remaining 6 ounces of chocolate chips and the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour in a medium bowl and add them to the chocolate mixture. Spread evenly in the prepared pan.Bake for 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Don't overbake!As soon as the brownies are out of the oven, place the jar of caramel sauce without the lid in a microwave and heat just until it's pourable. Stir until smooth. Drizzle the caramel evenly over the hot brownies and sprinkle with the sea salt. Cool completely and cut into 12 bars.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Lightly grease a 9x13 pan.In a medium sized microwave-safe bowl or in a saucepan, melt the butter on low heat, then add the sugar and stir to combine.Return the mixture to the heat or microwave briefly, just until it's hot but not bubbling. It will become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the butter and sugar a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.Transfer the mix to a mixing bowl.Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder, and vanilla.Add the eggs, beating till smooth; then add the flour and chips and nuts if using. Beat until well combined.Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.Bake the brownies for 28-30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs clinging to it.The brownies should feel set both around the edges and in the center.Remove from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges with a table knife, this will help prevent the brownies from sinking in the center as they cool.Cool for 15- 20 min then drizzle the caramel sauce over and sprinkle sea salt on top of the caramel sauceCool completely before cutting and serving.</p>",

the sauce.Heat a pan and add the crumbled sausage meat. Let the sausage meat render fat then brown the meat in its own fat. Scoop out the browned sausage meat.If you feel there is too much fat in the pan, pour off what you don\u2019t want to eat. Just remember that the fat is really very tasty.Set the heat to medium and add the pesto to the pan. Spread it out over the bottom to heat evenly, scraping whatever browned bits are stuck on the bottom of the pan.Drain the pasta and throw into the pan with the pesto. Add the browned sausage meat.

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.2. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a second, larger bowl with an electric mixer, beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the flour mixture until combined. Add the vanilla and combine. The dough should come together into a soft, not-too-sticky dough. If the dough isn\u2019t coming together, add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time as needed, until the dough forms a ball. It\u2019s possible you may not need to add any milk at all. If the dough is impossibly sticky, sprinkle with a bit of flour.3. Divide the dough into 2 or 3 portions. Roll out each portion between large pieces of wax or parchment paper to a thickness of no more than 1/4 inch. Transfer the dough and parchment to the refrigerator to chill for 10 to 15 minutes.4. Use a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut dough rounds. If you wish to make your cookies exact replicas of the original Samoa, cut a smaller hole in the center of each cookie using a knife, the end of the handle on a wooden spoon, or any other small round device that you can find in your kitchen. Transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheets.5. Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned and the cookies are set. Cool them for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.Make the topping6. Reduce the oven temperature to 300\u00b0F ( 150\u00b0C). Line another baking sheet with parchment.7. Spread the coconut evenly on the baking sheet and toast, stirring every 5 minutes, until the coconut is golden, about 20 minutes total. Cool the coconut on the sheet, stirring occasionally, until it cools to room temperature. Set aside.8. Combine the caramels, milk, and salt in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high power for 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to stir it a few times to ensure the caramels melt evenly. When the mixture is smooth, fold in the toasted coconut. Using a small metal offset spatula, spread the topping onto the cooled cookies, using 2 to 3 teaspoons per cookie. If the caramel becomes too firm to work with, reheat it in the microwave for a few seconds. Let the cookies set.9. Place 8 ounces of the chocolate, coarsely chopped or broken into pieces, in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high power in 45-second intervals, stirring to prevent scorching. Dip the base of each cookie into the chocolate, scraping it along the edges of the bowl to smooth it, and then place on parchment or wax paper to set. Transfer any remaining chocolate into a piping bag or a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped off. If necessary, melt additional chocolate. Drizzle chocolate stripes on top of the cookies. Let the cookies set or, to hasten the process, transfer them to the refrigerator.

An easy way to do this is to put the batter in a large baggie and cut off the tip from one corner.  Then pipe the batter into the molds.  If you only have one pan, just cook the doughnuts in two batches, but remember to clean out the wells thoroughly between batches, and re-spray them.  Bake for 15-18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Don't over bake.Let the doughnuts cool  only briefly and then ease them out of the pan and onto a rack.  While the doughnuts are still warm, coat them with the sugar.  I did this by putting the sugar in a paper bag and then, one at a time, putting in the doughnuts in and gently tossing them in the sugar.  Be careful and do this one at a time, you don't want to break the tender doughnuts.  It is important to do this while the doughnuts are still warm, so the sugar will stick.To make the sauce, heat the cream and cinnamon to a simmer, then pour over the chocolate chips.  Let them sit for 10 minutes, and then stir until the sauce is smooth and glossy.  Serve immediately with the doughnuts.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-doughnuts-w-chocolate-sauce-557727", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45,

Grease three 8-inch pans (or do as I did if you don\u2019t have three and just use one of them twice) and set aside.In a medium bowl sift together flour, sugar, cocoa, soda and salt, and set aside.In the large bowl of a standing mixer, whisk together, by hand, the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla until combined, and then whisk in the melted butter. With the bowl under the paddle attachment running at a low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and continue to beat until smooth, about 2 minute. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in boiling water with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very loose.Pour the batter evenly between the three 8-inch pans and bake for about 35 minutes, until a toothpick or fork inserted in the center comes out with just a few steaming crumbs attached.Allow to cool to room temperature. If combining with the Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse Frosting, wrap entirely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours (or overnight) until completely cold.In a medium sauce pan, heat chocolate and heavy cream on medium-high heat, whisking constantly until it reaches a boil. Turn down to a low boil and continue whisking for another minute. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Quickly stir in the hazelnut extract and Nutella. Let cool completely to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap so that it\u2019s directly touching the frosting, and put in the freezer and leave it in the freezer overnight. It should be very thick, but not unworkable.To Assemble the Cake:Just before spreading, gently whisk the frosting only until it\u2019s spreadable. (You can use a wooden spoon if the frosting is too thick initially for the whisk.) Place each of the three cake layers side-by-side and frost just the tops with even portions of the frosting, heaping it toward the middle of each layer. Place the first layer on the desired serving stand and then stack the second and the third directly on top to create a three-layer cake. Get creative with the topping- a pile of raspberries, a pile of mixed berries, cherries with the stems still on, shaved chocolate, powdered sugar, etc.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/hazelnut-chocolate-mousse-cake-477729", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/grilled-eggplant-and-ricotta-crostini-743980.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 743980, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Grilled Eggplant and Ricotta Crostini", "preparationMinutes": 25, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices on the bias", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "baguette", "metaInformation": ["cut into 1/2-inch slices on the bias"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/half-baguette.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18033, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 2069, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "Pinch crushed red pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "crushed red pepper", "metaInformation": ["red", "crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1032009, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 medium eggplant, cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "eggplant", "metaInformation": ["medium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/eggplant.jpg", "unitLong": "slice", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11209, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons freshly chopped oregano leaves", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "oregano leaves", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2027, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup grated Parmigiano", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmigiano reggiano", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup ricotta cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "ricotta cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1036, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 56.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/grilled-eggplant-and-ricotta-crostini-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 137, "instructions": "Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.

Turn on occasionally.Note: Before poaching your eggs, melt the butter for the hollandaise sauce and beat your eggs yolks in a small sauce pan. Keep the pan cool.  Have these readily available.Add about 1 tablespoon white vinegar to your water.  Ensure you have enough water to cover all eggs and still have a little space around them.  Almost bring to a boil 160-170\u00b0F.  If you accidentally bring it to a boil, immediately add a metal tablespoon to the water and stir. This will bring it down to about 160\u00b0F.Add each egg to an individual glass or cup.Once water is at correct temperature, add each egg by slightly placing the tip of the glass into the water, as not to drop the egg from above.Allow to slightly simmer for 3 - 5 minutes, depending upon how you like your eggs. Three minutes seem to be ideal.Remove with slotted spoon.While eggs are poaching, add the cream of tartar, white pepper, salt and vinegar to the egg yolks and whisk rapidly and thoroughly. Traditionally, hollandaise sauce is made with vinegar alone or with lemon juice, but I do not care for the taste of one high in vinegar and am allergic to lemons, thus the alternative choices.

Add onions, salt, and pepper. Saute onions for a good 20-30 minutes. Allow them to really break down and have the natural sugars come out. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until ready to use.For the Sliders:Preheat grill to medium-high heat (350\u00b0ish). Place ground beef, half and half, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, chili powder, and black pepper into a large bowl and mix until just combined (don't over work). I like to use my (washed) hands to get it all combined. Use a 1/4 cup measure of meat and form into a patty, making an indentation with your thumb in the center. Repeat with remaining ground beef; should make 12 sliders.Whisk together BBQ sauce and vinegar (to thin it out a touch). Place sliders onto the grill and close lid. Cook for 3 1/2 minutes. Flip, baste cooked side with BBQ, close lid and cook for another 3 minutes or so. Flip again, baste with BBQ sauce and add 2 quarters of cheddar to each patty. Close lid for another minute. Remove from grill. Serve on slider buns with a scoop on sauteed onions, and 2 of the bacon pieces. Add additional BBQ Sauce (or BBQ Ranch would be fabulous!).
