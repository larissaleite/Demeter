To make the pastry: combine the flour, ground pecans, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly and trim the excess around the rim. Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the filling: melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, remove from heat and let cool. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl until frothy and then blend in the sugar. Stir in the syrup, vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the melted butter mixture until well blended. Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour the egg mixture over them. Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you're good to go. Transfer the pie to rack and cool completely before cutting.

Carefully pour the hot sugar-water mixture over the batter in slow cooker. Do not stir. This mixture turns into the sauce while the bread bakes; do not stir.Cover and cook on high for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the edges have set and are light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center of bread comes out clean. Start checking at just over one hour to ensure you don't overbake. My bread was done in 95 minutes. All slow cookers vary so cook until bread is done. I have not tested the recipe using the low heat setting and can't speak to baking time or results.Remove the top portion of the slow cooker (the ceramic bowl the cake is cooking in) from the base (heating element) to allow bread to cool momentarily before serving. Bread is best warm and fresh but will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days at room temp, noting the sauce absorbs into the bread by the second day. Storage is much easier if you use a liner because you can lift the entire liner out, bread and all, and place in an airtight container.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/slow-cooker-banana-bread-cake-with-brown-sugar-sauce-714699", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/salmon-with-red-pepper-pesto-802797.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 802797, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Salmon with Red Pepper Pesto", "pricePerServing": 394.62, "creditText": "My Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 garlic clove", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic clove", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1082047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup chopped bottled roasted red bell peppers, rinsed and drained", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "roasted red bell peppers", "metaInformation": ["red", "rinsed", "drained", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 11916, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 (6-ounce) fresh or frozen sustainable salmon fillets (such as wild Alaskan)", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "salmon fillets", "metaInformation": ["wild", "fresh", "(such as Alaskan)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salmon.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 15076, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "tomato paste", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11887, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "7 whole blanched almonds", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "whole blanched almonds", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds-(sliced).jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 7.0, "id": 12062, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/salmon-red-pepper-pesto", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png", "id": 404771, "name": "food processor"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill-pan.jpg", "id": 404648, "name": "grill pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Heat grill pan over medium-high heat.

I did mine for about 2 \u2013 3 minutes. You can kind of see the texture here.Slowly add the powdered sugar. It\u2019ll look like this. Make sure there aren\u2019t clumps of powdered sugar like I have below!Then add the evaporated milk and then the rum. Mix slowly until well combined.Put it in a pot large enough for all the liquid, but leave at least an inch free from the top of the pot. If you have to do it in two batches, then do it in two batches. If you fill it almost to the top of the pot, it will be bad. Trust me.  Then put that pot in a larger pot, which has been filled slightly less than halfway with water. How far you\u2019ll need to fill it depends on the size of the pots.  Heat it slowly until it reaches 160\u00b0F / 71\u00b0C, stirring occasionally. This took about 15 \u2013 20 minutes. We also didn\u2019t let the water boil. It started to for a few seconds, and I spotted a bubble in the liqueur and immediately took it off to prevent it from becoming overdone. Do NOT let the liqueur boil! Or the water!Egg experts recommend 160\u00b0F as a safe temperature, and that if you let it go above 185\u00b0F / 85\u00b0C it\u2019ll become scrambled eggs. So please, be really careful and stop cooking at 160\u00b0F / 71\u00b0C! Add your vanilla if you didn\u2019t use vanilla sugar.Run some hot water over the outside of your bottles and then dry it off. We did this just to make sure that the bottles wouldn\u2019t crack.Don\u2019t fill the bottles absolutely to the top.
