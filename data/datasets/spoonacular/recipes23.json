combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Whisk or beat together for about 30 seconds.In a measuring cup, whisk together the milk, strawberry puree,egg whites, and vanilla extract until well blended.Add the butter, one chunk at a time, into the flour mixture with the mixer on low speed. Continue mixing until the butter is incorporated and the mixture resembles moist crumbs.Add all but 1/3 cup of the milk mixture into the crumbs and beat on medium speed for about 90 seconds.Add the rest of the milk mixture and beat for another 30 seconds on medium speed.Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula and beat for 20 more seconds.Divide the batter equally between the 3 pans (I used a kitchen scale to do this) and bake for 20-23 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes on wire racks.Turn the cakes out of the pans and cool completely on wire racks before frosting.With an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium high (or medium with a stand mixer) until light and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.Add the confectioner's sugar and malted milk powder and beat on low speed until combined.Turn the mixer up to medium high and beat for an additional 2-3 minutes.Add the vanilla, salt, and strawberry puree and mix until incorporated.Add the heavy cream one tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency.Place one layer of the cake on a foil covered 6-inch cake board.Spread about 1/2 cup of frosting evenly over the top.Add the second layer and do the same.Place a generous scoop of frosting on the top of the cake, and spread evenly across the top of the cake with an offset spatula. Using a turntable, work your way around the sides until the entire cake is covered with a thin layer of frosting.  Let the crumb coat set in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Once the crumb coat has set, spread a thicker layer of frosting on the top and sides of the crumb coat to create a smooth finish.Top with

Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside. Cake\u00a0- In a large bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, optional salt; set aside. In a large measuring cup or separate small bowl, whisk together the next 5 wet ingredients (through vanilla). Add the wet mixture to the dry, mixing lightly with a spoon until just combined. Small lumps will be present and this is okay. Don't overmix or try to stir them smooth; set aside. Batter will be on the thicker side. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Watch your cake, not the clock, and always bake until done, whatever that means in your climate and oven, given the ingredients you used. Remove pan from oven and carefully place 9 mini donuts on the surface, spaced uniformly and evenly. Using your palm or fingertips, lightly smoosh donuts onto the cake to help them stick. Return pan to over and bake for about 2 more minutes. This helps set donuts into the cake so they won't slide around. Remove pan from oven and place on a wire rack and allow cake to cool for at least 20 minutes in pan before optionally glazing. While cake cooks, makes the glaze. Glaze\u00a0- In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and heat on high power to melt, about 45 seconds. Add about 1 heaping cup confectioners' sugar and whisk until smooth. Depending on desired consistency, continue to add sugar until desired consistency is reached. If you accidentally add too much, add a splash of cream or milk to thin. Alternatively, try\u00a0buttery vanilla glaze\u00a0or\u00a0browned butter glaze. Evenly drizzle the glaze over the cake before slicing and serving. If you only plan to consume a small portion of this cake or plan to keep it around for a few days, you may wish to glaze it in portions and as needed, rather than all at once or in advance. Cake will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days. I'm comfortable storing glazed cakes at room temperature, but if you're not, glaze only the portion you plan to consume immediately.

neatly against the base and up the sides. The parchment paper will make it easy for you to slice the bars later.Toast the almonds for maximum flavor (you can skip this step, but your bars won't be quite as awesome): In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds, stirring frequently, until they are fragrant and starting to turn lightly golden on the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer them to a medium mixing bowl.To the mixing bowl, add the oats, coconut flakes, cinnamon and salt. Stir until blended.In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, measure out 1 cup almond butter. Top with  cup honey, followed by the vanilla extract. Whisk until well blended. (If you must, you can gently warm the liquid mixture in the microwave or on the stovetop.)Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Use a big spoon to mix them together until the two are evenly combined and no dry oats remain. The drier the mixture, the more firm the bars will be, so stir in extra oats if the mixture seems wet. Conversely, if you used a super thick almond butter (cough, Justin's), you might need to drizzle in another tablespoon of honey to help it all stick together.Transfer the mixture to the prepared square baker. Use your spoon to arrange the mixture fairly evenly in the baker, then use the bottom of a flat, round surface (like a short, sturdy drinking glass) to pack the mixture down as firmly and evenly as possible. (If the mixture keeps sticking to the glass, cover the base of the glass with a small square of parchment paper.)Cover the baker and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight. This gives the oats time to absorb moisture so the granola bars can set.When youre ready to slice, lift the bars out of the baker by grabbing both pieces of parchment paper on opposite corners. Use a sharp chef's knife to slice the mixture into 4 even rows and 4 even columns (these \"bars\" stick together better in a square shape).For portability, you can wrap individual bars in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Bars keep well for a couple of days at room temperature, but I recommend storing individually wrapped bars in a freezer-safe bag in the freezer for best flavor.

Continue to microwave for 10 seconds at a time, stirring between each interval until mixture is melted. Don\u2019t over microwave or the chocolate will burn.

Remove brownies from pan and cut in to 9 even squares, then take each square and slice it in half to make a top and a bottom layer for your sandwich. Scoop one scoop of ice cream on to one half of brownie and spread it evenly over the brownie half with the back of a spoon. Top ice cream with the other brownie half and press firmly to make sure the sandwich is sealed. Finish with remaining brownies and place in the freezer for at least 30 minutes to firm back up.In a small microwave safe bowl melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil together. This takes about 2 minutes on high, but stir every 20 seconds to make sure that your chocolate doesn't burn. Remove sandwiches from freezer.

In a large heavy-based pan, heat a couple of glugs of olive oil until hot. Cover the veal shins with enough seasoned flour to coat. Fry them in the oil until nice and brown on both flat sides. Remove and set aside.Pour a glug of olive oil into a separate heavy-based pan and add the chopped carrots, celery and one of the onions. Sweat these slowly and add the chopped rosemary, thyme leaves, garlic and a good pinch of salt and grind of pepper.When the vegetables are starting to stick, add the glass of white wine and allow to bubble away for 2 minutes, scraping all the good bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the chopped tomatoes and a cup of water and bring to the boil. Now, transfer everything to a large roasting tray with the browned meat. Make sure all of it is covered with the tomato mix and cover with foil. Place in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, or until meat is almost falling off the bone.When there are about 30 minutes to go with the veal shins, you should make the risotto. Put a glug of oil and half the butter in a saucepan and in it slowly saut\u00e9 the other chopped onion until it becomes translucent and glossy. This will take about 15 minutes on a low heat. Meanwhile, heat up the vegetable stock in another saucepan.Add the rice to the onion and stir for 2 minutes, coating every grain. Add the glass of vermouth. This will create a large cloud of steam and a wonderful smell as it evaporates. Add a large ladle of the hot stock and let the rice absorb the liquid, stirring all the while.At this point, delicately scatter the pinch of saffron into the rice. Add another ladle to cover the rice and repeat this process as the rice absorbs the stock and the grains release their starch and the whole mixture takes on a delightful creamy consistency. After 15 minutes or so, taste the rice \u2013 it should be creamy but still have a slight bite.When the rice is done, remove from the heat and carefully fold in the Parmesan and the remaining butter. Cover and let the whole thing rest for a few minutes.Take the veal from the oven and remove the foil. The meat should be practically falling off the bone. Serve the risotto onto each of the 6 plates and place a veal shin on top of each mound of yellow rice. Spoon the sauce onto the meat and serve.Try out these veal recipes for dinner on Food Republic:Basic Osso Buco RecipeVeal With Fava Bean Butter RecipeRoasted Veal Chops With Artichokes Recipe",

Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.Place the beef in a deep, non-reactive bowl (glass, plastic, or ceramic). Pour marinade over beef. The marinade should be at least halfway up the sides of the roast. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning the meat in the marinade at least twice each day.Take the beef out of the marinade and dry it. Strain the marinade and reserve the liquid. Discard the vegetables and spices.In a 7- to 8-quart pot or dutch oven over medium-hight heat, add the oil and butter and get to almost smoking. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper.Add the beef to the pot and sear to brown on all sides, about 2 or 3 minutes per side. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion. Cook until onion has softened.Add 1 cup of water to the strained marinade. Pour in enough of the marinade so it is about 1- to 1 1/2-inch deep around the beef.Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook on low until done, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.Remove the beef from the pot and let set for 10 to 15 minutes. Slice the beef and place on a serving platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.Add the beef base/bouillon to the pot and stir. Bring the sauce to a simmer.To thicken the sauce, slowly add in a portion of the dissolved cornstarch, whisking while pouring. Allow it to cook for 1 to 2 minutes and add more if too thin.Add the sour cream to the sauce and whisk to combine. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the baby bell peppers in a single layer and cook, turning, until the skins blister and start browning, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.Add the onion, poblano, garlic, cumin, oregano, ancho and chipotle chile powders and 1 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the onion and poblano are tender, about 8 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high and add the pork. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; let cool.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Make a slit in each baby bell pepper with a paring knife, cutting from stem to tip. Crumble the meat mixture into small bits, then stir in the cilantro and cheese. Stuff 2 to 3 teaspoons of the meat mixture into each pepper using your fingers or a small spoon; transfer to a baking sheet. (The peppers can be stuffed up to 4 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before baking.)Bake until the peppers are hot and the cheese melts, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and serve with lime wedges.Photograph by David Malosh                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

You want it frozen. The key to good dough, I learned this time around, is keeping everything very cold. That keeps the butter in chunks and therefore creates an awesome flaky crust.2) Take out the butter after an hour and put it in a food processor with the dry ingredients and pulse. I don't have a large food processor so I had to work in two batches. If you don't have a food processor you will have to wait a bit for the butter to melt before you can blend it with the other ingredients. Or you could maybe chop it up with a knife.3) Add your water next, one tablespoon at a time. I have no idea how much it will take but you don't want to add too much. When your dough is holding together, split it into two balls, wrap them in saran wrap, and back in the freezer. You want that butter to re-solidify. You can leave them in the freezer for infinity or at least one hour.4) For filling, peel apples and slice. Toss apples with other ingredients in a colander.

cold salted water. Place over high heat, bring to a boil, and then lower to a simmer. Cook until very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well and place in a food processor. Add the olive oil, yogurt and salt. Puree until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.For the salmon: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with the salt. Place the fillets in the pan, flesh-side down, and sear undisturbed for 3 to 4 minutes to create a golden brown crust. Gently flip, and cook for another 2 minutes.Salad: In a small bowl, mix together the chopped fennel fronds and parsley and the crispy capers.To plate, spread a little of the fennel puree on each of 4 plates. Top with a salmon fillet. Place a little salad on top of each salmon. Squeeze a bit of lemon over the top if desired. Serve immediately.                                                Crispy Capers:                                        Heat 1/4-inch vegetable oil in a small, straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers when swirled. (You can make sure the oil is hot enough by adding one caper to the oil; if it immediately starts to sizzle and pop, the oil is hot enough.) Add the capers to the hot oil and fry until they have popped open and turned golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove the capers to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.

Mix the Bisquick and milk until a dough forms.  Sprinkle some of the Bisquick on a cutting board.  Lay the dough mixture on the cutting board and knead the dough 10 times.  Roll the dough so that it\u2019s approximately 1 inch thick.Using a biscuit cutter (or the rim of a glass if you don\u2019t have one) cut 5 pieces of the biscuit dough.  You may just get 3 or 4 biscuits out of your first cut.  Then reroll the scraps and cut the remaining 1 or 2 pieces of biscuit dough.  Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 7 to 9 minutes.  Let cool before slicing them horizontally.For the Sausage:  Make patties of sausage.  They tend to shrink a bit after cooking so make them a bit larger than the diameter of the biscuit and as thin as possible (the entire package of sausage should yield 7 so you should have 2 extra).  Cook the sausage.  After the sausage patties are cooked, lay them on a paper towel to get rid of the excess grease.For the Eggs:  A microwave egg cooker is a handy way to make eggs in a size that fits well in a biscuit.  If you don\u2019t have one of these handy gadgets an option is to make fried eggs and just fold them so they fit in the biscuit.If you have a microwave egg cooker, put the egg cooker on a plate that is safe to go in the microwave.  Then put an egg in each cup and poke holes in the yoke with a fork.  Then add a smidgen of water in each one of the cups with the eggs, and snap the egg cooker closed and put a paper towel over the top.  Cook for 1 minute 38 seconds (time may vary depending on the microwave).  Remove the eggs from the cooker with a spoon.For the Cream Cheese:  Cut 10 fairly thick pieces (approximately 3/4 or more of the package).Assemble the Sandwich:  Spread butter and raspberry jam/jelly on each slice of the biscuit (both the top and bottom slices).  Put a slice of cream cheese over the raspberry jam on the top slice of the biscuit.  To the bottom slice of each biscuit, add another slice of cream cheese, a sausage patty, and an egg.Salt and pepper the egg to taste.  Cover with the top slice of the biscuit.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/breakfast-biscuit-sandwich-479304", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 5, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Running to the Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Dark-chocolate-amaretto-fudge-cookies-588242.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 588242, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Dark chocolate amaretto fudge cookies", "preparationMinutes": 130, "creditText": "Running to the Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon almond extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "almond extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002050, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup chopped dark chocolate", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "dark chocolate", "metaInformation": ["dark", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19904, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup gluten free baking flour", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "gluten free all purpose baking flour", "metaInformation": ["gluten free"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-flour-or-other-gluten-free-flour.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93620, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons amaretto liquor", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "liquor", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rum-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 14037, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup organic turbinado sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "turbinado sugar", "metaInformation": ["organic"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19908, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 5.0, "id": 19165, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 12.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.runningtothekitchen.com/2013/12/dark-chocolate-amaretto-fudge-cookies/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 505, "instructions": "Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and chopped chocolate in a bowl, set aside.Melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat.

Add remaining 1 cup flour a little at a time, just until the mixture forms a soft dough (you may not need the full cup.) If using a stand mixer, switch to a dough hook and mix on medium-low speed for about 10 minutes until smooth, adding a little flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the bowl. If kneading by hand, turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead for 12 minutes, incorporating additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. Place the kneaded dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic and allow it to rest in a warm, draft-free place for 30 minutes.Place rack in the upper third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or dust with cornmeal or flour. Turn risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 10-inch circle (it will be a little thick). Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet, then press lightly all over with your finger tips to create \u201cdimples.\u201d Brush crust all over with 1 tablespoon melted butter and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bake until pale golden and lightly crisp, about 20 minutes.While the pizza bakes, prepare the peanut butter sauce: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, butter, vanilla, and salt. Stir until the butter melts and the sauce is smooth and pourable.Remove pizza from oven and immediately sprinkle with semi-sweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chunks. Scatter marshmallows all over the top, then return to oven for 1 minute, until the chocolate begins to melt and the marshmallows turn lightly golden. Drizzle with peanut butter sauce and top with honey roasted peanuts. Slice and serve immediately. Share with friends.
