Cook until the caramel is very dark, and almost smoking, which should take about 10 minutes. Standing back with caution, add the cream and milk to the caramel. This will probably make the mixture seize up at first, but if you keep whisking and let it heat back up, it will combine. Bring this mixture back up to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium.In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolks, and cornstarch. Now we're going to temper the caramel mixture into the eggs by adding a cup of caramel to the eggs, whisking constantly, then pouring the egg mixture back into the pan. Increase the heat to bring this mixture to a boil, and keep whisking as the custard thickens from the cornstarch, which should take about two minutes.Remove the pan from the heat and add the butter and rum.

garnish, optionalDried parsley flakes, for garnish, optionalInstructionsIn a large soup pot, saut the carrots, onion, celery and garlic in oil over medium high until veggies soften. Add the ground beef and cook through; drain off any excess fat, if needed.Add the tomatoes, along with the juice, salt, both peppers, basil, and oregano; cook and stir over medium high, about 5 minutes. Add the water, stock, beef base, Worcestershire and Kitchen Bouquet, if using. Increase to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the vegetables, bring back up to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and continue to cook until veggies are cooked or warmed through. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.Soup can be served at this point, or reduce heat to low and let it slow simmer an hour or more, stirring occasionally, until you are ready to eat! Cook egg noodles, or your favorite pasta separately, according to package directions; drain. Spoon noodles into soup bowls, ladle soup over top of noodles and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve with homemade bread, or crusty rolls.Crockpot: Saut veggies, brown and drain ground beef, transfer to slow cooker. Add remaining ingredients (except for noodles and garnishes) down to the veggies, cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.Tip: You can save leftover bits and pieces of vegetables from meals in a small container in the freezer. As you have leftover veggies, continue layering them into the container.

Add chicken broth to the pot and simmer for about 20 minutes.Dissolve the cornstarch in the cold water. Add mixture to the broth. Add the noodles and bring to a rolling boil. Check noodles every few minutes and remove from heat when noodles are mostly cooked. The noodles will continue to soften after you stop the boiling. If you boil for too long, they'll get mushy and break apart easily.Add butter and herbs and stir to combine. Mix in chicken and season with salt and pepper. Mixture will thicken slightly as it cools; there should be enough of a thick broth to cover everything but not enough to be runny.
