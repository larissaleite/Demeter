Allow to cool slightly on the cookie sheet, then move to a wire rack to cool completely.After the cookies are cooled, use a double boiler or the microwave to melt the chocolate chips.  Stir until smooth.  Using a small, offset spatula, spread a thin layer of melted chocolate onto each cookie.  Place cookies on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes or until the chocolate layer has hardened.Meanwhile, rough-chop 1/3 of the mint candies.  Melt the white chocolate chips using the same double boiler or microwave method.  Carefully spread a layer of white chocolate over the cookie, and sprinkle with the chopped candies.

        Boil the pasta until cooked, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain out the water and place the pasta back into the pot. Take the sliced cheeses and cube them.In a separate saucepan, fry the onions in the butter until translucent and soft. Add the flour and whisk repeatedly, making a roux, until the mixture is golden brown. Add the milk and let simmer, stirring occasionally so it does not burn or stick, until the sauce thickens. When the sauce starts to thicken, add the American, Cheddar, Romano and 4 ounces of the Cheddar Jack. Stir until the cheeses melt and make a thick cheese sauce. Stir in the salt and black pepper, and pour the sauce over the pasta. Add the hot sauce, and mix thoroughly until the pasta is completely mixed with the sauce. Place in the refrigerator and let cool.Shape the beef into 4 patties. (Sprinkle with salt and pepper if you wish.) In a fry pan or skillet over medium-high heat, cook the burgers to your desired doneness.In a separate fry pan, make four 4-ounce portions of the mac and cheese, placing them flat in the pan, like little mac and cheese pancakes. Warm them up and cover them with the remaining Cheddar Jack. The cheese should melt and become crispy on the bottom. Using a spatula, place the mac and cheese discs on top of the burgers, and then top with 2 strips of bacon on each. Put the burgers on the buns and enjoy your very own Mac Attack!This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe.

Set the potatoes aside to cool.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, place the parsnips, celery root, and onions in a food processor and pulse them until finely chopped. Heat the schmaltz or oil in a large saute pan over medium heat, add the chopped vegetables and the bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are completely tender, then uncover and cook for another 10 minutes to let the liquid evaporate. Remove from heat; discard the bay leaves.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and pass them through a ricer into the sauteed vegetable mixture. Add the eggs and season with more salt and pepper; stir with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together. Let cool before forming the knishes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Make the Dough: Place 8 beaten eggs and the schmaltz or oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and add the mixture to the bowl of the stand mixer. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are mostly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough has a smooth, consistent texture, about 1 minute more.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Wrap the dough loosely in plastic wrap and flatten it into a disk. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. (The dough can also be frozen for up to 3 weeks; thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before proceeding.)                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Roll and Trim the Dough: Portion the dough approximately into thirds. Flatten one third with a rolling pin or the palm of your hand to approximately 1/4 inch thick. Pass it through a pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in half, if necessary, and pass it through the rollers 1 or 2 more times until the results yield a piece that is close to the width of the machine (about 6 inches).                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Adding flour as necessary to prevent sticking, continue to pass the dough through the machine, making the setting more narrow with each pass until you achieve a piece that is approximately 1/16 inch thick. Place the dough on a floured surface and cut it into squares. Reserve the trimmings and incorporate into the next piece of dough to be rolled. Repeat with the other two-thirds of the dough.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Stuff and Bake the Knishes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil a 10- by 15-inch baking sheet. Distribute about 1 cup of the filling evenly along one edge of a trimmed dough piece. Roll the dough around the filling to make a cylinder, using a spatula to help lift the bottom of the dough from the work surface where the dough is sticking. Brush the seam of the rolled knish with the egg wash and press lightly to seal it. Place the knish seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces and filling.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Make 4 or 5 diagonal slashes across the top of each knish to allow for expansion while cooking. Brush each knish with a little of the egg wash and sprinkle it with the topping of your choice. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Slice each knish into 4 small logs and serve with the mustard.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mile-ends-knishes-201439", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes":

"instructions": "Prepare the macarons: Place one baking sheet on top of the other to insulate the cookies, and place a silicon baking sheet or parchment paper on the top baking sheet.Mix almond flour and powdered sugar together in a food processor for 3 minutes, until you get a nice, powdery texture. Sift mixture into a large bowl.Stir one egg white into the ground almond mixture using a flat, rubber spatula. Mix until you get a paste that is consistent in texture. Set aside.Whisk the remaining two egg whites on high speed in a large mixing bowl until you achieve soft peaks. Set aside.Pour water, rosewater and granulated sugar into a small pan and place on your stove on high heat with the candy thermometer dipped into the mixture. Allow to boil until it reaches 230\u00b0F, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.Resume whisking the egg whites on med-high speed and slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the bowl. Beat for about 10 minutes, or until you end up with a puffy and shiny meringue.Quickly fold meringue mixture into the almond paste for 30 seconds, then slowly to check the consistency.The resulting mixture would be thick, fluffy and viscous. It will not be watery. It will almost feel and look like marshmallow fluff. DO NOT OVERMIX!Transfer meringue mixture into a pastry bag.Pipe mixture onto your lined baking sheet. Create small domes about 1\u00bd inch in diameter, 2 inches apart from each other to allow for spreading while baking.Rap the baking sheet firmly against the counter, making sure to do it in one swift movement. This helps form the \u201cfeet,\u201d or little fluffy edge to the cookies.Place your oven rack in the top part of your oven and preheat to 300\u00b0F. Allow to preheat for at least half an hour, ideally for the duration of the next step.Dry the batter at room temperature, uncovered, for 25 minutes. The circles should not stick to your finger when you touch them. If they do, let them dry a little longer.Place baking sheet into the oven and bake for 12 minutes.The cookies should be easy to peel off the pan. If not, put return the baking sheet into the oven for 2 more minutes.The baked cookies have a smooth top, a soft center and a cute little \u201cfoot.\u201dPrepare the buttercream: Mix butter in a medium bowl until light and fluffy. Add powdered sugar and eat for a few seconds with a hand mixer.Pour in rose water and lemon juice, then mix gently with a spatula. Beat with a hand mixer until evenly colored, about 30 seconds.Assemble the macarons: Lay down half of the cookies, face up, on a piece of parchment. Spread buttercream on the flat side of the cookies and top with the flat side of another cookie to form a sandwich.

Trim the sides of the eggplant and slice lengthwise into 4 large thin steaks or eggplant cutlets, 1/4-inch thick. Salt the eggplant on both sides and drain on a towel for 20 minutes, turning occasionally.In a shallow dish combine the juice of 1 lemon with the vinegar and Dijon. Whisk in 3 tablespoons olive oil, and season the dressing with pepper. Pat the eggplant dry and turn in the dressing, and cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.Char the peppers evenly over a flame or under the broiler to blacken the skins all over. Cover and cool to handle. Wipe off the skins, seed and slice the peppers into long strips. Combine the peppers with the capers, thyme, chopped garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and some salt and pepper.In a shallow dish combine the breadcrumbs with the granulated garlic, onion and nutmeg. Mix in the grated parm and parsley. Remove the eggplant and press to coat in breadcrumbs.Heat 1/2-inch of frying oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant until crispy and deeply golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Serve with the lemon wedges and side of peppers.Get Rachael's shopping list for this episode's recipes here.

vanilla in a food processor and puree until smooth; set aside.Make the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Generously coat a 10- to 15-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk the vegetable oil, sour cream, eggs, food coloring, vanilla, vinegar and 1/4 cup water in a medium bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined.Spread 3 cups of the batter in the prepared Bundt pan. Pour in the cream cheese swirl mixture, then spoon the remaining cake batter evenly over the top. Bake until the top is cracked and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 20 minutes in the pan, then carefully invert onto a plate and let cool completely, at least 2 hours.Make the glaze: Combine the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, sour cream, vanilla and salt in a food processor and puree until smooth. Pour and spread on the cooled cake.

Meanwhile, prepare the dressing by adding all dressing ingredients into a blender and blending on high speed until smooth.</p><p>7.

syrup or honey, and 1/2 teaspoon salt), and set aside.  Conversely, use the poppy seed recipe below or your favorite vinaigrette.Rinse millet in a fine mesh strainer and drain well. Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a medium pot and add the millet.  Reduce heat to low, cover with tight-fitting lid, and cook for 15 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the grains are fluffy but not mushy.  (I recommend checking a few minutes early so as not to overcook.  Don't stir; just check to see it the water has been absorbed.  If it has been, remove from heat.  If not, replace lid and cook a few minutes more.)  Once cooked, remove from heat, fluff with a fork, and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes.  Then remove lid, fluff again, and allow to cool.Meanwhile, in a very large skillet--I like using a large cast iron skillet--saut the leek in the 1 tablespoon olive oil for about 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the asparagus and saut for another 5 minutes, depending on thickness, or until the asparagus is tender but still a bit crisp. Add the snap peas during the last two minutes.  Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper.Remove the pan from the heat.  Stir in the cooked millet, the greens, optional strawberries, feta and drizzle with all of the vinaigrette or about 1/3-1/2 cup of the poppy seed dressing.  Toss to evenly distribute.If desired garnish with a hearty sprinkling of almonds and a grating of fresh lemon zest.Mix all ingredients and store in a jar in the refrigerator.Let stand at room temperature for a few minutes before using and shake well. The dressing will keep at least a week in the refrigerator, longer if you omit the onion.Note: I have tried this dressing with agave syrup instead of sugar. It is good, but I do prefer the regular sugar. You only need to lightly coat the greens to capture the wonderful flavor.
