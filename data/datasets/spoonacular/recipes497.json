Begin whipping the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on low speed. As the whites start to look wet and frothy, after about 45 seconds, add cream of tartar and salt and allow it to dissolve with the mixer still on low speed, about 10 seconds.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While the whites are still frothy, slowly begin to add the sugar in a steady stream with the mixer on low. Once you've added about 1/4 cup of the sugar, increase the speed to medium and continue to gradually add the sugar as the mixer runs.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whisk until the meringue is thick and glossy and holds firm peaks when you lift the whisk out of it, about 4 minutes. If it's not there yet, continue to whip the meringue on high speed at 30 second intervals and test again.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once the meringue is at firm peak stage, spoon a tiny dot of it onto each of the four corners of a baking sheet and press the parchment paper liner down over it. This will anchor the parchment paper.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Carefully fold the chocolate into the meringue with a rubber spatula, taking care not to deflate it.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Spoon 1 1/2 inch to 2 inch dollops of the meringue mixture onto the baking sheet, spaced one inch apart. Try to shape the meringues with a spoon so they have crags and ridges all over.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bake until the meringues harden on the outside, develop cracks and are only slightly moist on the inside, about 2 hours (this can vary widely depending on your oven). To test for doneness, remove one meringue, allow to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes, then break open to check texture. The center should only be slightly moist at this point.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Allow the meringues to cool on a wire rack.

Kitchen of Deep South DishPrep time: 10 min |Cook time: 2 hours 15 min |Yield: About 4 to 6 servingsFor the Ham Stock:1 large meaty hambone3 quarts of water2 whole celery stalks (ribs) with leaves, rinsed and cut into large chunks2 large carrots, unpeeled, rinsed and cut into large chunks1 large onion, unpeeled and quartered4 sprigs of fresh parsley2 bay leaves1/2 teaspoon of whole peppercornsFor the Dumplings:3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening1-1/2 cups of self-rising flour1/2 cup buttermilk or milk1/4 cup of reserved ham stockSalt, only if needed, to tastePlace ham bone in a large stockpot, along with the remaining stock ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours or until mixture is reduced to about 1-1/2 quarts. Strain, reserving the bone and stock; discard vegetables. Once cooled, pick off any meat from the bone, reserving the meat and discarding the bone. Refrigerating the stock overnight is best when possible.When ready to prepare dumplings, set aside 1/4 cup of the stock. Mix together the dumpling ingredients until they form a soft dough. Bring ham stock to a rolling boil. Using a small spoon, scoop out and drop into boiling broth and cover immediately so that the dumplings begin to steam; simmer on low about 10 minutes before checking. Don't overcook or dumplings will be dense and hard. Taste broth and adjust seasonings if needed, adding freshly cracked black pepper. Carefully scoop broth and a few dumplings into individual serving bowls.Cook's Notes: May substitute 2 or 3 meaty ham hocks. If the bone or hocks you use are not very meaty, add in about 1 to 1-1/2 cups of chopped, smoked ham.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South

Serve at room temperature or chilled.Tips & NotesMake Ahead Tip: Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.Tip: Melon selection & storage: Look for symmetrical unblemished melons, without flat sides, that have a creamy yellow spot on the bottom indicating ripeness. At 92% water, this fruit should feel heavy when you heft it. Precut melon flesh should be dense, firm and appear moist. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week or keep in a cool, dark spot. Cover the cut surface of melon with plastic wrap and refrigerate.NutritionPer serving: 116 calories; 5 g fat (1 g sat, 4 g mono);0 mg cholesterol; 18 g carbohydrates; 0 g added sugars; 2 g protein; 2
