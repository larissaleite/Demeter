canola oil in a saucepan over high heat. Add the onions and cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stirring constantly, add the ketchup, pepper jelly, vinegar, honey, Worcestershire, mustard and some salt and pepper and cook until warmed through. (At this point, either use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for a few days.)Add the meat to the warm sauce. Stirring well, cook until the sauce and meat are heated through, about 5 minutes.For the fried onions: Heat the canola oil in a large saucepan until it registers 350 degrees F on a candy or deep-frying thermometer.Mix some salt into the flour and spread on a plate. Dredge the onion rings in the flour and drop them one-by-one into the oil until you have a small batch. Cook until the rings are golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining onions.To assemble the sandwiches: toast the buns, spoon the saucy meat onto the buns and top with onion rings, lettuce and tomato slices.

Butter 3 9-inch round baking pans and line the bottom of each with a round of parchment paper. Butter parchment paper and lightly dust pan with flour, shaking out excess.Sift cake flour into a mixing bowl. Add all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and whisk for 30 seconds, set aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment (if you don't have the paddle attachment that constantly scrapes sides of the bowl while mixing, then stop mixer occasionally throughout entire mixing process and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl), whip together butter, granulated sugar and lemon zest until mixture is pale and fluffy. In a 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure out milk then stir in sour cream and lemon juice, let rest 3 minutes. Meanwhile, mix eggs into butter mixture one a time, then stir in lemon extract and vanilla extract. Toss blueberries with 3 Tbsp of the flour mixture. Working in three separate batches, beginning and ending with remaining flour mixture, add 1/3 of the flour mixture alternating with 1/2 of the milk mixture and mixing just until combined after each addition.  Gently fold in blueberries. Divide mixture evenly among prepared baking pans. Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 24 - 27 minutes. Cool in baking pans about 20 - 30 minute then invert onto wire racks to cool completely. Once cool, frost with cream cheese frosting and decorate with blueberries and lemon slices if desired. Store in an airtight container.Cream Cheese Frosting:In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitter with the paddle attachment, whip butter until pale and fluffy. Add cream cheese and mix until smooth and fluffy. Add vanilla and lemon extract and powdered sugar and blend several minutes longer until smooth and fluffy (if frosting seems slightly runny, you can chill it for a bit before frosting cake).

Shake off any excess batter and carefully place the fries in the fryer; cook until golden brown and tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer the fries to the prepared sheet pan and season with salt. Set aside, and repeat for the remaining fries.Preheat a grill or grill pan to high heat and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Remove the steak from the marinade and brush with some canola oil.

occasionally with tongs until blackened on all sides. Place them in a medium bowl, and cover with plastic wrap, set aside until cool; rub off the blackened skin, remove stems and seeds, then roughly chop them.Prepare the gazpacho: Place roasted red bell pepper, roasted fresno chile, tomatoes and their juice, cucumber, onion, half the smoked almonds, bread, sherry vinegar, garlic, smoked paprika, smoked salt and pepper in a blender. Process until as smooth as you like, adding a splash of water if necessary to achieve the proper consistency. It should move freely in the blender, but not be watery (add one ingredient at a time and blend thoroughly before adding another if all the ingredients don\u2019t initially fit).Once all the ingredients are smooth, drizzle in the olive oil with the machine running until fully incorporated and emulsified.Taste and adjust the seasoning. Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to come together.To serve: Just before serving, Heat a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo slices and cook until they begin to curl at the edges and brown. Flip them over and cook until browned on the other side.Serve the chilled gazpacho in shallow soup bowl, garnished with chorizo slices, remaining chopped smoked almonds, parsley and a drizzle of very

Puree until smooth. Set aside.In a medium saucepan, bring the milk almost to a boil over medium heat. In a second medium saucepan, blend together the egg yolks, sugar and salt with a wooden spoon until thick and light (be careful not to make the mixture foamy). Slowly stir in half the hot milk, then transfer the mixture to the other saucepan with the remaining milk and stir until blended.Decrease the heat to low and cook gently, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Continue stirring the custard until thick enough to coat the back of the spoon and the mixture reaches 175 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the heat.Set a sieve over a large, clean bowl and pass the custard through the sieve. Discard any eggy solids. Add the peach puree and vanilla and stir to combine. Chill the custard completely over an ice bath made by filling a large bowl with ice cubes and water, or refrigerate it until chilled. Churn the ice cream according to the instructions for your ice-cream maker.

powder, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and orange zest until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until a sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. Meanwhile, roll out the dough until 1/2 inch thick on a floured surface. (The dough will be sticky.) Cut out rounds using a 1-inch-round cookie cutter, dipping the cutter in flour each time. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet.Set a rack on another baking sheet. Working in batches, carefully fry the doughnut holes until puffed and browned, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to the rack using a slotted spoon or wire strainer.Make the glaze: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately pour over the chocolate; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth, then whisk in the corn syrup and vanilla. Set aside until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes. Dip the doughnut holes in the glaze, transfer to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with nonpareils.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large, oven-safe high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. When the foam subsides, add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it has the consistency of wet sand, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the milk, little by little.Put the saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Lower the heat and whisk in 2 cups of the Cheddar, 2 cups of the Gruyere, the garlic, pepper and salt. Whisk until the cheese is melted, then stir in the nutmeg. Add the sliced potatoes to the pan. Scatter the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the remaining 1 cup Cheddar and 1 cup Gruyere over the top.Bake in the oven for 45 minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F., and bake until the potatoes are fork-tender and the top is bubbly and golden brown, about 15 minutes more. (Cover the dish with foil if the top becomes too dark before the potatoes are tender.) Scatter the chopped parsley over the top, and serve.

oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Mix the breadcrumbs with the milk in a small bowl and rest for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumb mixture, the beef, feta, Parmesan, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and eggs. Portion the meatballs into 3-ounce balls (16 meatballs total), then roll in your hands and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the meatballs start to brown, 15 minutes.For the hero: Place the tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and parsley in a bowl. Drizzle the olive oil and lemon juice into the bowl and gently toss the vegetables to coat. Season the salad with salt and set aside.Split the hero rolls lengthwise three-quarters of the way through (one end should still be connected). Toast the inside of the rolls on a hot griddle. Place the cooked meatballs on the griddle to crisp the outside and heat through. Place 4 meatballs in a toasted hero roll, then dollop 2 ounces of the tzatziki over the top, and finish with some of the salad. Repeat for the remaining hero rolls, then serve.

degrees F.Toss the tomatoes with the olive oil, vinegar and thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper. Put in a small baking dish in one layer and roast until completely soft and the juices have evaporated, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly. Leave the oven on.Heat the canola oil in a 10-inch nonstick pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the sausage and cook until golden brown, and then transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Remove the fat from the pan.Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Fold in the drained sausage, tomatoes, provolone and Romano cheeses, arugula and chopped parsley and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Season the ricotta with salt and pepper as well and set aside.Heat the butter in the nonstick pan. Add the egg mixture and stir to evenly distribute the ingredients using a heatproof rubber spatula. Cook until the eggs set on the bottom and around the sides of the pan, and then transfer to the oven. Bake until the eggs are cooked through and the top is lightly golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.Loosen around the sides of the pan with a rubber spatula and flip onto a serving platter or cutting board. Top with the ricotta and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Grind some black pepper over the top, and scatter the whole parsley leaves over all.

With a sharp knife remove most of the visible fat and gristle but do not discard. Disconnect the two large sections of lamb from each other. One will be the top of the leg and the smaller piece will be the bottom of the leg. Butterfly each section so that when laid flat, each piece is fairly uniform in thickness.On a cutting board place rosemary, mint, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon zest. Using the side of a knife, drag the blade over the mixture several times until you have a paste. (This does not have to be perfect). Put this in a small bowl along with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and all of the olive oil. Lay out the lamb and squeeze the remaining two teaspoons of lemon juice over both sides of both pieces. Next smear the paste over both sides of both pieces. Cover with plastic and let sit in the refrigerator for two hours.Take the fat scraps and gristle and place in a small sauce pan with a quart of water and bring to a boil. Simmer until there is about two cups of liquid left. Discard scraps and save broth. The fat will rise to the top and congeal and both the fat and stock will be used later.  Set mixture aside under refrigeration. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.Remove lamb from the refrigerator. Cover a sheet pan with foil and place a rack in the foil lined pan.Heat a ribbed pan on stove top to smoking hot. Spoon one tablespoon of the lamb fat into hot pan. Sear each piece one at a time for two to three minutes on each side until nice and browned. Place on rack in prepared pan and place probe thermometer into thickest part of largest piece. Place a few tablespoons of lamb fat over each piece. Place pan in oven and set the temperature to alarm at 135 for rare and 145 for medium.  (Best if cooked rare).  The cooking time will be about one hour for rare.Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Leave probe in meat until ready to slice.On a cutting board, slice the meat against the grain on the bias and serve with Israeli couscous and pan-roasted tomatoes.Note: The couscous can be started when the meat comes out of the oven since it only takes a about 10 minutes to cook. In a medium sauce pan place dry couscous, lamb broth, lamb fat, salt and pepper. Cover and cook 8-10 minutes until tender.

Place the nuts into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until nuts are finely ground.  Add remaining butter and sugar and pulse until the dough resembles coarse crumbs. Use your fingers and the flat bottom of a drinking glass to press the dough into an even layer in the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the tart is firm and golden brown, 12-15 minutes. Set aside.Make the almond cream: Whisk the sugar, flour and egg yolks until thick and smooth in a medium bowl. Bring the milk and almond extract to a gentle boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Pour about 1/2 of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, then pour the whole mix back into the pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5-8 minutes. Stir this mixture constantly, scraping the bottom as you stir, so the flour doesn't stick to the bottom and burn. Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap and cover it with a coating of plastic wrap so that it doesn't form a \"skin\". Refrigerate until completely cooled.Assemble the tart: Place the tart bottom on a serving platter. Spoon the pastry cream on top. Arrange the kiwi slices, raspberries and blueberries on top of the pastry cream and brush with the jam until the fruit is coated with it.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of sliced almonds.                                                             Note:  You can use a 9-inch springform pan in place of the tart pan, if desired. Build the crust so that it is one inch high on the sides of the pan.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle the yeast over the warmed milk and let it sit for a few minutes. Using the paddle attachment, stir in the softened butter, sugar, vanilla, and one cup of the flour. Stir in the salt, cardamom, and orange zest. Add in the eggs and enough of the remaining flour to make a soft yet sticky dough. Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is elastic and pliable. Spray the top of the dough with vegetable oil, and turn the dough over so it is coated in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a towel and allow the dough rise until nearly doubled - about an hour.2. In a small bowl, mix the sugars with the cardamom and ginger, then work in the orange zest with the tips of your fingers until the sugar resembles wet, soft sand. Stir in the orange juice.3. Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking dish with baking spray or butter. On a floured surface pat the dough out into a large yet still thick rectangle  about 10x15 inches. Spread evenly with the softened butter, then pour and spread the orange-sugar mixture over top. Roll the dough up tightly, starting from the top long end. Cut the long dough roll into 12 even rolls, and place them, cut side up, in the prepared baking dish.4. Cover the rolls with a towel and let them rise for an hour or until puffy and nearly doubled. (You can also refrigerate the rolls at this point. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to bake the rolls, remove the pan from the fridge, and let them rise for an hour.)5. Heat the oven to 350F. Place the risen rolls in the oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into a center roll reads 190F.6. While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze. In a medium bowl with an electric hand mixer, whip the cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla, orange zest and juice and blend until well combined. Add the powdered sugar and blend until smooth and creamy.7. When the rolls are done, spread them with the cream cheese glaze.

chopped.Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add beef, pork, pancetta, and vegetables; cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until moisture is almost completely evaporated and meat is well browned, 2530 minutes; season with salt and pepper.Add wine to pot and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, about 2 minutes. Add milk; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until moisture is almost completely evaporated, 810 minutes. Add tomatoes and 2 cups broth; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, adding water by -cupfuls if sauce looks dry, until flavors meld and sauce thickens, 23 hours.Let sauce cool, then cover and chill at least 12 hours or up to 2 days. (Letting the sauce sit will give it a deeper, richer flavor.)DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.Whisk salt and 3 cups flour in a large bowl, make a well in the center, and crack eggs into well. Mix eggs with a fork, then slowly mix in flour until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead, dusting lightly with flour if sticky, until smooth, about 5 minutes (it will be fairly stiff). Wrap in plastic; let sit until dough holds an indentation when pressed, 12 hours.Set pasta maker to thickest setting; dust lightly with flour. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining dough wrapped in plastic as you work, flatten dough into a narrow rectangle (no wider than mouth of machine); pass through rollers. Fold dough as needed to fit and run through again. Repeat without folding, adjusting machine to thinner settings after every pass and dusting with flour if sticky, until pasta sheet is 1/16 thick (setting 8 on most machines). Place pasta sheets on a lightly floured surface and cut crosswise into 16 8-long noodles.DO AHEAD: Dough can be made 1 day ahead; chill. Bring to room temperature before rolling out, about 1 hour. Noodles can be made 1 day ahead. Stack on a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper between each layer. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until foaming. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Whisk in warm milk, -cupful at a time. Bring sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, whisking often, until the consistency of cream, 810 minutes; add nutmeg and season with salt. Remove from heat, transfer to a medium bowl, and press plastic wrap directly onto surface; let cool slightly.DO AHEAD: Bchamel can be made 1 day ahead. Keep covered and chill.Reheat the sauces. Combine Bolognese sauce and remaining 1 cup broth in a large saucepan over medium heat, and heat until sauce is warmed through.Meanwhile, if you made the bchamel ahead of time, heat in a medium saucepan over low heat just until warmed through (you dont want to let it boil).Working in batches, cook fresh lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until just softened, about 10 seconds. Remove carefully with tongs and transfer to a large bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain noodles and stack on a baking sheet, with paper towels between each layer, making sure noodles dont touch (theyll stick together).Preheat oven to 350. Coat a 13x9 baking dish with butter.Spread  cup bchamel in the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of noodles, spread over a scant  cup Bolognese sauce, then  cup bchamel, and top with  cup Parmesan. Repeat process 7 more times, starting with noodles and ending with Parmesan, for a total of 8 layers. Place baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake lasagna until bubbling and beginning to brown on top, 5060 minutes. Let lasagna sit 45 minutes before serving.DO AHEAD: Lasagna can be assembled 12 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours before baking. Cook, covered with foil until the last 20 minutes, then finish cooking uncovered.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lasagna-bolognese-629948", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Closet Cooking", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Butternut-Squash-and-Parmesan-Pasta-with-Sage-247563.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 247563, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Butternut Squash and Parmesan Pasta with Sage", "creditText": "Closet Cooking", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 cups butternut squash puree (about 1 large butternut squash)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "butternut squash", "metaInformation": ["large", "( 1 butternut squash)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butternut-squash.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11485, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 cloves garlic (chopped)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["chopped", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup heavy cream (or Greek yogurt)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": ["(or Greek yogurt)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/8 teaspoon nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 2025, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 onion (diced)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup (packed) parmigiano reggiano (or pecorino, or gruyere, etc., grated)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "parmigiano reggiano", "metaInformation": ["packed", "grated", "()", "(or pecorino, or gruyere, etc., )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1033, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon sage (chopped)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sage", "metaInformation": ["chopped", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sage.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2038, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 pound pasta (I used whole wheat)", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "whole wheat pasta", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat", "(I used )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-wheat-spaghetti.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20124, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.closetcooking.com/2010/03/butternut-squash-and-parmesan-pasta.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "aggregateLikes": 265, "instructions": "Directions:1.

                          Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.In a small bowl combine the chopped rosemary, sage, garlic, red pepper flakes and olive oil. Season generously with salt. Using your fingertips carefully work your way under the skin of the chickens to separate the skin from the breast to develop a pocket. Schmear the herb paste under the skin of both chickens. Use all of the paste and try to distribute evenly. Drizzle each chicken with more olive oil and massage the skin. The idea here is to lube them up like suntan lotion. This will really help to get a nice brown crispy skin. Sprinkle each chicken generously with salt. Truss each chicken.Place the diced veggies, bay leaves and thyme bundle in a roasting pan large enough to accommodate the 2 chickens without touching. Usually a 9 by 13-inch roasting pan will be perfect. Add 2 cups of chicken stock and season generously with salt. Arrange the chickens on top of the veggies in the roasting pan and place in the preheated oven.Check the chickens about 15 minutes into the cooking process, the skin should be starting to turn a lovely brown. Lower the heat to 375 degrees F and continue roasting. After another 15 minutes, remove the chickens from the oven and turn over. At this point check the level of liquid in the roasting pan. If most of the liquid has evaporated, add another cup of stock and return the chickens to the oven. When the chickens have browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes, remove them from the oven and turn them back over. Return the chickens to the oven for the final 15 minutes of cooking. During this time the skin on the chickens should be very brown and crispy. Remove the chickens from the oven and take the temperature in the crease between the thigh and the breast. (When doing this be sure not to have the thermometer probe touch a bone or you will get an inaccurate reading.) The thermometer should read between 160 and 170 degrees F. When cooking poultry in general the rule is 17 minutes per pound. If the thermometer reads less than 160 degrees F return the chicken to the oven for an additional 10 minutes and then re-check the temperature.When chickens have reached the proper temp remove them from the roasting pan, place them on a warm platter and cover loosely with foil. Let sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes before carving.After the chickens have been removed from the roasting pan, skim off the excess fat from the surface of the liquid. The easiest way to do this is to prop up 1 end of the pan and allow the fat to run to the other end of the pan. You may not be able to get all of the fat, which is ok-fat tastes good! Put the roasting pan on a burner, add the wine, bring to a medium heat and reduce by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and taste. Add salt if needed- you probably will need salt. At this point you can decide if you are a \"strainer\" or not a strainer, meaning if you would like to strain the chunky vegetables out of the sauce or not. I myself, am not a strainer. When the sauce has reached the desired consistency and flavor remove from the heat and pour into desired serving vessel.To carve the chickens: Cut off the twine. Pull the thigh and leg away from the breast of the chicken until the thigh bone \"pops\" out of the socket. This is also a sign that the chicken is cooked properly. Separate the thigh and drumstick. Remove the breast from the carcass by feeling for the ridge of the breastbone in the center of the chicken and slicing around the rib cage. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter or on individual plates with the mashed potatoes and gravy.

Make the turnovers: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and celery, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook until the carrot softens, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently. Add the flour and cook off the raw flavor, about 1 minute more. Turn up the heat to medium high and deglaze the pan with the wine. Whisk in the stock and dijon mustard. Add the peas and chicken and cook at a very low simmer until the sauce thickens up into a gravy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.On a floured surface, unfold the puff pastry and cut into 4 squares (cut once horizontally and once vertically). Gently roll out each square, increasing the size of the square by about 20 percent. Place on a baking sheet and spoon the chicken mixture in the center. Fold the squares in half diagonally to create triangles. Pinch the edges together to create turnovers (use a little water if needed to bind). Press the edges with a fork to create a decorative border. Whisk the egg with a splash of water and brush the turnovers with the egg wash. Cut a small slit in the tops to allow the steam to escape during baking. Bake the turnovers until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving as the insides will be very hot.Meanwhile, make the salad: Rub the inside of a large wooden bowl with the garlic clove and then either discard it or save it for another use. Put the mustard in the bowl and whisk in the vinegar and soy sauce (a French secret!) vigorously for about 10 seconds to get a creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle in the olive oil as slowly as possible with one hand while whisking as quickly as possible with the other hand to emulsify. Lay the salad greens on top of the dressing and toss just before serving. Serve with the turnovers.

Once the nuts have cooled completely place them, along with 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of the flour from the recipe, into your food processor, fitted with a metal blade, and process until they are finely ground (but not a paste).                                                                                                                             3                                                                            For the cookies: In the bowl of your electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes). Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the remaining flour and salt and beat until combined. Stir in the nuts. Cover and refrigerate the dough for about one hour or until firm.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Form the chilled dough into 1 inch (2.5 cm) balls and place them 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for about 12 - 15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies start to brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Meanwhile, place the 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar in a bowl. Take the still hot cookies and roll them in the sugar, one at a time. Place on a wire rack to cool. Or you can simply place the confectioners sugar in a strainer and sift the sugar over the tops of the cookies. Let cool completely before storing.
