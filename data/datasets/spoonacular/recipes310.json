Allow the mixture to sit 5-10 mins or until the mix is foamy and smells like bread. To the bowl, add the butter and egg, mix a little to combine and then add 3 cups flour, the salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper. Knead the dough using a dough hook or your hands until the dough comes together and is smooth, about 3 minutes with a mixer and 5-10 by hand. If the dough seems too sticky, add the remaining 1/2 cup flour. The dough should come together, but be slightly sticky to touch. Grease a large bowl and place the dough ball inside. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place while you work on the filling, but at least 30 minutes.To make the filling, heat a medium size skillet over medium heat, add the butter. Add the apples, brown sugar and cinnamon, cook, stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes. Add the cider and continue to cook the apples until they are caramelized, about 5 minutes more. During the last minute add the vanilla and cook another minute or until the apples are all the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.When the dough is ready, lightly flour your work surface and scoop the dough out of the bowl and onto your surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread about 3/4 of the apples over half of the dough. Fold one half of the dough over the apple and press the edges together to seal lightly.Use your rolling pin to gently roll the dough back out into a rectangle just a little smaller than the original rectangle. Spread the remaining apples over one half of the dough and fold the other half over the edges. Press the edges together to seal. Now roll the dough out one more time, gently into a rectangle about an inch thick. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 16-18 squares. Use your hands to pull the four corners of each square towards the center, sealing the fritters into a rough ball. Don't worry about any apples falling out or if they are exposed.Place the shaped fritters on a parchment-lined baking sheet and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about 15 minutes or until the fritters puff and almost double in size.Meanwhile, heat a large pot of oil to 350-375 degrees F. Place a wire rack on a large rimmed baking sheetCarefully lower 3 to 4 fritters into the hot oil. Fry on one side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown, then flip the fritter and fry the other side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown.

Press softened berries through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds (alternatively, use a food mill fitted with a fine screen). You should have about 1 cup of blackberry puree. If you want a bit more texture, add back a spoonful or two of seeds if desired. In a bowl, whisk together sugar and pectin until evenly distributed. Return strained blackberry to saucepan; add lemon juice and calcium water. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a full rolling boil. Add sugar and pectin, stirring vigorously until completely dissolved. Continue to stir until jam returns to a full boil, which shouldn't take more than 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely, then refrigerate until ready to use (can be made a few days ahead of time). This recipe makes about 1 cup of jam, which is more than you'll need for the recipe, but I'm confident you'll find a way to use up the rest. :)For Sugar Cookie: In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter and shortening together on high speed until incorporated. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Add egg and extracts and mix until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. In a bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt until evenly incorporated. Add to mixing bowl and mix on low speed until no dry ingredients remain. Turn dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap; wrap tightly, shaping dough into a flat disk. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 8-by-8-inch square baking pans with parchment paper. Remove dough from refrigerator and cut in half; return second half to the fridge until you are ready to work with it. Place dough between two layers of generously floured plastic wrap or parchment paper. Roll to a 1/4-inch thick square as big as your square baking pan. Remove top layer of plastic wrap. Place baking pan on top and trace around the edge with a knife. Place parchment paper lining from pan on top of square of dough, and carefully invert, lining up edges. Remove plastic wrap and gently ease parchment and dough back into baking pan. Refrigerate while you repeat the process with the second half of your dough (or, if you only have one pan, bake one cookie first, let it cool, then take it out of the pan and repeat this process for the second cookie). Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until cookie is puffed and top is matte in appearance. Do not overbake (the cookie will not show signs of browning when you take it out of the oven). Let cookies cool in pans for 15 minutes, then gently lift out parchment lining and cookie together (keeping the cookie with its lining will make the assembly process easier). Place on a cooking rack and let cool completely. Freeze cookies (and at least one of the 8-by-8 baking pans) for at least 30 minutes or until ready to use. Making sure the cookies (and the baking pan for assembly purposes) are good and frozen will ensure the ice cream stays solid.For Ice Cream: Combine blackberries, cream, buttermilk, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in a food processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times until combined and mixture turns light purple; there should still be chunks of berries visible (do not puree). Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer instructions.To Assemble: While ice cream is churning, spread 1/4 cup of jam onto each frozen cookie. Place one cookie (along with the parchment it is stuck to) in the bottom of one 8-by-8-inch baking pan. This pan will serve as an assembly vessel for the final ice cream sandwiches. Return to freezer for at least 10 minutes or until ice cream is ready. When ice cream is the consistency of soft serve, spoon into baking pan on top of one jam-covered cookie, spreading into an even layer. Invert second cookie and gently place on top of ice cream, jam side down, pressing very lightly to adhere. Cover pan with foil or plastic wrap and freeze overnight or until solid. To serve, gently lift out entire block using parchment paper as a handle. Place on a cutting board and cut into squares using a large knife.

"Recipe: Southernized Baked ZitiFrom the Kitchen of Deep South DishPrep time: 40 min |Cook time: 1 hour 10 min |Yield: About 6 to 8 servingsIngredientsFor the Meatballs:1/2 pound of ground beef1/2 pound of Italian sausage, removed from the casings1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs2 large eggs1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder2 teaspoons of dried parsley1/4 cup of grated ParmesanKosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to tasteFor the Gravy:1 tablespoon of olive oil1 cup of chopped onion1/2 cup of chopped green bell pepper1/4 cup of chopped celery4 cloves of garlic, minced1-1/2 pounds of Italian sausage1 (28 ounce) can of whole tomatoes1 (15 ounce) can of diced or stewed tomatoes2 teaspoons of Italian seasoningKosher salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the Ziti:1 pound of ziti pasta1 cup of ricotta cheese1 large mozzarella ball, or about 4 cups shredded divided1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, dividedInstructionsFor the meatballs, combine ingredients and form into tiny meatballs, about the size of a cherry tomato. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes; set aside.Meanwhile, for the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, green pepper and celery. Cook until softened but not brown, add the garlic and cook another minute. Remove the sausage from the casings and add to skillet, breaking up the meat to fine crumbles. Cook over medium to medium high heat until lightly browned; drain off any excess fat. Using kitchen shears, roughly chop the tomatoes in the can, and add those along with the Italian seasoning to the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and let cook for about 30 minutes. Remove 2 cups of the sauce for layering and set aside.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and generously salt. Cook the pasta just to al dente according to package directions; drain. Once the ziti has stopped steaming, add it to the remaining sauce and combine well. Taste, add salt and pepper, and adjust seasoning as needed.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large oblong 4 quart baking dish, add half of the ziti mixture. Dollop the ricotta on top of the pasta and top with slices of fresh mozzarella, or use shredded. Reserve one cup or enough slices of the mozzarella for the top. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of that. Add half of the meatballs. Dot top with 1 cup of the reserved tomato sauce mixture and smear it around. Add the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining meatballs and the remaining sauce. Add another layer of mozzarella, reserving some for later, and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of that.Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and place a baking sheet on the rack below as insurance for any spillover. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 to 60 minutes or until bubbly. Uncover, sprinkle the top with the remaining mozzarella cheese and return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes, or until casserole is bubbly, cheese has melted and center is hot.Cook's Notes: Substitute your favorite homemade or commercial spaghetti sauce for this dish. You'll want about 4 to 5 cups of sauce. May also be made with the meat sauce only and omit the meatballs.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/southernized-baked-ziti-243560", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 110, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cup Cake Project", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Yogurt-and-Honey-Cupcakes--A-Taste-of-Greece-518940.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 518940, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Yogurt and Honey Cupcakes \u2013 A Taste of Greece", "pricePerServing": 52.01, "creditText": "Cup Cake Project", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18372, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "2 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 C all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 1.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1/4 C Greek yogurt (you could also use regular yogurt or sour cream)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["sour", "(you could also use regular yogurt or cream)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1256, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1/2 C honey (plus extra for topping)", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": ["for topping)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19296, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/3 C unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1145, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 25.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.cupcakeproject.com/2010/09/yogurt-and-honey-cupcakes-taste-of.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg", "id": 405907, "name": "mixing bowl"}], "step": "In a medium-sized mixing bowl, mix honey and melted butter together.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "id": 19296, "name": "honey"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Beat in eggs, one at a time.", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "id": 1123, "name": "egg"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png", "id": 404676, "name": "muffin liners"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Stir in vanilla and Greek yogurt.
