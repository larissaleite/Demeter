Scoop the filling into a quart-sized heavy zip baggie and set it aside (see *Tips below).Prepare the glaze:  In a small pan, heat the butter over low heat until melted. Turn off the heat and whisk in the cream cheese until it is almost smooth. Sift the powdered sugar into the pan, stir and add in vanilla extract.  Set the pan aside while you make the pancakes.Prepare the pancake batter:  In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk in the milk, egg and oil, just until the batter is moistened (a few small lumps are fine).Cook the pancakes:  Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-heat and spray with nonstick spray.  Use an ice cream scoop (or 1/3 cup measuring cup) to add the batter to the pan. Use the bottom of the scoop or cup to spread the batter into a circle (about 4-inches in diameter).  Reduce the heat to medium low.  Snip the corner of your baggie of cinnamon filling and squeeze the filling into the open corner. When your pancake begins to form bubbles, add the filling. Starting at the center of the pancake, squeeze the filling on top of the pancake batter in a swirl (just as you see in a regular cinnamon roll). Cook the pancake 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bubbles begin popping on top of the pancake and it's golden brown on the bottom. Slide a thin, wide metal spatula underneath the pancake and gently but quickly flip it over. Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until the other side is golden as well.  When you flip the pancake onto a plate, you will see that the cinnamon filling has created a crater-swirl of cinnamon. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel, and repeat with the remaining pancake batter and cinnamon filling. Re-warm the glaze briefly, if needed.

Pour over tofu and turn to coat. Chill at least 2 hours.Do Ahead: Tofu can be marinated  12 hours ahead. Cover and keep chilled.Place rice in a sieve and rinse under cold running water, rubbing with your fingers, until water runs clear. (This yields fluffy grains that wont clump.)

Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 1215 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and fluff rice with a fork. Cover with a kitchen towel, then replace lid. Let sit 10 minutes for steam to absorb. Pour oil into a medium pot to a depth of 2\" and fit pot with thermometer. Heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 350.Place cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Working in batches, remove tofu from marinade (do not scrape it off) and toss in cornstarch; shake off excess. Working in batches, fry tofu, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

"instructions": "Start by making the Coconut Caramel Sauce.In a medium saucepan with deep sides add the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Place the pot over medium heat and, swirling but never stirring, bring the mixture to a boil. Brush the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush if any sugar crystals cling to the edge of the pot.Allow the mixture to boil until it is a deep amber color and the sugar smells like dark caramel, about 6 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and, very carefully as it will bubble up, whisk in the coconut milk, heavy cream, and butter. Once the butter is melted let the caramel cool to room temperature. Left-overs can be stored in the refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to a month.For the topping combine the flour, sugar, and coconut in a small bowl and toss to combine. Add the cubed butter and, with your fingers, rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter is combined and the mixture has a crumbly texture. Cover and chill until ready to use.Heat the oven to 350 F and line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners, or place 12 paper baking molds on a baking sheet.In a medium bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to combine and set aside. In a separate bowl combine the coconut milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla and beat until well combined. Pour the went ingredients into the dry and stir until the dry ingredients are just moistened, about 10 strokes. Add the pineapple, coconut, and lime zest and fold to combine evenly, about 4 to 5 additional strokes.Divide the batter among the prepared baking cups. Top each with the crumble topping and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown and spring back when gently pressed in the center. For muffins baked in a muffin pan, cool in the pan for 3 minutes then transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool to room temperature. For muffins baked in paper molds cool to room temperature on the baking sheet.While the muffins cool prepare the glaze. In a small bowl combine the powdered sugar and the Coconut Caramel Sauce. Whisk until smooth. The mixture should be runny, but form a ribbon when drizzled into the bowl. If the mixture is too thick add coconut milk \u00bd teaspoon at a time until it thins out.Once the muffins have cooled drizzle them with the glaze. Allow the glaze to set for 1 hour before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pineapple-coconut-caramel-muffins-497243", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Colombian Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Arroz-con-Queso-y-Pimentn-(Green-Pepper-and-Cheese-Rice)-226570.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 226570, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Arroz con Queso y Piment\u00f3n (Green Pepper and Cheese Rice)", "creditText": "My Colombian Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tablespoon of butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup green bell pepper, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green bell pepper", "metaInformation": ["diced", "green"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-bell-pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11333, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups long-grain rice", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "long-grain rice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-long-grain-or-basmatii-cooked.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10220444, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup grated onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11282, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "3 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups of grated queso blanco or mozarrella cheese", "aisle": "?", "name": "mozarrella cheese", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 34.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/arroz-con-queso-y-pimenton-green-pepper-and-cheese-rice", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 71, "instructions": "Heat the oil and butter in a medium pot over medium heat.

Fold a long piece of heavy foil into a 13\" wide strip and fit it inside a 9\" x 13\" metal baking pan, leaving foil overhang on the 2 long sides. Spray the foil lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.Over medium-low heat, melt butter and chocolate together in a large heavy pan. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla and sugar.

At low speed, beat in the cream, vanilla, and cinnamon, then gradually beat in the melted (cooled) chocolate. Scrape down the side of the bowl and the paddle, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until light, 3 minutes longer. Using a wooden spoon, vigorously beat the buttercream for 30 seconds to deflate any air bubbles. Then spread buttercream evenly over the cooled brownie. Cut brownies right in the pan. Or...to achieve nice clean cuts, gently lift the brownies out of the pan, using the foil as handles. Cut off the outer edge for really clean cuts, leaving about an 8'' x 12'' rectangle of brownie remaining. Then cut into 2'' x 2'' pieces, wiping the knife clean after each cut.

Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and golden, about 15 minutes. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a nonstick 24-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.Meanwhile, unroll the pie crusts and use a 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out 24 rounds (12 rounds from each crust). Fit the rounds in the cups of the prepared muffin tin, pushing the bottoms down and pleating the sides slightly.Whisk the half-and-half, egg and egg yolk, cayenne and some salt and pepper together in a medium bowl until very well combined. Stir in the chives and transfer to a liquid measuring cup. Divide the onions and ham evenly among the 24 dough-lined muffin cups. Divide the half-and-half mixture evenly among the cups.Bake until the quiches are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Let the quiches cool in the muffin tin about 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

Toss in the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir well. Cook for 5 minutes, until they soften. Add in the other 2 tablespoons of butter and the mushrooms, stirring well. Cook for 5 to 6 more minutes, so the mushrooms soften. Stir in the garlic.Increase the heat to medium-high again. Pour in the chicken stock slowly while stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pot. Bring the stock to a boil and cook for 5 to 6 minutes.

Using a spoon, scoop centers from zucchini while leaving a 1/4-inch rim to create boats. Set aside.In a mixing bowl stir together ricotta cheese, egg and 1 1/2 Tbsp of the parsley. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Stir in 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese and the parmesan cheese. Set aside.Heat 2 tsp of the olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into pan, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up beef when stirring, until browned (there shouldn't be any excess fat but if you happened to use a fattier beef then just drain excess rendered fat). Stir in marinara sauce and 1 Tbsp of the basil, remove from heat.To assemble boats, brush both sides of of zucchini lightly with remaining 2 tsp olive oil and place in two baking pans (I used a 13 by 9 and a 9 by 9). Divide cheese mixture among zucchini spooning about 2 1/2 Tbsp into each, then spread cheese mixture into and even layer. Divide sauce among zucchini adding a few heaping spoonfuls to each. Cover baking dishes with foil and place in oven side by side and bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle tops with remaining 3/4 cup mozzarella, return to oven and bake until cheese has melted and zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle tops with with fresh basil and parsley and serve warm.*Look for zucchini that is wider and more uniform in width. The skinnier zucchini won't fit much filling.Recipe source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lasagna-zucchini-boats-667630", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/shortbread-cookies-293470.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 30, "id": 293470, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Shortbread Cookies", "preparationMinutes": 45, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 3.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "6 to 7 ounces very good semisweet chocolate, finely chopped", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "semisweet chocolate", "metaInformation": ["good", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 19903, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 cup sugar, plus extra for sprinkling", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": ["for sprinkling"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1145, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 18.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/shortbread-cookies-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "aggregateLikes": 112, "instructions": "Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together the butter and 1 cup of sugar until they are just combined. Add the vanilla. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.Roll the dough 1/2-inch thick and cut with a 3 by 1-inch finger-shaped cutter. Place the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet and sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown. Allow to cool to room temperature.When the cookies are cool, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Put 3 ounces of the chocolate in a glass bowl and microwave on high power for 30 seconds. (Don't trust your microwave timer; time it with your watch.) Stir with a wooden spoon. Continue to heat and stir in 30-second increments until the chocolate is just melted. Add the remaining chocolate and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring often, until it's completely smooth. Stir vigorously until the chocolate is smooth and slightly cooled; stirring makes it glossier.Drizzle 1/2 of each cookie with just enough chocolate to coat it.

                                   Start by cutting up the melons: Trim off the rind of all 3 melons, remove any seeds, and cut the flesh into 1/2 \u00adinch dice. Put all of the diced melon in a large mixing bowl.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a separate bowl, combine the ginger, sesame seeds, lime juice, soy sauce, 1/4cup of the olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Mix well and pour over the melon. Toss, and let marinate at room temperature while you prepare the rest of the salad.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Put the lentils and 4 cups cold water in a small saucepan set over high heat, and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and cook for 5 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain, rinse with cold water to chill, and then stir into the melon mixture.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Combine the coconut, peanuts, kaffir lime, remaining 1 teaspoon sugar, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saut\u00e9 pan.  Toast the peanut mixture over medium\u00adlow heat, stirring it constantly, until the coconut and peanuts have toasted, somewhat unevenly, to a golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Just before serving, add the peanut mixture to the melon mixture and stir gently to combine.
