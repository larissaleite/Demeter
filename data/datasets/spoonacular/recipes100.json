an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine 1/3 cup granulated sugar, salt and melted butter until well creamed.Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition and continue to cream.Pour the milk into a small bowl and add the packets of yeast.  Stir and let sit for 5 minutes until dissolved. Set aside.Add in the vanilla, orange zest and lemon zest to the mixing bowl and blend.Pour in the the milk and dissolved yeast and blend.Add the flour and mix on low until the dough tightens. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl, forms a ball and climbs slightly up the dough hook.Remove the dough from the bowl.  Coat the dough with the canola oil.  Return the dough to the bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.  Set in a warm, draft-free place, and let it rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.While the dough is resting, mix your colored sugars.  Place 1 cup of granulated sugar in a ziplock bag.  Add in 2-3 drops of food coloring.  Close the bag and shake and caress the sugar until it is completely colored.  Add more food coloring if necessary.  Repeat this process with each of the colors, using a separate ziplock bag for each.  Set aside to use later.After the dough has rested, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 10 minutes.Roll the dough out into an oblong piece.Brush the dough with canola oil covering the entire piece.In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon.  Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar liberally over the entire piece of dough.Once the dough is covered with the cinnamon sugar and oil, fold it in half lengthwise.Cut the dough into 3 long strips and lay the strips side-by-side.  Now it's time to braid the dough.(Braiding dough is just like braiding hair)Grab the center of the right strand and cross it over the middle strand, drop it in the center.  Grab your left strand and cross it over the middle strand.Repeat these steps until you have braided your dough to the very end.  Pinch the ends together and form a circle with the dough.Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet.Cover and allow the dough to rest again until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 370 degrees F.While the dough is resting again, make the filling.Cream together the cream cheese, powdered sugar and milk until smooth.Place the filling in a piping bag or scoop it into a large ziplock bag and cut off the corner tip of the bag.If you're inserting a pecan into the cake, push it deep into the dough between the braids.Pipe the filling directly on top of the dough.Place the king cake in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes until the dough is golden brown.Remove from the oven and make the glaze.Whisk together 1 cup of the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of the milk.  Drizzle the glaze over the top of the King Cake.Sprinkle the three colored sugars on top of the King Cake alternating the colors.Slice and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Pressing hard with a vegetable peeler, cut the carrot into paper-thin slices. Toss the carrot strips, vinegar, and salt in a small glass or stainless-steel bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours.Make the crab cakes2. Put the crabmeat in a large bowl. Mix the tomatillos, cilantro, scallion, celery, chile, and salt in a small bowl (this will mix them more efficiently than adding them separately to the crab) and add to the crab. Add the eggs and 1 cup of the panko and mix gently.3. Shape the crabmeat mixture into 6 cakes about 1 inch thick (use a 2\u00bd-inch entremets mold, if you wish). Gently coat the crab cakes on both sides with the remaining 1 cup panko.4. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers. In batches, add the crab cakes and cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 1 minute. Turn and brown the other side. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain, then place on a baking sheet. (The crab cakes can be prepared to this point up to 6 hours ahead, loosely covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated.)Make the avocado-tomatillo sauce5. Remove the husks from the tomatillos. Rinse, drain, and coarsely chop the tomatillos. Peel, pit, and coarsely chop the avocado.6. Put the tomatillos, avocado, cilantro leaves, water, and salt in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Pour into a bowl. (The salsa can be made up to 1 day ahead, covered and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.)Make the avocado-habanero sauce7. Put the avocado-tomatillo sauce in a small bowl and stir in the chile a little at a time until the sauce is as hot as you like. Cover and set aside at room temperature for up to 1 hour.8. Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Bake the crab cakes until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.To serve9. Spoon about 1/6 cup of the avocado-habanero sauce in the center of a dinner plate and top with a crab cake. Top with 3 marinated carrot slices, then some fried Beet and Onion Strings, if using. Squeeze droplets of Beet Juice around each crab cake. Repeat with the remaining ingredients on 5 more plates. Serve immediately.Wine Notes: To let the sweetness of the crab shine through while balancing the heat from the avocado-habanero sauce, an unoaked Riesling with pure and crisp fruit such as Grosset\u2019s Polish Hill Riesling from the Clare Valley in Australia is perfect (although just about any dry-style Riesling would be fine).", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Rest 5 minutes. Set mixer with paddle attachment and mix in remaining sugar (2 Tbsp + 2 1/2 tsp) milk, egg, butter, rosemary and salt on low speed (the butter won't blend until the flour is mixed it). Add 2 cups of flour and mix on low speed until combined, then switch to a hook attachment, set mixer on low speed and slowly add in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour. Allow mixture to knead on medium-low speed until smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed (you shouldn't need more than an additional 1/4 - 1/2 cup, dough should be slightly sticky. If too much flour is added rolls will be dense and heavy).Cover bowl with plastic wrap and rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile butter a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Punch dough down and divide into 12 equal portions, shape each into a ball (I like to pull the sides down and tuck under several times then make into a ball shape). Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place about 45 - 60 minutes until nearly doubled. Preheat oven to 350 during last 10 minutes of dough rising. Gently brush tops of rolls evenly with 1 Tbsp whisked egg. Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 23 - 26 minutes. Serve warm, reheat before serving as necessary.

a roasting pan. Mix the lime juice and orange juice in a measuring cup. Transfer 1/4 cup juice mixture to a food processor; add the garlic, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and pulse to make a paste. Rub over the pork and into the slits. Pour the remaining  3/4 cup juice over the pork; press the bay leaves on top. Cover and refrigerate 3 to 6 hours.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the pork skin-side up and roast until a thermometer inserted into the middle registers 160 degrees F, about 2 hours, 30 minutes. Cool completely before slicing. (Refrigerate leftover pork in an airtight container up to 1 week.)Make the sandwich: Cut the bread in half lengthwise. Layer the ham, 3 thin slices roast pork, the salami, cheese and pickles on the bottom half. Spread the mustard on the inside of the top half. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Butter the outside of the sandwich, then add to the pan and put a heavy skillet on top to weigh it down; cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side (or cook in a sandwich press). Cut in half on the diagonal.In any Cuban sandwich, mojo-marinated pork is key. Look for bottled marinade in Latin markets, or try this recipe from Tampa's legendary Columbia Restaurant.Photograph by Steve Giralt                                                    Recipe courtesy

Add the marshmallow mixture to the rice krispies and use a rubber spatula (and your muscles) to incorporate everything.  Once the mixture has cooled a bit, add the sprinkles and continue to mix.  Transfer mixture to prepared pan and use a spatula and your fingers to press into an even layer.  Spread Fluff (* see note below) over rice krispie treats until smooth and sprinkle more sprinkles on for decoration.  Transfer to the fridge for 20 minutes to allow mixture and Fluff to set before cutting.  Then use a sharp knife to cut small squares (I did 5x5).

You should end up with 12 rectangles.Take 6 of the rectangles and cut out a heart in the center, using the strawberries carved into hearts as a guide. Set  aside. On each of the 6 remaining rectangles, spread 1 heaping teaspoon of Nutella, leaving a 1/2 inch border around the edges. Then top the Nutella with a layer of strawberry jam, again making sure to leave a 1/2 inch border. Place a strawberry carved heart on top of the strawberry jam layer, in the center of the rectangle. Top with the pie dough with the heart carved out of the center. Seal the edges with the prongs of a fork and brush with egg wash mixture. Sprinkle heavily with coarse sugar. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack.

Taste and season again with salt and pepper.Trout1. Season the trout on both sides evenly with salt, pepper and fennel pollen.2. Bring the butter to medium heat in a large pan until it browns. Carefully place the trout in to the pan with the side that had the skin on up.  (It is important that the trout fillet is dry or use a non-stick pan so the trout does not stick.)  Sear the trout for about 1 minute and turn.  Sear for one more minute, add shallots and turn to low heat. (The cooking time could change depending how thick the fillet is. Ideally the trout is prepared to medium.)3.
