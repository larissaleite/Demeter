Stir together. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours (or as long as 48 hours), stirring once or twice to mix any sugar that settles at the bottom of the bowl. As the mixture sits, it will become more and moresyrup-y and liquid-y.Once the syrup is ready, stir the mixture once again, scraping the bottom of the bowl. Using a slotted spoon, remove the solid strawberry pieces, pressing them against the side of the bowl to release any additional juice--this mixture should yield roughly 2 cups of strawberry simple syrup. Don't worry if all the sugar has not dissolved.Whisk the vinegar (depending on taste preference, add between 1 and 1/2to 2 cups vinegar (I did two cups) into the strawberry syrup. Place the shrub syrup in a glassor plastic bottle (including any undissolved sugar), seal well, and shake. Store in the fridge for up to a month.Prepare Cocktail:Fill a tumbler glass halfway with ice cubes. Using a cocktail shaker, combine the gin and shrub and shake well.

(I used a fork to transfer from the wet bowl to the dry bowl so my hands didn't get as gunky). Repeat by dipping in milk mixture a second time and dredging again in flour. Place the finished onion rings on a plate until ready to fry.Once the oil is hot enough for the onion rings to sizzle, place the double battered onion rings in the hot oil and cook for 3-4 minutes or until exterior is crisp and light golden brown. I was able to fit 3-4 rings in my dutch oven at a time. Let onion rings cool on paper towels so soak up any excess oil.Whisk together all of the fry sauce ingredients until smooth, adding hot sauce to taste.

"aggregateLikes": 17, "instructions": "Set the oven or toaster oven to broil and preheat. Alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 500F. If youre using the oven broiler, position the rack 8 inches from the heat source. Core the tomato and cut a small X through the skin on the opposite end. Roast the tomato, cored side up, and tomatillos on a foil-lined pan, turning the tomatillos over once halfway through, until their tops and bottoms have blackened and they are a khaki-green color and cooked to the core, 20 to 30 minutes; and the tomato (without turning) until its top is blackened and its cooked to the core, 20 to 30 minutes total. Slip the skin off the tomato.Meanwhile, heat a comal, griddle, or heavy skillet over medium-low heat, and roast the onion and garlic on the comal, turning the garlic over occasionally, until it is just tender and golden brown with some blackened spots, 8 to 10 minutes; and carefully turning the onion slice over once, until its softened and charred on both sides, 15 to 20 minutes.Heat 1/2 cup of the oil in a medium heavy skillet over medium heat until it simmers. Fry the chiles, a few of the same variety at a time, turning them over with tongs, until puffed and slightly changed in color, 30 to 45 seconds per batch of mulato and ancho chiles, 45 seconds to 1 minute for pasilla chiles, and about 11/2 minutes for chipotle meco chiles. As the chiles are fried, transfer them to a large bowl. When all the chiles are fried, add enough cold water to cover them and let them soak for 30 minutes. Discard the remaining oil from frying the chiles and set the skillet aside.Using tongs, hold the tortilla directly over a burner set to medium, turning it over frequently, until its dark, golden brown, and some burned spots appear on both sides. Crumble it into the soaking fried chiles.Have ready a medium bowl and a metal sieve set over a small heatproof bowl.Heat the remaining 1/2 cup of oil in the reserved skillet over medium heat until it shimmers and fry the following ingredients one by one. As theyre fried, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the medium bowl (for ingredients that are difficult to scoop, empty the contents of the skillet into the sieve to drain first, then return the oil to the skillet and put the fried ingredient into the medium bowl).Fry the almonds, stirring, until they are golden, about 2 minutes.Fry the pumpkin seeds, stirring, until they are puffed and only slightly browned, about 1 minute.Fry the raisins, stirring, until they are puffed, about 1 minute.Fry the bread, turning over once, until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes.Fry the plantain slices, turning over once, until golden, about 3 minutes.Transfer the remaining oil (2 to 4 tablespoons) in the skillet to a 7- to 8-quart heavy pot and set aside.Wipe the skillet clean and heat it over medium heat until its hot. Toast 3 tablespoons of the reserved chile seeds (save the remainder for another use) in the skillet, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chile seeds to the medium bowl. Toast the sesame seeds, canela, cloves, aniseed, coriander, allspice, and peppercorns in the skillet, stirring, until the sesame seeds are a shade darker, about 11/2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the medium bowl.Drain the chiles and discard the soaking water, and puree them in the blender jar with about 2 cups of the stock.Heat the reserved oil in the pot over medium heat until hot, then add the chile puree and cook (use a splatter screen so the sauce doesnt make a mess of the stove), stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.Meanwhile, working in 2 batches, combine the fried and toasted ingredients (from the medium bowl) with the roasted tomato, tomatillos, onion, and garlic in the blender jar, along with 2 more cups of the stock per batch, and blend until smooth, about 3 minutes per batch. Be careful when youre blending hot ingredients: Cover the top with a towel, and hold the top firmly in place with your hand. Add the mixture to the chile puree in the pot as you blend it, and once youre done, swish a little liquid around in the blender and add it to the pot.Add the chocolate, sugar, and salt to the mole, stirring until the chocolate melts. Simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally and adding more stock as needed to maintain a velvety consistency that thickly coats a wooden spoon, but isnt gloppy, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with additional sugar and salt.At this point you would add cooked chicken or turkey to the mole, reduce the heat to low, and cook until its just heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/roberto-santibaez-on-how-to-make-mole-poblano-26559", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 360, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "BBC Good Food", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Crumbly-chicken---mixed-vegetable-pie-223191.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 223191, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Crumbly chicken & mixed vegetable pie", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "BBC Good Food", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "bay leaf", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "bay leaf", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bay-leaves.jpg", "unitLong": "leaf", "unitShort": "leaf", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2004, "unit": "leaf"}, {"originalString": "40g butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 40.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "100g button mushrooms", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "button mushrooms", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 11260, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 chicken stock cube or 400ml fresh chicken stock", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken stock cube", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bouillon-cube.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6080, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "250g cooked chicken", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "cooked chicken", "metaInformation": ["cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rotisserie-chicken.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 5112, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "1 egg, beaten or milk, for glazing", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["beaten", "for glazing"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "400ml milk, warmed", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "milliliters", "unitShort": "ml", "amount": 400.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "ml"}, {"originalString": "pinch mustard powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "mustard powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dry-mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002024, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "pinch nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2025, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "250g shortcrust pastry", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "shortcrust pastry", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dough.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 250.0, "id": 10018338, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "200g mix of sweetcorn, peas, chopped, peppers, broccoli, carrots or other veg", "aisle": "?", "name": "mix of sweetcorn", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 200.0, "unit": "g"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 61.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3429/crumbly-chicken-and-mixed-vegetable-pie", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "aggregateLikes": 185, "instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Peel and chop the onion as finely as possible. Melt the butter in the pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Finely slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan with the onions.When the onions and mushrooms are almost cooked, add the flour to the pan and stir to make a thick paste called a roux. Crumble the stock cube in and stir well. Continuously stir the roux over a low heat for 2 mins to cook out the flour. This stops the sauce from having a starchy taste.Slowly add the warm milk to the pan, stirring all the time. Once all the milk has been added, stir in the stock, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and mustard powder. Add the bay leaf and bring to the boil, stirring all the time to stop the sauce becoming lumpy.When the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Chop the cooked chicken into even-sized pieces and add to the sauce. Add your veg and pour into the pie dish.Put the pastry on a clean, floured surface. Make sure you also dust the rolling pin with flour. Roll out the pastry, trying not to make any tears. Measure the pastry against the pie dish and once the pastry is slightly larger than the top, lift it carefully over the dish. It might be helpful to use the rolling pin to help you move the pastry. Trim off the pastry hanging over the edge of the dish. Press the outside edge of the pastry with a fork or your fingers to make a nice pattern.Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg or milk. Make a small hole in the centre of the pastry top to allow the steam to escape. You can use any leftover pastry to decorate the top of the pie with pastry shapes if you like.

To prepare the risotto, chop the onion into small dice\u2014you want the onion to disappear into the risotto, so don\u2019t make the pieces too big. Place the egg yolks in a bowl. Grate the Parmesan. Zest the lemons and squeeze the juice. Reserve a few strips of lemon zest for the garnish. Pick the thyme leaves from their stalks, but leave a couple of sprigs whole for the garnish. Place your pan of stock onto the stove, bring to a boil, and then turn down to a simmer.2. Place the butter, oil, onion, and a pinch of salt in a wide pan over medium heat. Cook the onion very gently for about 4 to 5 minutes, until soft but not colored. It is really important with a risotto not to brown and burn your onion. This is a delicately flavored dish and the bitterness of burned onion will flavor the whole thing. (Keeping the onion in the center of the pan, rather than spreading it out, runs less risk of scorching. Placing it in a cold pan, without heating the oil first, also helps.)3. When the onion is soft, add the rice and stir very well to coat every grain. The pan will be getting quite hot and dry now, so add your white wine, sprinkling it in carefully around the pan\u2014this evenly distributes the wine and helps it to reduce and evaporate more quickly. Add half of the lemon juice and half of the zest and cook for 1 minute. Keep stirring gently. You will hear the wine \u201csinging\u201d as some of it reduces in the pan. This will probably take about 2 minutes, and then the rice will look dry again.4. Now you are ready to add your hot stock, a ladleful at a time. After every ladleful, stir well, really scraping the bottom of the pan, until the stock has almost disappeared into the rice. Then add another ladleful, keeping the rice moist all the time\u2014don\u2019t let it get dry in between ladlefuls. After about 15 minutes of adding stock and stirring in this way, start to taste\u2014be careful, since the rice will be very hot. The rice needs to be tender, but still have some bite to it. Your risotto should take no more than 20 to 25 minutes from start to finish.5. When you feel that it is almost there, take the pan off the heat.6. Quickly mix the cheese, as much thyme as you please, and the remaining lemon juice and zest into your bowl of egg yolks, and then beat this into your risotto as energetically as you can. The risotto should be nice and relaxed and creamy. If it feels a bit too thick, whisk in a little more hot stock. (Rice retains a lot of heat, so you can relax and not rush to finish it off.) It should be creamy and slightly soupy, so if you think it\u2019s too stodgy at the end, you can just add some more hot stock until you are happy with the consistency. Taste and season if you need to. However, remember that if you\u2019re using store-bought stock, it may be very salty anyway, as is the Parmesan, so you may not need much salt. 7. Spoon the risotto into wide bowls and garnish with the reserved lemon zest and thyme. [Editor's Note: Leftover risotto? One of our recipe testers forms the cold risotto into oblong little orbs of sorts, coats them in fine bread crumbs, and fries 'em up. Gotta say, we love that idea.

Line two 12-count muffin pans with 18 cupcake liners. Set aside.Make the cupcakes:Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a large bowl on medium speed until creamed. About 2-3 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the mashed bananas and vanilla, beating on low speed for about 1 minute.Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 additions, stirring by hand after each addition. Add the milk and stir until combined. The batter will be lumpy. Fold in the chocolate chips.Spoon the batter evenly into 18 cupcake liners. Fill the unused cups one-third full with water to prevent warping.Bake each batch for 17-19 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting.Makethe chocolate frosting:sift together the confectioners' sugar and cocoa powder to assure there are no lumps. Set aside.With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy - about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sifted sugar/cocoa powder alternately with the heavy cream and vanilla. Beat on low speed after each addition. Once all added, beat on high speed until creamy and combined for at least 2 minutes. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.Makethe peanut butter frosting:With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the peanut butter and butter on medium speed until creamy and completely smooth - about 3 minutes. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Mix on medium until combined. Add the cream and mix on high until creamy, at least 2 minutes. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.Frost cooled cupcakes with a knife or with a piping bag/tip. If you'd like to just make 1 kind of frosting and not both, make sure you double the frosting recipe of your choice to make sure there is enough for all cupcakes. To swirl the two frostings like I did,here is how I made the swirl frosting. There may be leftover frosting depending how much you use on each cupcake.

If it's not completely melted, zap it again in 15 second bursts.  Stir until smooth.Heat the milk, cornstarch, sugar and cocoa powder in a saucepan.  Whisk to combine everything as you heat.  When the milk starts to warm, add all the melted chocolate.  Keep whisking or stirring until the mixture thickens and just comes up to a bubble.  It will take somewhere around 12 minutes. Once it boils, take it off the heat and add the vanilla extract.  Set aside to cool slightly.Fill your popsicle molds with the fudge mixture and put it in the freezer.  Let freeze for 90 minutes, and then insert the sticks into the molds.  Continue to freeze until solid, 4-5 more hours.To make the Vanilla Bean Magic Shell, melt the white chips and the coconut oil, which will be in a solid form,  in a microwave safe bowl.  Start with 30 seconds and continue in short 15 second bursts, stirring in between, until it is JUST melted.  Stir to completely melt any lumps.  Be careful not to overheat white chocolate, it can be finicky.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the melted chocolate.  Stir to disperse them.Pour the magic shell into a container such as a wide mouthed mason jar.  Store at room temperature until you need it.  If it hardens, just give it a few seconds in the microwave and stir.  To remove the popsicles from the mold, fill your sink with hot water.  Immerse the mold up to, but not over, the top edge for 15 seconds.  If the pops don't slide out easily, immerse for a few more seconds.  Either dip the popsicles into the magic shell immediately, or put the pops in plastic baggies back in the freezer.  To coat the pops, just dip right into the white chocolate.  The coating will harden in seconds.  You can set the pops down on waxed paper,.  Once the coating is hard you can eat, or put the pops in baggies for the freezer.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/dutch-cocoa-popsicles-with-vanilla-bean-magic-shell-557403",

Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.Place the vegetables in the oven and roast at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. If you have two baking sheets on two different racks in the oven, youll need to switch them half way through to ensure even cooking.While the vegetables are roasting, cook the couscous. Bring 3 cups of broth up to a boil (or 3 cups of water + 1 Tbsp bouillion, in my case). Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour in 2 cups of couscous, turn off the heat, and cover the pot with a lid. Let sit, undisturbed, for at least five minutes.After the vegetables are finished roasting, transfer them to a cutting board and roughly chop. Collect the four garlic cloves and chop them well.

Keep refrigerated until ready to grill.                                                To make the sauce:                                        Pour the cream into a 1-quart saucepan and cook over low heat, whisking occasionally to prevent the cream from boiling over, until the volume is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Increase the heat to medium and add the butter, 1 piece at a time, whisking constantly, until the sauce is shiny, emulsified, and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the lemon juice and simmer briefly. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the chervil or parsley and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve. Set up the oysters on the grill with the cup side down (and flat side up) or place them directly on the grill in the same fashion. Cook the oysters without turning them. As soon as the oysters pop open, after 8 to 10 minutes, transfer them carefully with tongs to a platter (or plates) lined with a bed rock salt. If you are using a Great Grate, this won't be necessary. Use the tongs to pry off the top shells. Spoon 1 teaspoon sauce over each oyster and serve immediately.Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer                                                    Recipe courtesy of Jasper White

together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons of chile de arbol powder, or hot sauce, and a little bit of pepper, if desired. Add the chicken pieces, turn to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika, and 2 teaspoons chile de arbol powder (or cayenne) in a large bowl. Divide flour mixture among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a piece of waxed paper or on a clean platter while you heat the oil. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot.Yield: 4 to 6 servings                                                    Recipe courtesy of Bobby Flay                         CATEGORIES:

While waiting for the water to boil, start on the rest of the dish. Keep in mind that you want to reseve about 2/3 of a cup of water from the pasta.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil, then toss the chopped broccoli and asparagus in the skillet with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Toss well to coat, then cook until slightly golden and crisp, about 6-8 minutes. Using a large slotted spoon, remove the broccoli and asparagus, setting it aside in a bowl.Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add in the leeks and red pepper, stirring well to coat and cooking until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, then add spinach and kale with remaining salt and pepper, tossing well. Cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes or so. While the kale and spinach are cooking, add butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk constantly while it bubbles. The minute brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, remove from heat and whisk for an additional 30 seconds. (for more step by step photos of browning butter, click here) Let butter stand for 2 minutes, then add in minced garlic and whisk. Add in panko and stir well to coat and combine. Set aside.Slice avocado in half. Remove the flesh from one side, mashing until almost smooth. Add the 2/3 of reserved pasta water to the skillet with the spinach/kale mixture, stirring well. Add the mascarpone cheese and mashed avocado, continuing to stir until totally melted and creamy. Add in the cooked pasta, tossing well to coat. Finish by adding in the cheese, broccoli, asparagus and edamame. Taste and season additionally if desired.

Put the crab in a medium mixing bowl and set aside.    In a small bowl, whisk the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, Old Bay seasoning, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 tsp. salt.

Sprinkle the breadcrumbs and the parsley over the mixture, and mix them in thoroughly but gently; try not to turn the mixture into a mashit should still be somewhat loose. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.    Shape the crab mixture into 8 cakes about 1 inch thick. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. When the butter is frothy, add the cakes to the pan (8 should fit comfortably). Cook until dark golden brown on the underside, about 4 minutes. Flip the cakes, reduce the heat to medium low, and continue cooking until the other side is well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the cakes.

Make the Brownies: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving about a one-inch overhang on all sides. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.2. Whisk cocoa, espresso powder, and boiling water together in large bowl until smooth. Add unsweetened chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted. Whisk in melted butter and oil. (Mixture may look curdled.) Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla and continue to whisk until smooth and homogeneous. Whisk in sugar until fully incorporated. Add flour and salt and mix with rubber spatula until combined.3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and cool 1\u00bd hours.4. Make the Peanut Butter Filling: Beat together the peanut butter, butter and salt on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and alternate adding the powdered sugar and the milk, mixing to combine after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, beat to combine, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until completely smooth and creamy. If it seems a little bit too dry to spread, add another splash or two of milk to get it the right consistency (this could vary based on humidity levels). Using an offset spatula, spread the peanut butter mixture in an even layer over the top of the brownies.5. Make the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze: Melt together the chocolate chips and peanut butter in the microwave on 50% power, stirring every 30 seconds, until completely smooth and melted. Pour the mixture over the peanut butter layer and spread into an even layer with a spatula. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until set.6. Using foil overhang, carefully lift brownies from pan.

Allow to sit for at least 30 minutes so that excess moisture is drawn out. Alternatively, you can accomplish this by using a tofu press.Next preheat the oven to 400F and then line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Begin preparing the slaw by combining the cabbage with the vinegar and salt in a large bowl. Massage it with your hands for a few minutes then set it aside to marinate.Once the tofu has been pressed, dice it into 1-inch cubes and then transfer to the baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes on each side until its light golden brown. Then turn the oven off and set tofu aside to cool.Meanwhile mix together the spices (paprika to pepper) in a large bowl. Using your hands, lightly coat the tofu with one tablespoon of oil and then transfer it to the bowl with the spices. Coat each piece evenly then sprinkle the starch on top. Mix with your hands or a spoon until each piece is coated with the starch as well.Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium heat and then saute the tofu on for about 5 minutes on each side. Depending on the size of your skillet, you might have to do this part in two steps, using one tablespoon of oil at a time.Allow the tofu to sit in the skillet on warm then prepare the avocado crema by placing all of the ingredients in a food processor and blending until smooth.Warm the tortillas (I usually microwave them for 15-20 seconds) then place tofu inside. Top with cabbage and avocado cream and serve immediately.Tofu and cabbage can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. The avocado crema can be stored for up to 2 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/crispy-blackened-tofu-tacos-with-avocado-lime-crema-629239", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/marinated-lamb-kebabs-with-a-chile-yogurt-sauce-748812.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 8, "id": 748812, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Marinated Lamb Kebabs with a Chile-Yogurt Sauce", "preparationMinutes": 60, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tablespoon chili powder, toasted", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": ["toasted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2009, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cumin seeds", "metaInformation": ["toasted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2014, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh mint", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mint.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2064, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 cloves garlic, chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "2 cloves garlic, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "3 oranges, juiced", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "juice of orange", "metaInformation": ["juiced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9206, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "lamb", "metaInformation": ["cut into 1-inch cubes"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lamb-shanks.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.5, "id": 10017224, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 4053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 orange, zested", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "orange zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-orange.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9216, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 cup whole-milk yogurt", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "skim milk yogurt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1118, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 sweet onion, such as a Walla Walla, cubed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet onion", "metaInformation": [" such as a walla walla, cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11294, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 82.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/marinated-lamb-kebabs-with-a-chile-yogurt-sauce-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 23, "aggregateLikes": 36, "instructions": "Directions                                                        To prepare the kebabs, skewer the lamb pieces alternating with the onions into 6 large metal skewers. Place the kebabs in a large baking dish. In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, orange zest and juice, mint, and oil. Pour the marinade over the kebabs and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.While the lamb is marinating, prepare the yogurt sauce. Whisk together the yogurt, garlic, cumin, and chile powder in a bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until you are ready to serve.To grill the kebabs, oil the grill and prepare a hot fire. If you are using a gas grill, preheat on high. If you are using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are covered with gray ash. The fire is hot when you can hold your hand over the grill for no longer than 5 seconds. Remove the lamb from the marinade and drain very well. Place the skewers on the grill and grill, turning once or twice, for 6 to 8 minutes for medium doneness.Place the skewers on a serving platter, and garnish with mint sprigs. Serve warm, with the sauce on the side.
