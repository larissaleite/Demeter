Then in a separate bowl, add the baking soda to the matzo meal and mix together. Next, add the matzo meal mixture into the egg mixture while stirring to a loose consistency.

For the chicken stock: Place the chicken bones, garlic, celery, carrots, onions, parsley, salt, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves in a 10-quart or larger pressure cooker. Pour in about 16 cups water to just cover ingredients by 1 inch. Add more water if necessary but do not fill more than two-thirds of the pot. Cover and lock the lid. Bring to pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. (If the cooker has two levels of pressure, cook on the lowest.) Adjust the heat to maintain pressure, and cook for 45 minutes.Let the pressure subside by itself (natural method), or if in a rush, run cold water over the lid for a few minutes.Strain the liquid through a colander lined with layers of cheesecloth. Discard the solids.Cool uncovered and refrigerate overnight until the fat floats and solidifies. Remove the fat and save a small amount for matzo balls.Storage: Refrigerate up to 4 days. Important to bring to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute before using. Freeze up to 6 months.For the matzo balls:  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the seltzer, schmaltz, salt, pepper and eggs. Then in a separate bowl, add the baking soda to the matzo meal and mix together. Next, add the matzo meal mixture into the egg mixture while stirring to a loose consistency. It will look watery, like a loose porridge. If it becomes too thick, either don't add the full amount of matzo meal or add a bit more seltzer. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.Fill a large pot with water and salt and bring to a simmer. With wet hands, roll out balls and gently drop to the water. Simmer until tender, light and fluffy in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. (To test centers, insert a toothpick, which should slide easily all the way through.) Allow to cool in the water undisturbed. Refrigerate in the cooking liquid or transfer to chicken soup.Serve with assorted garnishes.

Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil and the berries start to break down and thicken slightly, about 4-5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder for the muffins. In another bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, brown sugar, eggs and milk until smooth and well combined. Add this to the flour and stir until just combined. Divide the muffin batter between the 12 cups in the prepared muffin tin. Use a spoon to make a well in the top of each muffin. Place 1 tablespoon of the cooled berry filling into each well.In a small bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, brown sugar and melted butter for the streusel topping. Using your hands, squeeze the mixture so that it forms clumps. Top the muffins with the streusel, dividing it equally between the 12 muffins. Lightly press it down into the muffin batter.Bake the muffins for 20-24 minutes, or until they are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let cool for 5-10 minutes in the muffin tin and then remove them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/peanut-butter-and-jelly-muffins-798069", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 39, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Hungry House Wife", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Tex-Mex-Chili-(-10-meal)-532810.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 532810, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Tex-Mex Chili ($10 meal)", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 210.08, "creditText": "The Hungry House Wife", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 can (15 oz) Hannaford Black Beans", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "beans", "metaInformation": ["black", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 15.0, "id": 16069, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 cup My Essentials Shredded Cheddar Cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cheddar cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1009, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon Chili Powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chili powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 box Jiffy Corn Bread Mix cooked to package directions with \u00bd of the thawed corn mixed in prior to baking.", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "corn bread mix", "metaInformation": ["mixed", "with \u00bd of the thawed corn  in prior to baking.", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornbread.jpg", "unitLong": "box", "unitShort": "box", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18022, "unit": "box"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup (4oz.)
