Free legs from tucked position, but do not cut the band of skin. Place turkey, breast side up, in roasting pan.                                             Heat oven to 325F.  Stuff turkey with stuffing mixture; turn wings back to hold neck skin in place. Cover breast loosely with foil to prevent overbrowning.                                              Bake 3 hours, basting occasionally with pan juices. Meanwhile, combine dressing and 3 Tbsp. each honey and lime juice.                                             Uncover turkey; continue baking 45 min. to 1 hour or until done (165F), brushing with dressing mixture for the last 15 min. Remove turkey from oven; let stand 15 min. before carving.  Meanwhile, remove excess fat from turkey drippings and pour into saucepan; add remaining lime juice and honey. Bring to boil, stirring frequently.

Working in 2 batches, heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. When the oil is hot, add half of the short ribs and brown on all sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the short ribs to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour the rendered short rib fat into a small bowl and set aside. Deglaze the saucepan with  cup of water and pour over the short ribs. Repeat with the remaining canola oil and short ribs.2. Wipe the saucepan clean and return to medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat. Add the onion, carrot, fennel and garlic cloves, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the spices and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Pour the vegetables into the baking dish with the ribs, add the orange zest and pour the remaining water over. Cover and cook in the preheated oven until the short ribs are tender, 2 to 3 hours.3. While the short ribs are cooking, make the caramelized onions: In a large, wide Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and rendered short rib fat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and transfer half of the caramelized onions to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt.4. Make the mujadara: To the remaining caramelized onions, add the lentils, 3 cups of the water, orange juice and zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, ground cardamom and allspice. Season with  teaspoon of salt, then raise the heat and bring to a boil. Cover, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the lentils are tender and most of the water has absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.5. When the lentils are ready, add the rice, black-eyed peas and remaining 1 cups of water. Cover and simmer until the rice is done, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes, before removing the lid and fluffing with a fork. Add the reserved caramelized onions, then taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Makes about 7 cups mujadara.6. To serve: Transfer the mujadara to a large serving platter. Slice the short ribs and place them on top of themujadara, along with some of the braising liquid.

Cut the half lime into four wedges and set aside. Finely grate the zest from the whole lime. Cut the zested lime in half and squeeze the juice from one half into a small bowl (save the other half for another use). In a medium bowl, combine 1 tsp. of the lime juice with the lime zest, mayonnaise, wasabi paste, ginger, and 1/4 tsp. salt. Stir to combine. Taste and add more wasabi paste if youd like a zippier flavor.    Run your finger along each salmon fillet to feel fortiny bones; use tweezers or needlenose pliers to pull out any that you find. Season the fillets lightly with salt and pepper. Spoon about 2 Tbs. of the mayonnaise mixture onto the salmon fillets and refrigerate the rest. With your hands, spread the mayonnaise in a thin layer over all sides of the fillets.    When the grill is ready, oil the grill grate using tongs and a paper towel dipped in oil. Grill the salmon until crisp and slightly charred on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue to grill until the salmon is just cooked through, another 3 to 6 minutes. Serve the salmon topped with a dollop of the mayonnaise and a lime wedge on the side. Pass the remaining mayonnaise at the table.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      with 1 tsp.
