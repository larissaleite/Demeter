Add the oil to a frying pan and heat over medium heat until the oil shimmers and is hot, but not smoking. Place two pieces of the chicken in the pan and fry undisturbed until you start seeing the edges start turning a tan color (about 2 minutes). Flip the chicken over then brown the other side. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate, then fry the other two cutlets. To make the sauce, drain out all but a tablespoon of oil, then add the minced scallions. Fry until soft and fragrant.

For the syrup: In a medium saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil until the syrup reduces to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the cream and cinnamon. Keep the syrup warm over low heat until ready to serve. (The syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Reheat before serving).For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Preheat a nonstick griddle or large nonstick saute pan over medium heat.Using a serrated knife, remove the top from the panettone. Cut the bottom of the panettone in half crosswise. Cut each half into 4 equal pieces. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, and sugar until smooth. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on the griddle. Working in batches, dip slices of panettone into the custard, turning to allow both sides to absorb the custard. Cook the soaked panettone slices until golden brown and firm to the touch, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and panettone slices.Transfer the French toast to plates. Drizzle the cinnamon syrup over the French toast and place a dollop of mascarpone on top. Lightly dust with powdered sugar and serve with fresh berries.Cook's Note: The top of the panettone can be reserved and used for toast.

About 10-15 minutes.Drain the potatoes and return to the saucepan. Add cream (or \u00bd and \u00bd), butter, salt and pepper. Cover with lid to let butter melt. Once butter has melted mash potatoes until smooth. Stir until combined. Add in beaten egg yolk and stir again until combined. Cover and set aside until ready to use.While potatoes are cooking, brown hamburger meat in large skillet or saut\u00e9 pan, drain, and remove from pan.Add the canola oil to the skillet/saute pan and heat over medium high until it shimmers. Add the onion, and carrots and saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes.Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.Next, add the browned beef, salt and pepper. Combine well and cook for about 3 minutes over medium.Sprinkle the meat mixture with flour and toss to coat. Cook for another minute.Stir in the tomato paste, chicken broth, worcestershire, rosemary, and thyme into the meat mixture. Combine well, cover and simmer for 10-12 minutes, until the sauce slightly thickens.Finally, add the corn and peas to the meat mixture, and mix together.Transfer beef mixture to an 11x7\" baking dish (or approximates). Smooth mashed potatoes across top, taking care to cover the whole top all the way to the edges. It helps to use a rubber spatula to create a seal. This prevents the mixture from bubbling out too much.Place baking dish on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake on the middle rack of 400\u00b0F oven for about 25 minutes, or until the potatoes just begin to brown.Cool a wee bit before serving.

Butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Butter the paper.

Set aside.                                   In another bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 2/3 cup of sugar and beat until the whites are firm and glossy.                                   Fold the chocolate into the egg yolk mixture until barely combined. Fold in the egg whites just until no white streaks remain.                                   Spoon 2 cups of the batter into a medium bowl and refrigeratethis will become your ooey-gooey topping.                                   Scrape the remaining batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cake is puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.                                   Cool the cake completely on a wire rack. Don't panic if the sides of your cake has pulled away from the pan and the center is a bit sunken. This is a crater into which you will pull the reserved batter, after all. At this point, you can cover the cake and refrigerate for up to 2 days.                                  Remove the belt/girdle of the completely cool springform pan and spread the reserved cake batter over the top of the cake (it will be thick, so be gentle), leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour.                                   Preheat the oven to 400 F. Bake the cake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until a thin crust forms on top and the batter is soft and creamy beneath the crust.                                  Let the cake cool for 10 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve warm.  To store, cover the cooled cake in plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

"aggregateLikes": 387, "instructions": "For the barbecue sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine the port, black cherry juice, figs and rosemary. In a separate medium saucepan, combine the vinegar, ketchup, honey, brown sugar, chili powder, salt, black pepper and cayenne. Bring each pan to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer both mixtures, stirring occasionally until each is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Remove the pans from the heat. Remove the figs and rosemary from the port mixture and discard. Pour the port mixture into the vinegar mixture. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Recipe yields 2 1/4 cups.  For grill preparation:  Build a charcoal fire for indirect cooking by situating the coals on only one side of the grill, leaving the other side empty. Preheat the grill to 250F.  For the seasoning paste:  Lightly chop the thyme, rosemary and oregano. Put the herbs into a small bowl and add the oil, soy sauce, salt, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder and ginger. Mix well until a paste forms.  For the lamb ribs:  Apply the paste evenly to each lamb slab. Put the lamb ribs over indirect heat, away from the coals, close the grill lid, and cook the ribs until they are dark brown and tender, about 3 hours 30 minutes. Remove the ribs from the grill and generously coat them with the barbecue sauce. Return the ribs to indirect heat, close the grill lid, and cook until the sauce caramelizes, about 10 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest for 5 minutes. Cut the ribs between the bones and serve.
