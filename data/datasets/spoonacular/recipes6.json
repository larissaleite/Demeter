Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil; then turn the heat down to low and gently simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, stirring occasionally and skimming any fat from the surface.Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook, uncovered, until the pork is tender, anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes more. To thicken the chili, in a bowl mix together the masa harina with 2 table spoons of the chili liquid. Stir this back into the pot, along with the remaining 1/2 cup cilantro and the lime juice. Cook until the chili has thickened, 10 more minutes. Serve with sour cream and shredded Monterey Jack cheese.                                                    Adapted with permission from The Homesick Texan's Family Table by Lisa Fain,  2014.

Pack prepared cucumbers into jars as tightly as you can without crushing them.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Pour the brine into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace (that's the amount of space between the surface of the brine and the rim of the jar).                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Remove any air bubbles from jars by gently tapping them. You can also use a wooden chopstick or plastic utensil to help remove stubborn bubbles.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Wipe rims and apply lids and bands (don't screw them on too tightly).                                                                                                                             8                                                                            If processing jars for shelf stability, lower jars into your processing pot. When water returns to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            When time is up, remove jars from canning pot and allow them to cool. When jars are cool enough to handle, check seals.                                                                                                                             10                                                                            If you choose not to process your jars, let them cool before putting them into the refrigerator. Do note that your jars may seal during the cooling process. However, without the boiling water bath process, that doesn't mean they're shelf stable. Still refrigerate.                                                                                                                             11

Rub all over the pork.Cover an oven tray with a large piece of foil. Place the pork on the foil. Take another large piece of foil. Cover the pork loosely and crimp the sides.

If you\u2019re happy with the tenderness, remove from the oven.While the pork roasts, mix together all the ingredients for the sauce.Take the pork out of the oven. Peel off the foil. Brush the sauce all over the pork, including the sides and bottom.Option 1: As soon as you take the pork out, turn up the oven temperature to the highest setting. If you have a \u201cbroil\u201d option, choose it.Transfer the pork to a rack, put it back in the oven and cook for five minutes. Take it out of the oven, brush it whatever remains of the sauce, out back in the oven and cook until nicely browned.Option 2: About 10 minutes before you expect the pork to be done, fire up the grill \u2014 as hot as it can go. Grill the slab of meat, turning it over once one side is browned.

Place a baking dish, roasting pan or dutch oven on a baking sheet. Open the can of beer and take a few sips and/or pour about 1/4 of it into the dish or pan. Set the can in the center of the dish. Remove the giblets and any other parts of the chicken and discard or set aside for another use. If desired, wash the chicken but either way - pat it TOTALLY dry with paper towels. You don't want one speck of liquid. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder. In another bowl, add the softened butter. Add a few pinches (about 1/3 of the mix) of the spice mix to the butter and stir together until combined and smooth. Gently lift the skin of the chicken and rub the butter all over the breasts (UNDER the skin) and the thighs, if you can get to them. You only have to add a thin layer because much of the butter will run out of the chicken as it cooks. Push it up underneath the skin as far as it can go. Slice one of the limes into 1/8-inch slices and slide them up underneath the skin - as many as you can fit in one layer. Gently sit the chicken on top of the can of beer which is in the dish (OMG, so many things), the beer can going into the cavity of the chicken. Or you might have one of those fancy contraptions that makes beer can chicken easier. Rub the outsides with olive oil - don't miss a spot! And rub the remaining spice rub over top.

Sprinkle the mold thoroughly with flour, then tap upside down over the sink to remove excess flour. (After my first batch, I forgot to flour the mold and merely buttered it, which turned out to be enough to prevent sticking.) Place the tray in the refrigerator for 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0C (450\u00b0F).Pour some of the batter into a piping bag fitted with a plain tip. (To make this step easier, you can place the piping bag in a tall measuring jug and fold the sides over and out to keep it open.)Pipe the batter into the prepared madeleine tray, filling each mold to three quarters. Bang the tray once on a cutting board (or your counter if it's sturdy) to remove any air bubble.Insert into the oven, lower the heat to 180\u00b0C (360\u00b0F), and bake for 12 minutes, until the sides of the madeleines are golden brown and the domes buttercup yellow.Remove from the oven and unmold immediately: holding the tray with both hands, tilt it forward so the madeleines face away from you, and bang the side of the tray on your cutting board or counter so the madeleines will pop out. Depending on how well-seasoned your tray is, it may take one to three bangs to pop them all out.Transfer to a rack to cool.

Add the chicken; cover and refrigerate to marinate for 4 to 6 hours.Prepare a charcoal fire using about 6 pounds of charcoal and burn until the coals are completely covered with a thin coating of light gray ash, 20 to 30 minutes. Spread the coals evenly over the grill bottom, position the grill rack above the coals and heat until medium hot (when you can hold your hand 5 inches above the grill surface for no longer than 3 or 4 seconds). Or, for a gas grill, turn on all burners to high, close the lid and heat until very hot, 10 to 15 minutes.For the basting liquid: Whisk together 1/2 cup water, the vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Set aside.Drain the chicken well and pat dry; sprinkle with pepper. Apply some oil to the grill grate. Place the chicken on the grill, leaving plenty of space between each piece. Grill until seared, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium or move the chicken to a cooler part of the grill. Continue to grill, turning occasionally and brushing with the basting liquid, until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the pieces from the grill as they cook and transfer to a warm platter. Serve immediately!

Transfer to serving dishes. Press the crust down a bit. In a stand mixer (or bowl with a hand mixer) combine the pudding mix and milk, whisk until well combined. Add the heavy cream, coconut extract,and flaked coconut, whisk again until light and fluffy. (you can do the two separate bowl routine but for this recipe it's not really necessary)Pour the filling into the serving dishes. In a stand mixer combine the heavy cream, granulated sugar, and coconut extract. Mix slowly at first (so you don't splash it all over) then gradually increase the speed to high. Mix until the whipped cream is thick. You can spoon it over top of the filling, or fill pastry bags and pipe it over top so it's a bit prettier. Toss the toasted coconut over top. If you don't have toasted coconut it's super easy to do. Lay a thin layer of coconut on a cookie sheet, preheat oven to about 300 degrees F, pop the coconut in there and cook (stir often) for about 5 to 8 minutes. I like mine dark so it's super nutty but you can toast yours for less time. It's all about personal preference. Pop these bad boys in the fridge to set up for about an hour, or even overnight.

and the salt and pepper until evenly combined. Pat the meat dry, then sprinkle with the flour mixture and toss to coat.Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven (or oven-ready saucepan) over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add half of the meat and sear until brown on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining meat.Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are brown, about 5 minutes.Heat oven to 325 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle.Add the garlic, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf and stir to coat. Stir in the wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Add the potatoes and stir to coat.Add the meat and any accumulated juices, and the beef broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the stew with a lid and transfer to oven. Cook until the beef is knife tender, about 1 1/2 hours.When beef is almost ready, make the biscuits. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, thyme, sugar, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined. Stir in the cream until a loose dough forms. Lightly flour a clean work surface, turn the dough out onto the surface, and knead briefly until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pat into a 1-inch thick circle and cut into 8 wedges.Increase the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the stew from the oven. Uncover the stew, and stir in the parsley. Top the stew with the biscuits and brush with a little cream. Return the pot to the oven bake until the tops are crispy and golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

into the oven, pour 3 tablespoons of the oil. Brown the meat in batches over high heat and remove with a slotted spoon to a plate nearby. You may need more oil as you do this. The onions will certainly need it, so pour the remaining oil or add more, add the onions, sprinkling a little salt over them and cook then until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, celery, thyme, and oregano. After a couple of minutes or so, when the smell of garlic wafts up, remove half the mixture. Add the meat to the mixture in the pan, cover with the remaining half, add the bay leaves, carrots, tomatoes, stock and wine. I use a big but flattish casserole and this amount of liquid covers the meat, but if you find you need more liquid, add water- you want a lot of liquid, because you will, eventually, be cooking some pasta in it. Bring to a boil, remove scum, and let bubble for about 3 minutes. Then cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or cook on a very low heat. The meat should be tender and yielding. Remove the carrots (and eat, cook's treat) and bay leaves, too, if you want, and season, to taste, with the salt and pepper.Of course you can proceed to the final stage now, but I am presuming you're not going to. In which case, let the stew cool and keep it in the refrigerator until you want it. Skim the fat off the top, and do remember to take it out of the refrigerator a good 1 to 2 hours before you cook it again. You can reheat this in the oven, but because the pasta will be put in on the stove, I tend to heat it there. Make sure the stew is piping hot. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. When it boils, add the salt and then pasta. Cook this until it's nearly but not quite cooked; it should have a couple of minutes still to go.Then drain the pasta and add it quickly to the bubbling juices in the casserole, making sure first that there are enough bubbling juices. You don't want the meat to be drowned, but you want enough for the pasta to be covered. The pasta will absorb some of the liquid as it finishes cooking, of course.In a couple of minutes, the pasta should be cooked. Crumble some feta and put in a bowl with the chopped parsley, oregano, or basil. Stir to combine and then leave the spoon with it, so that people can sprinkle the herb-spiked cheese over the stew as they wish. Ladle the stew into shallow soup bowls.

Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. This can be done 1 to 3 days in advance. It is best to make the sauce at least 1 day in advance to give the flavors time to blend.                                                                            Preheat a grill to about 375F for direct cooking.                                                                            Make the meatballs: Place the cumin, coriander, cardamom seeds, and star anise in a small skillet over medium heat and toast until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool, then grind in a spice or coffee grinder. Add the turmeric, seasoned salt, black pepper, cinnamon, and cayenne and mix well.                                                                            Place the ground lamb in a large bowl. Add the spices along with the onion, ginger, garlic, mint, feta, and spinach and mix well, but do not overmix as this will result in a tough texture. Form the mixture into meatballs 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.                                                                            Place the meatballs on the grill grate and cook for about 14 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160F on a meat thermometer, rotating the meatballs frequently to ensure that they caramelize evenly.                                                                            Serve with the dipping sauce.                                    Notes: You may substitute store-bought garam masala for the homemade spice mixture here.   You can have a butcher grind the meat, or you can do it yourself at home, using a meat grinder or food processor.
