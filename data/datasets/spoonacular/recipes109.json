Rub a 10 inch tube pan or 12-cup bundt pan with butter (or spritz with cooking spray) and dust with 1 tbsp. flour until the interior is covered. Tap lightly to shake loose extra flour.  Set aside.Spread pumpkin puree over two layers of paper towels and press two more layers on top.  Let sit for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, in a large mixer bowl cream butter until light.  Add both sugars in a steady stream and mix on medium for about 5 minutes.Add eggs, one at time, mixing well after each.

Place in a baking dish and season lightly on both sides with salt and pepper. Cover one side of the meat with half of the marinade. Flip over and cover the other side with the remaining marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Sear the meat on both sides, turning once, over medium-high heat. Then move the meat to indirect heat to avoid burning the marinade, and grill, turning once until rare to medium-rare. Transfer to a platter and let rest for 15 minutes.                                                                            Thinly slice the meat against the grain. Serve with lime wedges.                                    Cook's notes:Ancho chile paste is available in Mexican markets and specialty food stores, or you can make your own. Pour hot water over dried ancho chiles to cover, and let soak for 20 minutes, or until the chiles are softened. Drain and pure in a food processor to make a paste. Eight ounces of dried anchos will make about 2 cups of paste. Flank steak can also be cooked in the broiler, 3 to 4 inches from heat, 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.

Place a fine mesh sieve over the top of both bowls.In a saucepan, combine remaining cream, milk, sugar, and salt. Cook gently over medium heat, stirring regularly, until sugar is dissolved and mixture just starts to steam. Remove from heat.In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks. Slowly whisk in some of the warm cream mixture, 1/3 cup at a time, until about half of the cream mixture has been incorporated and yolk mixture is warm to the touch. You want to do this gradually; doing so will temper the egg yolks rather than cook them.Pour yolk mixture back into the saucepan and return to medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spatula, about 5 to 7 minutes, or until it reaches approximately 165 to 170\u00baF. Do not allow it to boil.Remove from heat, then add peanut butter and stir until smooth. Pour mixture through sieve into cold cream, discarding any solids. Add vanilla extract and stir until cool. Cover mixture with plastic wrap, carefully pressing wrap down onto the surface of the cream mixture. This will prevent a skin from forming on top of the custard. Refrigerate until completely cool, at least 3 hours or overnight if possible.Meanwhile, combine chocolate and peanut butter in a large, microwave safe bowl. Microwave on medium speed for 60 to 90 seconds, stirring every 15 seconds, until melted and smooth. Fold in rice cereal until evenly coated. Spread mixture in a thin layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then freeze until firm.

"instructions": "Mix dough: Grind rice in a blender or coffee mill (a food processor wont work) until mostly powdery but with some fine bits remaining. Transfer to a 6-quart (or larger) bowl. Thoroughly stir in 2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour, oats, wheat germ, 2 tablespoons each pepitas (or sunflower seeds), flaxseeds, poppy seeds and sesame seeds, the salt and yeast. Thoroughly whisk 2 1/2 cups ice water and honey in a medium bowl. Vigorously stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, scraping down the sides and mixing just until the dough is thoroughly blended. The dough should be moist and somewhat sticky, but fairly stiff. (The seeds will absorb moisture, stiffening the dough as it stands.) If the mixture is too dry, stir in just enough additional ice water to facilitate mixing, but dont overmoisten. If the dough is too wet, stir in just enough bread flour to stiffen slightly. Lightly coat the top with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.First rise: Let the dough rise at room temperature (about 70F) for 12 to 18 hours; if convenient, stir once partway through the rise. For convenience (and improved flavor), you may refrigerate the dough for 3 to 12 hours before starting the first rise.Second rise: Generously coat a 4- to 6-quart Dutch oven (or similar ovenproof pot) with oil. Coat the bottom and sides with 2 tablespoons whole-wheat flour. Vigorously stir the dough to deflate it. If it is soft, stir in just enough flour to yield a firm but moist dough (it should be fairly hard to stir). Transfer the dough to the pot.Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon whole-wheat flour over the dough; pat and smooth it in. Firmly tuck the sides underneath all the way around to form a round ball of dough; dust with more flour as needed. Brush the loaf with egg substitute (or egg white) and sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons pepitas (or sunflower seeds) and 1 tablespoon each flaxseeds, poppy seeds and sesame seeds over the top (it will be heavily coated). Using well-oiled kitchen shears or a serrated knife, cut two 1/2-inch-deep concentric circles in the top of the loaf, one about 2 1/2 inches out from the center, the other 3 1/2 inches out. Put the lid on the pot or tightly cover with foil.Let rise at warm room temperature until the dough is double the deflated size, 1 1/4 to 2 1/4 hours. (For an accelerated rise, see Tip.)20 minutes before baking: Position a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 475F.Bake, cool, slice: Reduce oven temperature to 450. Lightly spritz or sprinkle the loaf with water. Bake, covered, on the lower rack until the top is lightly browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Uncover and bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out with just a few crumbs on the tip (or until an instant-read thermometer registers 204-206), 15 to 25 minutes longer. Cool in the pot on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn the loaf out on the rack and let cool to at least warm before slicing.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/seeded-multigrain-boule-696835", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 1440, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Garnish with Lemon", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Maple-Apple-Upside-Down-Cake-611922.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 611922, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Maple Apple Upside Down Cake", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Garnish with Lemon", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00be teaspoon baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 18371, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup plus 1 Tablespoon buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1230, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1\u00bd cups all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup pure maple syrup", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19911, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00be teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Sweetened Whipped Cream for serving, optional", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sweetened whipped cream", "metaInformation": ["sweetened", "for serving, optional"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whipped-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1054, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 baking tart apples - peeled, cored and cut into 16ths", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tart apples", "metaInformation": ["cored", "peeled", "cut into 16ths"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grannysmith-apples.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1029003, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 9.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "\u00be tablespoon pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2050, "unit": "tablespoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 33.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.garnishwithlemon.com/maple-apple-upside-down-cake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 20, "aggregateLikes": 998, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350.

Place the zest, orange juice and all the other ingredients in a medium saucepan; Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn the heat down and continue cooking until most of the cranberries have popped, about 5  10 minutes. You dont really have to stir, but Im sure you wont be able to resist the urge to do that from time to time.Turn off the heat and let the sauce cool down a little then transfer to the fridge to chill completely, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. The sauce will be much thicker, and tastier, when cold.In a medium saucepan, add all the ingredients for the brine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes.Turn off the heat and cool to room temperature.Place turkey breast in brine (use a plastic, stainless steel or other non reactive container or you could also use a resealable plastic bag) and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.Remove turkey breast from brine and rinse well under cold water; pat dry. Slice your turkey breast open. To do that, place the blade of your knife parallel to your cutting board, put your hand flat on top of the breast and carefully slice down the middle almost all the way to the end. You want to stop about  of the way through. Place your now flat turkey breast on your cutting board and lay the apple slices so that they form a single layer but still overlap slightly. Don't go all the way to the edge; you want to leave about one inch all around. Spread cranberry sauce over apple slices and top with goat cheese. Close and tie your turkey breast with butcher's twine and leave it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Preheat your oven to 350F. Brush a non-stick pan with a little bit of olive oil and place to heat over medium-high heat. When pan is hot enough, sear the turkey breast on all sides and transfer to an oven safe dish; cover with aluminum foil. Roast in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until juices run clear. Take the turkey breast out of the oven and loosen the aluminum foil to form a tent.

On a plate fill with a generous spoonful of filling and roll up; place enchilada seam-side down in a baking dish and repeat until all ingredients are used up. Top with remaining sauce. Bake 30 minutes. To serve, top with sour cream and scallions.

oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3\u00bd. Line 2 x 12-hole muffin tins with muffin cases. Put the butter and caster sugar in a large bowl and blend with an electric hand whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Add the flour, almonds, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Mix again, then add the orange zest and juice, and almond extract. Give a final mix to combine everything. Use 2 dessertspoons to divide the mixture between the cases. Bake for 22-25 mins, changing the tins over after 15 mins. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 mins in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Can now be frozen for up to 3 months. To make the icing, tip the butter into a large bowl and blend with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Add the icing sugar, cream cheese, almond extract and orange juice. Mash everything together first with a spatula (to avoid a mess), then go in with the electric whisk and mix until smooth. Add your food colouring and mix again until you have an even colour. (If you\u2019re using liquid food colouring, it will make the icing runny, so add a little more icing sugar.) Fit the piping bag with a large curved  star point piping nozzle, then fill the  bag with half of the icing and twist  the end closed. To pipe, hold the  piping bag directly above the centre of  the cake and, applying a steady pressure,  pipe in a swirl, working out towards the  edge of the cupcake. When you reach  the edge, swipe the nozzle to create a  smooth finish \u2013 you can always cover  this bit with leaves, so don\u2019t worry too  much if it looks messy. When you have  piped 12 cupcakes, empty any remaining icing from the bag back into the bowl with the reserved icing. Add a little more colouring to create a deeper shade (and a little extra sifted icing sugar if the icing gets too runny). Whisk again, then refill your piping bag and ice the remaining cakes. Can be stored somewhere cool for up to 1 day (the fridge is fine, just make sure that you remove 30 mins before eating). Before serving, add a few leaves, if you like: pinch off small pieces of green sugar paste or fondant icing and shape into leaves. Use a sharp knife to add detail, then stick onto the cupcakes.
