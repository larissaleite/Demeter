Top the squares with their matching halves and then seal lightly with a fork.Poke a few holes in the top of each pop tart, brush with a bit of melted vegan butter, sprinkle with raw sugar (optional), and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.Let cool and then top with glaze if desired. To prepare glaze, simply whisk together melted vegan butter, powdered sugar and add juice 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. The glaze is not necessary, but recommended for sweeter pop tarts.Store leftovers in a covered container at room temp for up to a few days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Transfer to a serving bowl and set aside at room temperature.In a blender, puree the barbecue sauce, peppers, 1 teaspoon of the cumin and 1 teaspoon of the paprika. Put in a bowl large enough to hold the cooked wings and set aside.Heat about 3 inches canola oil in a deep pot until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees F.Combine the remaining 1 teaspoon cumin and paprika with the flour, and season with salt and pepper. Season the wings with salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour mixture. Fry in batches until golden brown and crispy, 10 to 13 minutes. Drain onto paper towels and toss in the sauce while still hot.Transfer the wings to a serving platter, sprinkle with the remaining 2 ounces Roquefort and serve with the blue cheese butter.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Test your oven with an oven thermometer to be sure it's accurate!Score the fat on the pork diagonally with a sharp knife in a crosshatch pattern. With a small paring knife, make a dozen 1/2-inch-deep cuts in the top and sides of the pork to allow the seasonings to permeate the meat.Place the garlic, onion, jalapeno, and oregano in a food processor and process until the ingredients are finely chopped. Add the cumin, chile powder, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper and process for 30 seconds to make a paste. Add the vinegar and olive oil and process to incorporate.
