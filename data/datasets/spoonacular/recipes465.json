Pour in 6 Tbsp melted butter and stir/ knead with spatula until butter is well incorporated and dough is uniform in texture and color. It should be very soft but won't stick to your hands.Transfer dough to a smooth cutting board. Separate your dough into two pieces, roll each piece into a long slim log and cut thin slices from each log. Don't cut them too big since they expand in the soup. You want them to be small and bite-sized. The dough should not stick to the knife or cutting board because of all the butter in it.After boiling potatoes about 10 minutes, keep the pot at a boil and add 2 bay leaves, diced chicken and prepared dumplings. Continue boiling over medium/low heat another 10 minutes or until dumplings are tender and chicken is cooked through.Season to taste - I added about  tsp more of salt.

Core and halve the tomatoes (leave the cherry tomatoes whole). Heat a flameproof roasting pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle with the 1/2 cup olive oil, then spread all of the tomatoes, the garlic and onions in the pan. Cook, stirring gently, until the garlic is browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the tomatoes are caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes.Remove the roasted tomatoes, garlic and onions from the oven and transfer to a large stockpot (set aside the cherry tomatoes for garnish). Add 3 cups chicken stock, the bay leaves and butter. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is reduced by one-third, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaves.Add the basil to the pot. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth (or puree in a regular blender and return to the pot).
