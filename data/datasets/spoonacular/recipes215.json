Lightly dredge both sides of the chicken in the flour, set aside.Heat the tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, place the chicken into the skillet and cook for 5 minutes; flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and place onto a plate loosely covered by a tin foil tent. Add a teaspoon of more olive oil to the skillet then add the onion. Cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes; add the minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly  for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice and chicken broth then bring to a boil. Boil the sauce for 2 minutes then reduce to low; season the sauce with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste, then add the chicken thighs and their juices back to the pan along with the capers. Cook for another 7-10 minutes. Serve the chicken with some sauce spooned over the top followed by a sprinkling of feta cheese and fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
