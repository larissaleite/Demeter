In a bowl, mix the hot red pepper sauce, margarine, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix pecans into the bowl, tossing to coat evenly. Spread pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring often and watching carefully, until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.                            Rub chicken with the olive oil, place on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with Greek seasoning. Bake 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Slice into strips.                            In a salad bowl, toss together romaine lettuce, chicken strips, cherry tomato halves, strawberries, grapes, raspberries, and blueberries. Sprinkle with pecans, and drizzle with dressing.

I like to put big spoonfuls evenly across cake and careful spread them to the edge and towards each other (that sounds weird, but it really helps not bring up the top layer of cake and have it get all mixed up in the cheesecake layer.)Once the cheesecake layer is evenly spread check the berry mixture to see if it has cooled off. Don\u2019t leave it in the fridge too long or it will set up. It doesn\u2019t have to be completely cool to add to the cake, you just don\u2019t want it to be hot or it will melt the cheesecake layerSpread the berry topping evenly over the cheesecake layer and put entire dessert in the fridge for at least two hours or overnight.Keep Refrigerated", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/raspberry-shortcake-dessert-582498", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 50, "servings": 24, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": ["asian", "indian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Indian-Chicken-Curry-with-Tomatoes-and-Onions-630151.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 630151, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Indian Chicken Curry with Tomatoes and Onions", "pricePerServing": 182.17, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Chicken 1 kg", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-chicken.jpg", "unitLong": "kg", "unitShort": "kg", "amount": 1.0, "id": 5006, "unit": "kg"}, {"originalString": "Red chilli powder 1 teaspoon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "chilli powder", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2009, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Coriander powder 1 1/2 teaspoon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "coriander powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2012, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Chopped coriander leaves to garnish.", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh coriander leaves", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "leave", "unitShort": "leaves", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "leaves"}, {"originalString": "Garam Masala powder 1/2 teaspoon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garam masala", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garam-masala.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93663, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Garlic chopped 4 cloves", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "Fresh Ginger Chopped square pieces 1/4 - in (5 mm)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped", "(5 mm)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "square", "unitShort": "square", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "square"}, {"originalString": "Green Chili 2 deseeded and chopped finely", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "green chili", "metaInformation": ["green", "deseeded", "chopped", "finely"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-peppers-green.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 31015, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "OIl 4 tablespoon", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "Large Onions very finely chopped 5", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onions", "metaInformation": ["large", "very finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Salt to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Chopped tomatoes 5", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11529, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 78.0, "sourceUrl": "http://swatisani.net/kitchen/recipe/simple-indian-chicken-curry/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 13, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Make cuts in the flesh of chicken for masala to seep in if you are using chicken in bone.
