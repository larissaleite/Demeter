Lightly cover with plastic wrap, then cook for 10 minutes on high power, or until fork tender. Alternatively, you can of course roast the beets in an oven safe dish tighly covered wtih aluminum foil in a425Ffor 45-60 minutes. However, the microwave is perfect for when you are in a rush.While the beets cook, make the dressing. In the jar of a blender, place 6 oz of the blackberries along with the balsamic vinegar, honey and salt and blend. With the blender running on low speed, drizzle in the olive oil and blend until it just becomes emulsified, this will take under a minute. Pass the dressing through a sieve to remove the seeds and set aside. You could make the dressing a day in advance, if you wish, keeping it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.When the beets are tender, remove from the microwave and let it cool before handling. Peel the beets and cut into segments.Assemble the salad by dividing the greens between four bowls.
