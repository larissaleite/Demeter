In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.                        Roll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).                        Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/clone-of-a-cinnabon-719955", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,

In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk together pumpkin puree, sugars, vegetable oil and eggs. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula just until moist. Scoop the batter evenly into the muffin tray. Place into oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack before frosting. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and cream cheese on medium speed until light and fluffy, approximately 2-3 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add confectioners' sugar, beating just until incorporated. Add vanilla and cinnamon until well combined. Increase speed to medium high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, approximately 1-2 minutes. Use a small offset spatula or a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip to frost cupcakes, garnished with pumpkins candy, if desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
