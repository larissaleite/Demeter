Let the mixture sit until the bread begins to absorb custard, about 30 minutes, tossing occasionally.3. Pour the bread mixture into the prepared baking dish. Cover the dish with foil, and bake for 45 minutes.4. Meanwhile, mix the granulated sugar and remaining \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Using your fingers, pinch the butter into the sugar mixture until the crumbs are the size of small peas. Remove the foil from pudding, sprinkle with the butter mixture, and bake, uncovered, until the custard is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and bake until the top of the pudding forms a golden crust, about 2 minutes. Let the pudding cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours). 5. Make the Icing: Whisk together the powdered sugar, heavy cream and vanilla until smooth. If necessary, add a teaspoon of powdered sugar or heavy cream at a time to achieve a drizzling consistency.

In a large bowl, whisk together egg, oil, milk, zest and juice of 1 clementine and vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking until just combined. Evenly divide the batter, about 1/4 cup batter per muffing tin. Bake for 14-16 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool on rack for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto rack to cool completely.For the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the confectioners sugar with clementine juice. You want the glaze to be thick enough to thickly coat the back of a metal spoon. Add more sugar or juice as needed to reach the desired consistency. For the sugared zest: In a small bowl, combine clementine zest and sugar with your fingers, until zest is evenly distributed. When muffins are cooled completely, dip the tops in the glaze and immediately sprinkle with sugared zest. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Tip: When grating a fruit for zest, be sure to just grate the colored outside layer of the fruit. Do not grate the white layer, the pith, that is under the colored skin.

her family. I always love going to Lake Tahoe because Kate and her family are the nicest people, and we always end up doing something fun in the beautiful Tahoe scenery. Last summer we went horseback riding and drove around the lake on a boat, and this past winter we all went skiing in the enourmous and fluffy mounds of snow. This year I don't know what out activities will entail exactly, but I know it will be fun and relaxing and that my friend Sarah will probably make bananas foster like she does on every trip, which is really all any of us needs. But before I headed out on the road, I decided to make a Fourth of July-related recipe to post before I leave, and here it is! I've always liked blueberry pies, (like is an understatement), but have never tried to make one myself until now. Since I am kind of obsessed with blueberries, I decided to make it in a springform cake pan so that I could make it ridiculously deep and fit as many blueberries as humanly possible. I also baked it with a buttermilk custard, which went quite well with the berries. I love cutting fun patterns into the tops of pies, and since it is near the anniversary of the founding of our great nation, I used star cookie cutters to create a nice \"spangled banner\" design on the top crust. It doesn't really look like the flag, but there are stars on it so it's kinda close. The pie came out looking really lovely, I think I will make all of my pies in cake pans from now on so I can really pack in the filling. I hope you all have a lovely Fourth with your friends and families and eat a ton of good food.

You may have to stop from time to time so that the gluten can relax. At these times, lift the dough from the counter and wave it a little, and then lay it back down. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while it relaxes. When it is the desired thinness, let the dough relax for 5 minutes. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Carefully lift the sheet of dough and lay it on the parchment. If it overlaps the edge of the pan, snip off the excess with scissors.5. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Mist the top of the dough with water and sprinkle a covering of seeds or spices on the dough (such as alternating rows of poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, kosher or pretzel salt, etc.).

In mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt, yeast, honey, oil, and just enough water to bring everything together into a ball. You may not need the full \u00bd cup water, but be prepared to use it all if needed.2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for about 10 minutes, or until the ingredients are evenly distributed. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77\u00b0 to 81\u00b0F. The dough should be firmer than French bread dough, but not quite as firm as bagel dough, satiny to the touch, not tacky, and supple enough to stretch when pulled. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough tot he bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.3. Ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (You can also instead retard the dough overnight in the refrigerator immediately after kneading.)4. Mist the counter lightly with spray oil and transfer the dough to the counter. Press the dough into a square with your hand and dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Roll it out with a rolling pin into a paper-thin sheet about 15 inches by 12 inches. You may have to stop from time to time so that the gluten can relax. At these times, lift the dough from the counter and wave it a little, and then lay it back down. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while it relaxes. When it is the desired thinness, let the dough relax for 5 minutes. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Carefully lift the sheet of dough and lay it on the parchment. If it overlaps the edge of the pan, snip off the excess with scissors.5. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Mist the top of the dough with water and sprinkle a covering of seeds or spices on the dough (such as alternating rows of poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, kosher or pretzel salt, etc.).

Whisk to combine. Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in fine meshed strainer and break them up with your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on top. Allow the excess water to blot out for at least 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip to coat. Lift it and gently pat off the excess flour. Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred).

Dump the flour and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse briefly to combine. Sprinkle with the butter and process until the mixture is crumbly. Add just enough water through the feed tube to make the dough come together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days in advance. (Remove the tart dough from the refrigerator and let it come to slightly cooler than room temperature before rolling it out.)2. Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle, again on a lightly floured surface. Carefully wrap the dough around the rolling pin and drape it over an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Gently press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Trim the overhanging dough to about 1/2 inch, fold it in over the side of the pan, and press it to reinforce the side of the tart. Use the rolling pin or the flat of your hand to press around the perimeter of the pan to cut off any excess dough. Place the tart pan in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.3. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).4. Remove the tart pan from the refrigerator and line it with a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil (or 2 pieces of regular aluminum foil to create a double thickness). Fill the lined shell with pie weights or dried beans and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and the beans and bake for 10 to 15 more minutes, until the crust is light golden. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).Make the tart filling5. Select half of the carrots\u2014choose the least attractive ones\u2014and slice them into thick coins. Reserve the remaining carrots for the spiral surface of the tart. Place the cut carrots in a large saucepan with the onion and just enough broth to cover (you should have some broth left). Bring the broth to a simmer over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and gently cook the carrots for 30 minutes. Uncover and cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until the carrots are very tender and almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Let cool for 10 minutes.6. Transfer the cooked carrots and any liquid remaining in the pan to a blender and puree until smooth, adding an extra splash of broth if necessary to loosen the mixture just enough to puree it. Transfer the puree to a skillet or saute pan placed over medium-low heat. Cook briefly, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon or spatula, until the puree is thick and any liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of butter. Whisk in the egg yolks and Parmigiano cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper.7. Cut the reserved carrots into thin, uniform coins. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet or wide saute pan over medium-low heat. When the butter has melted, add the carrots and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook the carrots over medium-low to low heat for about 30 minutes, or until they\u2019re just tender, moistening them from time to time with a splash of broth to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and let the carrots sit until cool enough to touch.Assemble the tart8. Spread the carrot puree over the baked tart crust.

Gently brush the top of the tart with any liquid remaining in the pan in which the carrot coins were saut\u00e9ed and then dot the surface of the tart with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, cut into small pieces.9. Bake the tart for about 20 minutes, until the filling is heated through and the top is very lightly browned. Transfer the tart pan to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.
