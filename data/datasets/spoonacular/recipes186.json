Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to a few days. (If the dough has been in the fridge overnight or longer, let it come to room temperature for 30 minutes prior to rolling, as it needs to have a bit of give. If it has been refrigerated for only a couple of hours, you can roll it out immediately.)4. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12 1/2-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer it to a 9-inch pie dish, preferably deep-dish, by either folding the dough into quarters and unfolding it in the dish or rolling the dough around a rolling pin and unrolling it into the dish. Tuck the excess dough under the edges to create a double thickness and a smooth edge. Then pinch the dough every 2-inches to form a decorative border. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling and crumb topping.Make the filling5. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C) and position a rack in the center of the oven.6. In a medium bowl, combine the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, flour, and cinnamon and toss gently but thoroughly to combine.Make the crumb topping7. In another medium bowl, combine the flour, butter, sugars, ginger, and salt. Using a pastry blender or two table knives, cut the mixture until the biggest pieces of butter are something like the size of small peas. The crumb topping will still seem very dry and floury looking. That\u2019s okay.Assemble the pie8. Spoon the filling into the pie crust, then top with the crumb mixture. Place the pie on a large rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper and bake until the crust is dark golden brown, the filling is bubbling, and some juices are spilling over the edge, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack, if you can stand the wait, before slicing and serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/strawberry-rhubarb-pie-with-ginger-crumb-topping-598256", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 180, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Goodeness Gracious ", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Easy-BBQ-Chicken-Sandwiches-519532.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 180, "id": 519532, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Easy BBQ Chicken Sandwiches", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 112.63, "creditText": "Goodeness Gracious ", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 cup BBQ Sauce", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "bbq sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barbecue-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6150, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Garnish: Additional BBQ Sauce & Ranch Dressing", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "bbq sauce", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barbecue-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 6150, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "8 Buns", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "buns", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 18064, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Seasoned Salt to Taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "seasoned salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1042047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "8 Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken thighs", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-thighs.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 8.0, "id": 5096, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 65.0, "sourceUrl": "http://goodenessgracious.com/2013/08/easy-bbq-chicken-sandwiches.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg", "id": 404718, "name": "slow cooker"}], "step": "Place chicken in your slow cooker", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Sprinkle liberally with seasoned salt", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "id": 1042047, "name": "seasoned salt"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Pour BBQ Sauce on top", "number": 3, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barbecue-sauce.jpg", "id": 6150, "name": "barbecue sauce"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Cook on High for 3-4 Hours or Low for 5-6.Shred each thigh and place on a bun, drizzling with BBQ Sauce and Ranch.", "number": 4, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barbecue-sauce.jpg", "id": 6150, "name": "barbecue sauce"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-bread.jpg", "id": 18064, "name": "roll"}]}], "name": ""}], "aggregateLikes": 2602, "instructions": "Place chicken in your slow cookerSprinkle liberally with seasoned saltPour BBQ Sauce on topCook on High for 3-4 Hours or Low for 5-6.Shred each thigh and place on a bun, drizzling with BBQ Sauce and Ranch.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/easy-bbq-chicken-sandwiches-519532", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 185, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/celery_soup_recipe_with_fennel-12234.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 12234, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Celery Soup Recipe With Fennel", "pricePerServing": 45.9, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "5 Stalks celery -

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For the sauce: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl or container and refrigerate until ready to use.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 To bake the pizza: One hour before baking pizza, adjust oven rack to second highest position (rack should be about 4 to 5 inches below broiler), set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half. Shape each half into smooth, tight ball. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray; let stand for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Coat 1 ball of dough generously with flour and place on well-floured countertop. Using fingertips, gently flatten into 8-inch disk, leaving 1 inch of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12-inch round, working along edges and giving disk quarter turns as you stretch. Transfer dough to well-floured peel and stretch into 13-inch round. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Slide pizza carefully onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through. Remove pizza and place on wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
