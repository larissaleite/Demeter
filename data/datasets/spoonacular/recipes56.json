If desired, add about 3-5 drops of red food coloring.Divide the batter between the two cake pans and bake 25-30 minutes or until the tops are brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes then invert cakes onto cooling racks. Cool completely.In a large mixing bowl, beat together the cream cheese and butter until smooth.

Slide pieces of parchment or wax paper underneath the cake for easy clean up later. Spread some of the frosting on top of the cake. Top with the remaining cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting all over the cake, sealing in the crumbs (don't use more than half of the frosting). Refrigerate 15 minutes.Finish covering the cake with the remaining frosting.

First, make the baklava syrup. Combine the water, sugar, honey, cinnamon stick and orange peel in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.    2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    3. Place the walnuts, cinnamon and cloves in a food processor and process until the walnuts are finely ground.    4. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over very low heat, keeping it warm throughout the process so it doesn't start to solidify.    5. Brush a 9\u00d713-inch pan with melted butter and place one layer of phyllo at the bottom. Brush the phyllo with the melted butter, and then add another layer of phyllo, and brush with more butter. Continue this process until you have layered 7 sheets of phyllo.    6. Gently spread one-quarter of the nut mixture evenly over the top of the phyllo. Repeat the process of layering phyllo sheets and brushing with melted butter, but this time use only 5 sheets of phyllo. Gently spread another one-quarter of the nut mixture over the top of the phyllo. Repeat this twice more, layering and buttering 5 sheets of phyllo and topping with one-quarter of the nut mixture. Finish off with 7 layers of buttered phyllo. Brush the top sheet with melted butter, as well.    7. Using a sharp knife, trim any ragged pieces of phyllo dough that has crept up the sides of the pan. Cut the baklava into 12 even squares, and then cut into triangles (you should have 24 triangles). Place the pan in the oven and bake for about 50 minutes, or until golden brown.    8. As soon as the baklava comes out of the oven, remove the cinnamon stick and orange peel from the syrup and slowly pour it over the hot baklava, making sure to get it into all of the cracks and crevices, as well as on the top surface. Allow the baklava to sit for at least 4 hours before serving so the syrup has a chance to soak in. (The baklava is actually best when left to sit overnight before serving.)

When you are baking pasta in the oven you want to give yourself some cooking leeway, otherwise they will end up a mushy mess. A tasty one, but texture wise it won\u2019t be that appetizing. Once the shells are cooked, drain the water and place the pasta into the baking dish.Chop your bacon up into small pieces and fry up quickly to your desired texture. I prefer my bacon about half-cooked when it\u2019s going into another dish, nothing is worse than chewy raw-hide textured bacon in a smooth, creamy pasta dish. I cook it until most of the fat is gone but it\u2019s still soft. Once that is done, drain the fat and set it aside.Take your chanterelle mushrooms, chop them up coarsely and fry them in a small amount of butter over medium-low heat in a frying pan until most of their water content has been shed. Set aside.Time to make your cheese sauce, which is the base of any white sauce out there, your basic roux. Start with your butter in a pot, and heat it till its melted. Mix in the flour until it\u2019s a gluey mixture. Doesn\u2019t that sound yummy!The secret to a white sauce is patience. Star by adding in a tiny amount of the milk. Mix it in thoroughly. Add in the rest of the milk, little by little, stirring to avoid lumps from forming. Once you have the milk all added, with no flour lumps we hope, add in the cream.Heat the mixture, stirring to avoid scorching the milk and add in your cheese. Let the mixture thicken up and the cheese melt. Add in your salt and pepper.Toss the bacon and chanterelles into the cheese sauce, combine then pour over the pasta shells in your baking dish. Stir to cover the pasta completely then place the lid on top.Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, until the pasta is heated all the way through and the cheese sauce baked.Garnish with your freshly

Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Whisk in melted butter. Batter should be pretty runny. Let batter sit while you prep the filling.2) Slice mushrooms, dice peppers, onions, and garlic. Add mushrooms to a large skillet with a drizzle of olive oil and saute over medium-high heat until the mushrooms release their liquid and soften, about 5-6 minutes.3) Add other filling ingredients (except cheese) to the skillet and cook for another 4-5 minutes until peppers soften. Season filling with salt and pepper, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of dried thyme. Set filling aside.4) Preheat oven to 400 degrees.5) Using a large nonstick skillet, or crepe pan, add a small amount of butter over medium-high heat. Pour in about 1/2 cup of crepe batter and swirl it around the pan so it flattens out. Cook for 30-45 seconds on the first side until it firms up, then carefully flip the crepe and cook for another 15-20 seconds. Repeat until you have 4 large crepes. The batter will make 5-6 crepes so you can mess up one without worry.6) Butter a pie pan and lay a crepe in the bottom of the pan. Add half of the mushroom filling and 1/3 of the grated cheese.7) Top with a second crepe and 1/3 of the cheese.8) Top with a third crepe. So the middle layer is just cheese basically.9) Add rest of filling and cheese to top of the pie and top with the fourth crepe. Kind of crimp the edges of the crepe around the edges of the pie so it is mostly sealed.10) Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.11) Let cool briefly and then slice and serve!", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

                                                            Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Begin whipping the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on low speed. As the whites start to look wet and frothy, after about 45 seconds, add cream of tartar and salt and allow it to dissolve with the mixer still on low speed, about 10 seconds.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While the whites are still frothy, slowly begin to add the sugar in a steady stream with the mixer on low. Once you've added about 1/4 cup of the sugar, increase the speed to medium and continue to gradually add the sugar as the mixer runs.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whisk until the meringue is thick and glossy and holds firm peaks when you lift the whisk out of it, about 4 minutes. If it's not there yet, continue to whip the meringue on high speed at 30 second intervals and test again.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once the meringue is at firm peak stage, spoon a tiny dot of it onto each of the four corners of a baking sheet and press the parchment paper liner down over it. This will anchor the parchment paper.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Carefully fold the chocolate into the meringue with a rubber spatula, taking care not to deflate it.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Spoon 1 1/2 inch to 2 inch dollops of the meringue mixture onto the baking sheet, spaced one inch apart. Try to shape the meringues with a spoon so they have crags and ridges all over.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bake until the meringues harden on the outside, develop cracks and are only slightly moist on the inside, about 2 hours (this can vary widely depending on your oven). To test for doneness, remove one meringue, allow to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes, then break open to check texture. The center should only be slightly moist at this point.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Allow the meringues to cool on a wire rack. Allow them to cool for at least 1 hour (see note) in a dry place before storing them in a container with the lid left only partially on.

Line the outside of a 9\" springform pan with tinfoil. Melt the 16 oz. over a double boiler. Stir until smooth, remove from heat and let the chocolate cool slightly. Beat the eggs and dark brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer at medium/high speed for about 10 minutes, or until pale and thickened(more like lightly whipped cream). Fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture until combined. Mix the 10 oz. cream and vanilla together and pour into the chocolate egg mixture. Fold in until just combined and pour into the prepared springform pan. Place the springform into a larger pan and place in the oven. With the oven rack slid out, pour boiling water into the larger pan around the torte until it comes 1/2 way up the sides of the torte pan. Carefully slide the rack back in the oven and allow the torte to bake for 60-70 minutes, or until set. When finished baking, remove the torte from the water bath and allow to cool in the fridge, covered, until firm. This will take at least 2 hours(use the freezer to speed up the cooling process, but don't allow to freeze!)TO MAKE THE TRUFFLES: Place the 125 g. dark chocolate chips in a bowl along with half of the 1/3 C. heavy cream. Microwave for 45 seconds. Remove the bowl from the microwave and whisk the chocolate and cream together until smooth. Add in the remaining cream and whisk until combined. Refrigerate while making the caramel mousse.FOR THE CARAMEL MOUSSE: Place 1 1/2 C. sugar into a medium saucepan. Pour the 1 C. water on top of the sugar and stir just to wet all of the sugar. Place the pan on medium/high heat. As the sugar water begins to boil, brush down the sides of the pan with a basting brush dipped in water to prevent sugar crystals from forming.As the sugar starts to boil, do not stir. Meanwhile, place the 3/4 C. heavy cream in the microwave for about 45 seconds, taking care not to let it boil over. place near your boiling sugar, along with the 2 T. butter. After about 7-10 minutes the sugar will begin to caramelize and turn golden brown. Swirl the pan around to encourage thorough caramelization, but do not stir.When your caramel is a deep golden brown, remove it from the heat. I recommend using oven mitts for the next step. Place the butter in the pan and whisk furiously to incorporate the butter(the caramel will bubble and splatter, so take care). When the butter is incorporated, add the heavy cream and quickly whisk it in to the caramel.Allow the caramel to cool for about 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, place the 3 T. Water in a small bowl. Sprinkle the package of gelatin over the water and allow it to soak for 5 minutes.While the gelatin is soaking, place the 2 1/4 C. of heavy cream in a mixing bowl and beat with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside.Add 1/4 C. of the caramel to the bowl of gelatin and microwave for about 10 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted(this happens quickly so watch closely!)Mix the gelatin and caramel together well. Pour the mixture into the pan of caramel and whisk together until well blended.Pour the caramel/gelatin mixture over the whipped cream and gently fold together until all of the caramel is incorporated into the cream.TO ASSEMBLE THE TORTE: Remove the chocolate torte from the refrigerator and carefully slice in half horizontally. remove the top half of the torte by placing a plate covered in plastic wrap over the top of the torte and inverting just the top half of the torte on to it.Rip off a piece of wax paper long enough to wrap around the perimeter of the torte. Fold the paper in half horizontally and wrap in around the base of the torte. while holding on to the paper to keep it in place, bring the sides of the spring form pan down over the paper(so that the paper is on the inside) and fasten it to the bottom of the springform pan.Place 1/3 of the caramel mousse on top of the torte and spread to even out and level. Very carefully place the top half of the torte on top of the mousse layer.Place half of the remaining caramel mousse on top of the chocolate torte and evenly spread it out.Place the remaining mousse in a large piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe stars of mousse evenly around the perimeter of the torte. Work your way inward, piping stars in circles until you reach the middle of the torte. Pipe on star of mousse in the very center. Chill the torte while you make the truffles.TO FORM THE TRUFFLES: Remove the chilled chocolate/cream mixture from the fridge. Using a very small scoop or a teaspoon, scoop out rounds of chocolate(try to keep them uniform in size) into a bowl of cocoa powder.

Firmly squeeze any excess water from the cauliflower.Remove the cauliflower from the bag/strainer and place in a bowl with remaining ingredients.Stir until thoroughly combined. Spread the mixture on the parchment-lined baking sheets to make two thin circles. With a spatula, press the \"dough\" down so it forms a thin layer. Keep the wraps compact. There should be no parchment paper showing through the mixture.Bake for about 17 minutes, until dry and pliable. Gently remove from oven and transfer to wire rack for cooling.

Set the potatoes aside to cool.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, place the parsnips, celery root, and onions in a food processor and pulse them until finely chopped. Heat the schmaltz or oil in a large saute pan over medium heat, add the chopped vegetables and the bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are completely tender, then uncover and cook for another 10 minutes to let the liquid evaporate. Remove from heat; discard the bay leaves.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and pass them through a ricer into the sauteed vegetable mixture. Add the eggs and season with more salt and pepper; stir with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together. Let cool before forming the knishes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Make the Dough: Place 8 beaten eggs and the schmaltz or oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and add the mixture to the bowl of the stand mixer. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are mostly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough has a smooth, consistent texture, about 1 minute more.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Wrap the dough loosely in plastic wrap and flatten it into a disk. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. (The dough can also be frozen for up to 3 weeks; thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before proceeding.)                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Roll and Trim the Dough: Portion the dough approximately into thirds. Flatten one third with a rolling pin or the palm of your hand to approximately 1/4 inch thick. Pass it through a pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in half, if necessary, and pass it through the rollers 1 or 2 more times until the results yield a piece that is close to the width of the machine (about 6 inches).                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Adding flour as necessary to prevent sticking, continue to pass the dough through the machine, making the setting more narrow with each pass until you achieve a piece that is approximately 1/16 inch thick. Place the dough on a floured surface and cut it into squares. Reserve the trimmings and incorporate into the next piece of dough to be rolled. Repeat with the other two-thirds of the dough.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Stuff and Bake the Knishes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil a 10- by 15-inch baking sheet. Distribute about 1 cup of the filling evenly along one edge of a trimmed dough piece. Roll the dough around the filling to make a cylinder, using a spatula to help lift the bottom of the dough from the work surface where the dough is sticking. Brush the seam of the rolled knish with the egg wash and press lightly to seal it. Place the knish seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces and filling.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Make 4 or 5 diagonal slashes across the top of each knish to allow for expansion while cooking. Brush each knish with a little of the egg wash and sprinkle it with the topping of your choice. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Slice each knish into 4 small logs and serve with the mustard.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mile-ends-knishes-201439", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes":

Fold in chocolate chips and nuts. If for some reason your dough is too soft too scoop (mine wasn't, but it happens with some recipes), just let it sit for a few minutes and it should thicken slightly as it cools.Drop the batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the parchment paper lined cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.On the stovetop in a deep pot, add the oil, curry powder, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 tablespoon grated ginger and cook over low heat until all the ingredients combine together in a paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the scallions and habanero peppers and let simmer 2 to 3 minutes.Add the goat and cooking liquid to the curry paste. Add more water if necessary, and simmer until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Be careful not to overcook as the meat will get mushy and fall apart.Add the potatoes to the meat mixture and simmer until the goat is tender and the potatoes are cooked, about 1/2 hour more. Serve hot with accompaniments.                                                                    Professional Recipe: This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and makes a large quantity. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe in the proportions indicated and therefore cannot make any representation as to the results.                                                    Cook's Note: It is better to have the goat cut when partially frozen to avoid splintering of the bones. Allow each pound goat to cook under pressure for about 10 minutes. If the goat is cooked before serving time, turn off the heat and allow the flavors to mix, then reheat before serving.

Transfer to a saucepan and whisk in the milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until almost simmering (the mixture should be thick enough to coat a spoon). Stir in the maple syrup. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.Make the bacon brittle: Butter a rimmed baking sheet. Cook the bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to paper towels to drain. Let the bacon cool, then very finely chop.Cook the sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until it melts and turns golden, about 4 minutes. (If lumps form, remove from the heat and continue stirring until melted.) Continue to cook, stirring, until light amber, about 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the butter. Carefully stir in the baking soda, then the bacon and chile powder. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet and let cool until set, about 15 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces, then smash about one-third of the brittle into shards with a meat mallet or heavy skillet. Reserve the remaining brittle in a container for up to 3 days.Stir the cream into the chilled custard. Churn in an ice cream maker. Stir in the bacon brittle shards. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.Photograph by Antonis Achilleos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Bob Blumer for Food

Blend together. If using a large bowl, blend together with an immersion blender. Alternatively you can whisk the mixture together but it may be not be as smooth. Add in the melted butter at the end and blend for another minute to make sure it's incorporated.Heat a large non stick skillet over medium heat. Allow the skillet a few minutes to fully heat up. Add a ladle full of crepe batter(how much will depend on how big your pan is, use just enough to cover the pan otherwise your crepes will be thick) to the pan and swirl so that the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan. Once the batter is evenly distributed return the pan to the burner and let cook for 1-2 minutes.When ready to flip the edges should look dry and may pull away from the edge of the pan. Using your hands and a flipper, gently lift the crepe from the pan and flip over. Cook on the other side for about 30 seconds and place on a plate or on the counter with a lid to keep it from drying out.Cook the rest the same way and enjoy!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/whole-wheat-chocolate-crepes-484500", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 25, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["european", "irish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/irish-coffee-745295.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 745295, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Irish Coffee", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 ounces hot filtered coffee", "aisle": "Tea and Coffee", "name": "coffee", "metaInformation": ["hot", "filtered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coffee.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 14209, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 cups granulated Demerara sugar", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "demerara sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10019908, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "Fresh nutmeg, grated, for garnish", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "fresh nutmeg", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "grated", "for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2025, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "1 ounce whipped heavy cream, for garnish", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": ["for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "ounce", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 ounces Powers Gold Label Irish Whiskey", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "irish whiskey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whiskey-bottle.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.5, "id": 14052, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "2 cups water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 14412, "unit": "cups"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 7.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/irish-coffee.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 104, "aggregateLikes": 45, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Add all the ingredients, except the garnish, to an Irish coffee glass.

Add the dry ingredients all at once, and beat on low speed until the batter is just combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and briefly stir to make sure that all the dry ingredients are absorbed. Do not over mix.Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan. Place pan on a cookie sheet and bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out clean. The sides of the cake will begin to pull away from the pan and the center of the cake should not dent when gently touched.Transfer the cookie sheet with pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cookie sheet and leave the cake in the pan, allowing it to cool completely.To make the ganache, heat the heavy cream to a gentle boil and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for a minute or so to let the chocolate melt. Stir gently in a circular motion until smooth.
