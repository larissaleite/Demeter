Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the chard and saute until it wilts, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, wine, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the tomatoes begin to break down and the chard is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season the chard mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring frequently, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the spaghetti. Add the spaghetti to the chard mixture and toss to combine.Transfer the pasta to serving bowls. Sprinkle the olives, cheese, and pine nuts and serve.Recommended Wine: 2001 Clerico TrevigneOrigin: Alba, PiedmontGrape: BarberaWine Notes: This wine is from the north in the Piedmont region of Italy.  I chose a Barbera because I needed a wine to to stand up to the bitterness of the swiss chard and the strong taste of the pecorino cheese.  This wine's texture is smooth and the color is a dark ruby red.  Its bouquet is scorched earth and blackberries with a kiss of oak.  The pasta's flavors do not fight with the taste of the wine but is an explosion of flavor every time you take a bite of spaghetti or a sip of wine.

Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until creamy. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to spread, about 10 minutes. (If the frosting is too thick, microwave in 10-second intervals for up to 30 seconds to soften.)Put one cake layer on a platter; spread 1 heaping cup frosting on top. Add another cake layer, more frosting and the last cake layer. Cover the top and sides with the remaining frosting. Press the reserved cake crumbs all over the cake.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chocolate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cake                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/c/chocolate.html\">Chocolate</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/b/birthday-cake-recipes.html\">Cake</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blackout-cake-with-chocolate-crunch-744454", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Peanut Butter and Peepers", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Strawberry-Softserve-510991.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 510991, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Strawberry Softserve", "preparationMinutes": 2, "pricePerServing": 242.13, "creditText": "Peanut Butter and Peepers", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 Banana, frozen", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "banana", "metaInformation": ["frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9040, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 tbsp. whip cream, fat free", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "cream", "metaInformation": ["fat free"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "6 oz Vanilla Greek Yogurt, fat free", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "fat free vanilla greek yogurt", "metaInformation": ["fat free"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-vanilla-pudding.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 99033, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp.

That way some apples are soft and some have a bit more texture in the pie, allowing for some really awesome flavor and texture!When your apples are almost cooked through, add in your Cinnamon, Pinch of Salt, Vanilla Extract, Spritz of Lemon Juice and I also like to add another tablespoon or so of your favorite fat {there's never a thing as too much butter ;) }. Mix it all together well and let your apples finish cooking.When your sweet potato is fork tender, drain it and add in your fat of choice {as much or as little as you want}, Raw Honey, Cinnamon, Vanilla Extract and mash/ mix it well.By now your apples should be done and wicked yummy. Add them into your pie pan and spread them out into an even layer.Then add in your slightly beaten egg to your sweet potato, give it a quick mix about and spread it ontop of the apples.Place in the oven to bake for 15-25 minutes or until the top has set a little and has a pretty golden color.Try to let it cool before diving in! It does slice/serve better when you let it cool down a lot. But as you can see from the pictures, I have no patience for that hahah :)", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sweet-potato-apple-pie-478378", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false,

Transfer the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in theoven until ready to serve.For the duck breasts: Season the duck breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and place skin-side down in a cast iron pan. Cook slowly over medium heat, draining the rendered fat from the pan a few times, until the skin is very crisp, about 25 minutes. Turn the breasts over and continue cooking to medium and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 140 degrees F. Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.For the candied kumquats: Bring the reserved 1 cup gastrique to a boil in a small saucepan, reduce the heat to low, add the kumquarts and cook until soft and candied, about 20 minutes.For the cranberry relish: Combine the orange juice and honey in a small saute pan, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by a quarter, about 3 minutes. Add the cranberries and cook until they pop and the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes more. Set aside until ready to serve.To serve: Spoon some of the gastrique onto 4 large dinner plates. Top with the duck confit and the sliced duck and spoon some of the cranberries and kumquarts on the sides. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.

It should not be mushy or crunchy, but al dente (to the tooth).Remove from heat and stir in the asparagus. Season well with salt and black pepper. Serve hot.

Using the flat beater attachment, beat for 30 to 60 seconds on speed 2 and mix for 30 to 60 seconds. Add more water if the dough is too dry, in 1/2 Tablespoon increments.Remove flat beater and change with the dough hook. Knead for 2 minutes on speed 2. Remove the dough and knead by hand for 2 minutes on a marble pastry board. Allow the dough to rest covered for 20 to 30 minutes.Cut dough into four pieces before processing with pasta sheet attachment. Work with one piece at a time, be sure to cover the other pieces of dough. Take one piece and flatten into a rectangular shape. Add flour to both sides. Attach the pasta sheet roller to your stand mixer and set it to #1. Turn on the stand mixer to speed 2 and run the pasta dough through the pasta sheet roller. While on #1, fold the dough in half and run it through again. I do this several times. Add flour to both sides as needed during this process.Add a little bit of flour on each side of the dough/sheet between in pass through the pasta sheet roller, change setting to #2 and pass the pasta dough through the sheet roller twice. Change to #3 and pass the pass the pasta through twice and then the same for #4.After rolling the pasta out, I get my ravioli maker out and lay the pasta sheet on top of the filler (white plastic). Push the pasta sheet into the ravioli cavities and adjust the sheet as needed. Fill each ravioli with about a teaspoon, I use my fingers to ensure it gets all the way in there and there's no air pockets.After you're finished filling your pasta, add another pasta sheet on top and using your hands, you're going to push down to ensure the sheets are pressed together; you don't want any air pockets.Then cut the pasta sheet at the end with kitchen shears.Once again, press down with your hands and pat it a little, we want to make sure to seal the raviolis. Flip the ravioli filler and remove the filled pasta sheets. Then put the ravioli cutter on the ravioli sheets and line it up correctly. And then flip it over with the ravioli sheets. We're going to use this to cut the raviolis. Run a rolling pin over the top, back and forth. Gently pull apart the raviolis and you're done.To make baked or fried ravioli appetizers, see below. When boiling your ravioli pasta, it only needs 5 to 7 minutes to boil, for frozen pasta just add a couple of minutes longer.Baked or Fried RavioliPut the beaten eggs into a shallow dish. Into another shallow dish, add breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, parsley and salt and pepper and mix to combine. With one hand, dip one ravioli in the egg and place into the breadcrumb mixture. With your other hand, add breadcrumbs and shake off excess. Place on a plate and repeat.Baked RavioliHeat oven to 400 degrees F. Cover a baking sheet with foil and place a baking rack on top. Spray raviolis that have been covered in breadcrumbs with non-stick cooking spray. Place raviolis on top of backing rack on the cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes and then flip and bake for another 5 minutes or until both sides are golden brown and crispy. Serve immediately with your favorite tomato sauce for dipping.Fried RavioliAdd butter and olive oil to a non-stick pan and heat on medium. Cook in batches, 2 to 3 minutes per side (4 to 5 minutes if frozen). Remove from pan and place on a paper towel lined plate.
