Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil leaving overhang (you must line your pan), spray with cooking spray; set aside. For the Crust - In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter on high power, about 1 minute; set aside. Add the ground cookies and stir to combine (grind cookies with a food processor or place them in a sealed plastic ziptop bag and gently mash the outside of the bag with a drinking glass or roll over the bag with a rolling pin). Transfer crumb mixture to prepared pan and pack it down firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a flat-bottomed drinking glass. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or just until set; don't worry if it's a bit underbaked as pan will be going back into the oven in the next step. For the Topping - Evenly sprinkle the marshmallows over the crust. Evenly sprinkle the caramels, making sure to do it in that order. Bake for about 5 to 8 minutes or until marshmallows and caramel have begun to melt and remove pan before marshmallows start browning or developing color. Immediately upon removing pan from oven, evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips, pressing them down very lightly with a spatula if desired. The carryover heat will melt the chocolate just slightly and embed them into the melted marshmallows and caramel. Allow bars to set up for at least 2 hours before slicing; pan can be placed in the refrigerator to expedite.  Slice bars by lifting them out using the foil overhang and transfer to a cutting board. Bars will keep in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to one week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Recipe may be kept vegan by replacing the butter with margarine or Earth Balance and by using vegan marshmallows and caramels. Oreos are Accidentally Vegan. Recipe may be kept gluten-free by using a gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookie.

For the cookie batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the butter until smooth. Add the sugar and continue mixing until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, 5 to 8 minutes.In another bowl, combine and mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon and nutmeg.Mix and roll the cookies: Because this dough has a good amount of butter, it needs resting time and needs to be rolled fairly quickly. Lay 3 large pieces of wax paper in a single layer on a flat surface. Sprinkle each one with a light coating of flour. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, blend the flour mixture in with the butter. When the ingredients are fully integrated, place one-third of the batter on each of the pieces of wax paper. Coat with another light layer of flour and top with another piece of wax paper of the same length to make 3 dough \"sandwiches.\" Press these wax paper and dough sandwiches down with your hands until the dough is fairly thin. This will save a lot of time on rolling later on. Place 2 of them in the refrigerator and work with them one at a time. Roll the first batch into as neat a shape as possible. What matters most is avoiding creases or cracks and getting it to about 1/8 inch in thickness. When the first is rolled, refrigerate it and repeat the same process for the other 2. Let them chill at least 10 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Make the cookie bottoms: Remove the first rolled sheet from the refrigerator and cut as many 1 1/2-inch hearts (or rounds) as you can. Reserve the scraps in the refrigerator. Arrange the hearts neatly in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with the other 2 sheets, reserving any scraps.Make the cookie tops: Cut a heart, with the smaller cutter, out of the center of half of all the cookies. Roll the scraps in between 2 of the pieces of wax paper and cut additional hearts, if desired.Bake and assemble the cookie sandwiches: Bake the cookies until they are lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the trays from the oven and allow them to cool slightly on the tray for a few minutes before gently transferring them to a flat surface.Place the raspberry jam in a small pot and bring it to a light simmer. Remove from the heat to cool slightly as well. Spoon 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon raspberry jam on each bottom and place a top heart on squarely on each. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.

"instructions": "Wash and scrub ginger to remove all traces of dirt (break off limbs to be sure you get all the stray dirt in the crevices). You do not have to peel the ginger, especially if using young ginger. Cut into 1-inch pieces. Microwave 1 1/2 cups of water with sugar until warm and stir until sugar is completely dissolved. (You can use anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of sugar in the concentrate depending on how sweet you want your ginger concentrate: if you will be using this recipe for moscow mules, which adds sweet ginger liqueur, you may want to use less sugar. But if you will be using it in other recipes, or drinking it straight up with soda, you might find you prefer it a bit sweeter.) Blend ginger with 1 cup of sugar water until smooth and no large chunks remain. Strain through a fine mesh sieve, pushing out as much liquid as possible. Return pulp to blender along with remaining sugar water, and blend again until smooth (this 'second pass' will extract even more ginger juice and will make your ginger go even further). Pour into strainer. If necessary, rinse blender with another 1/4 cup or so of filtered water to get out any remaining ginger pulp. Press through sieve to remove as much ginger juice as possible. Discard solids (or save it to use in Asian recipes, broths or stir frys, for extra ginger flavor). Add lime juice (if you want more of it than is already in the concentrate) to taste and stir to combine. This ginger concentrate will keep, refrigerated in a bottle or other airtight container, for up to a month. Stir well before using as some settling is normal. You can also freeze the concentrate in ice cube trays and store the cubes for up to 6 months.For Moscow Mules: Add ginger concentrate, vodka, and ginger liqueur to a chilled copper mug with ice. Stir to combine. Add lime juice to taste (if desired), and top with a sprig of mint for garnish.

Let mixture heat until it nearly boils, about 180 degrees.  Remove from heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until cool and thickened.  Don\u2019t chill too long or it will be too thick to incorporate whipped cream.While chocolate mixture is chilling, place heavy whipping into chilled bowl.  Whip on medium high using a stand mixer or hand held mixer until stiff peaks form.  You can test this by lifting up the beater \u2013 if the cream forms a peak and the peak doesn\u2019t fall over then you\u2019ve reached the stiff peak stage.  Be careful not to over beat your cream.  Cover and chill until chocolate mixture is ready.Take 1/4 of the whipped cream and stir it right into the chocolate mix.  This will lighten the mix enough to accept the remaining cream without deflating it.  Fold the remaining cream into the chocolate in two or three additions, adding more when the previous addition has started to incorporate.  Once you add the last addition of cream, grate the carob or chocolate chips directly over the mousse with a rotary cheese grater then continue folding.  Resist the temptation to stir.  Just keep folding until your mousse is nearly homogeneous.  Cover and chill overnight.Crush the toasted pecans and coconut with your fingers.

Scrub the potatoes and dry well. Bake directly on the middle oven rack until easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven; let cool 5 minutes.Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the ham and leek; cook, stirring occasionally, until the leek is wilted, about 6 minutes. Add the cauliflower and chicken broth; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Uncover and lightly mash the cauliflower. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until the liquid evaporates, 2 to 3 more minutes.One at a time, hold each potato with a kitchen towel and halve lengthwise. Scoop the flesh into a large bowl, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Mash the flesh with 2 tablespoons butter, the heavy cream and cheese until almost smooth and the cheese melts. Stir in the ham mixture, parsley and mustard; season with salt and pepper. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter; brush the potato skins with some of the butter and season the insides with salt and pepper. Set on a baking sheet. Add the breadcrumbs to the remaining melted butter.Mound the filling into the potato skins and sprinkle the tops with the breadcrumb mixture. Return to the oven on the top rack and bake until the filling starts browning and the skins are crisp, 18 to 20 minutes.Photograph by Ryan Liebe

Add molasses and water; mix well. Combine flour, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and baking soda. Add to creamed mixture; mix well. Cover and chill for at least 3 hours.                                                                                           Spray the outside of 1-1/2-qt. ovenproof glass bowl with cooking spray. Invert bowl and place on ungreased baking sheet. On a floured surface, roll out chilled dough into a 1/4-in.-thick circle. Gently transfer dough circle to the outside of the bowl; press dough firmly around bowl. Trim edge of dough 1 in. above bowl rim with a pastry cutter or knife. Cover and refrigerate remaining dough to use for cookies.                                                                                           If desired, use the 1-in. tree cookie cutter to cut out shapes around dough bowl. (Be sure to invert the cookie cutter so that when bowl is turned right side up, the shapes with be right side up also.) Chill for 20 minutes.                                                                                           Bake at 350\u00b0 for 20-25 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool gingerbread on bowl. Gently twist bottom of gingerbread bowl until it releases; invert and carefully remove bowl.                                                                                        Place bowl on 9-in. plate or platter. Add candy around bottom of bowl.                                                                                           On a floured surface, roll out reserved dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-1/2-in. cookies cutters. Place cutouts on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.                                                                                           In a large bowl, beat the butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Tint as desired. Decorate cookies as desired and serve in bowl.                                        Yield: 1 bowl and 1 dozen cookies.                                                                                                     Crafter thoughts: \u2014If you cut out shapes in the sides of your bowl with a cookie cutter, like we did, you'll want to line the bowl with a bright napkin. The cloth will add color to the outside by showing through the cutouts and keep the goodies on the inside. \u2014With the dough that's left after you've made the bowl, you can cut out cookies  just as we did. Or try shaping little containers by forming the dough over custard cups. Once they've baked and cooled, you can fill the cups with nuts or candies.

After they're cooked, submerge them in cold water and keep them there until you're ready to use them. This will keep them from sticking together and will also help you handle them better because they'll be chilled.Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and spray the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.In a small food processor, process roasted red peppers, garlic, and olive oil until all is combined and the roasted red peppers are finely processed. Save about  cup of the red pepper mixture.In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining roasted red peppers and shredded chicken.In another bowl, stir together ricotta, mozzarella, salt, and pepper.To assemble lasagna rolls: place wax paper on a flat surface then drain and pat dry the lasagna sheets and line them up on the wax paper. Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture onto a lasagna sheet. Using your fingers, push/spread the mixture across the entire sheet. Place a generous portion of the chicken mixture on top of the ricotta and again, using your fingers, push/spread the mixture across the entire sheet.

Add the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup at a time until the mixture will hold together well.Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls and place in the prepared baking pan.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.While the meatballs chill, heat the hot sauce, butter, grapeseed oil, brown sugar, vinegar and salt in a small sauce pot over low heat and whisk to combine.  Whisk occasionally until bubbles form around the edges.  Allow the sauce to bubble for about 5 minutes and then remove from the heat.  The sauce should thicken slightly.  After chilling, remove the meatballs from the refrigerator.  Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Add about 1/4 \u2013 1/2 inch of grapeseed oil.  Once hot, add a single layer of meatballs and cook for about 4 minutes, then flip them, and cook for an additional 4 minutes.  The meatballs should be browned and cooked through; if not, allow them to cook for a couple more minutes, flipping often.  Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the meatballs.  Transfer the cooked sauce to a large bowl.  Add the meatballs about 10 at a time and toss to coat.  Transfer the coated meatballs to a serving dish and repeat with the others. Serve warm.   Cassie's Notes:If you prefer to make these even more healthy, skip the frying.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees and oil a 10x15 baking dish with grapeseed oil.  Place the meatballs in the dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping once, until cooked through.

Cook both just until tender but still crisp. Remove topping from heat and set aside.  Add wine to beans, raise heat and cook for a few minutes more.  Remove from heat and squeeze the tablespoon of lemon juice over the green beans. Before serving, remove and discard thyme sprig from quinoa.

"instructions": "In a medium heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, combine butter, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and egg yolks.Cook and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until butter is melted and mixture is thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes. Do not allow mixture to boil or the egg yolks will curdle. Remove pan from heat.In a medium mixing bowl, combine cake flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the milk and lemon juice together. Set aside. Tip: Dont worry if the milk appears to curdle.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, lemon zest, and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter and lemon zest in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter and lemon zest about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended. Set aside.In another large mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy, add the cream of tartar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold about  of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten the batter, and then fold the remaining egg whites in.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and place pans on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pans and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.In a large bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, vanilla, confectioners sugar, and whipping cream; use an electric mixer and beat together until mixture is smooth and stiff peaks form, about 2 to 4 minutes. Do not overbeat.Mascarpone frosting should be used immediately, or refrigerate until needed.Use a long serrated kitchen knife to split each cake layer into 2 horizontal layers.Place one of the split cake layers on a serving plate; spread  of the chilled lemon curd (about  cup) over the layer leaving about  inch border all around. Repeat with the second and third layers. Place the last cake layer on top.Use an offset spatula to spread Mascarpone Cheese Frosting over top and sides of cake. If desired, reserve about 1 cups frosting to decorate top using a pastry bag and pastry tip and use a pastry comb around the side of the cakePlace fresh lemon slices, cut in half, on top of cake.Cover and refrigerate before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.Immediately pour the hot mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the lemon zest pieces and any bits of egg that may have curdled. Pour into an airtight container and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lemon-layer-cake-610486", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 395, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Sugar Free Mom", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthier-Whole-Wheat-Apple-Pie--No-Sugar-Added-556780.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 556780, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Healthier Whole Wheat Apple Pie: No Sugar Added", "preparationMinutes": 0, "creditText": "Sugar Free Mom", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 egg white", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "10 cups Granny Smith apples, peeled, thinly sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "granny smith apples", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "thinly sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grannysmith-apples.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 10.0, "id": 1029003, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9152, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2025, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Healthier Whole Wheat Pie Crust", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "pie crust", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 18334, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1-1/2 tablespoon powdered stevia", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "stevia", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/stevia.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93628, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons whole wheat pastry flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "whole wheat pastry flour", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10020080, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 31.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/healthier-whole-wheat-apple-pie-no-sugar-added/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 610, "instructions": "Pour 1 tablespoon of lemon juice over sliced apples and toss.In a small bowl mix cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and stevia.Toss over apples and carefully mix.In a large Dutch oven or pot place 6 cups of the sliced apples and cook over medium heat until tender, about 10 minutes.Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the sliced apples.Add the whole wheat pastry flour to the apples and stir to combine.Cool for 30 minutes.Position rack on the lower third of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.Add apples into prepared bottom pie crust, then cover apples with top crust.

Add the corn and cook, stirring, until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl to cool slightly, and then stir in the cheese.Insert a thin paring knife into the thickest part of the chicken breast and cut down the side to make a 3-inch pocket. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Then evenly stuff with the kale mixture.Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Rub the chicken breasts with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and sprinkle with a total of 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add all 4 chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Then lower heat to medium. Continue cooking, turning once halfway through, until just cooked through, about 14 minutes more. Insert a small paring knife into the top of the chicken to test for doneness. If any pink areas remain, cover the skillet and continue to cook until opaque.Transfer the chicken and any bits of filling that fell into the skillet onto 4 plates. Stir the broth and flour together in a small bowl and then add to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the pan sauce over the chicken.Copyright 2012 Television Food Network, G.P.
