Bring to a boil for just 30 seconds. Remove from heat and pour into 13 x 9-inch baking pan that has been sprayed with cooking spray.For filling, combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.Roll dough into a 15 x 10-inch rectangle using a rolling pin. Spread 3 tablespoons butter over dough stopping at least -inch from the edges on the long sides. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture. Beginning at long end of each rectangle, roll up tightly. Pinch seams to seal. Cut into 12 equal pieces. TIP: Use unflavored dental floss instead of a knife to cut rolls. To do, cut a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Slide floss under the roll; bring the ends up and cross over to cut each slice. Place, cut sides down, in prepared pan. Cover with towel; let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour .Bake in preheated 350F oven for 28 to 33 minutes or until rolls are golden brown. Cool on wire rack for 5 minutes and then invert onto serving tray. Gently pour any caramel remaining in the baking pan over the rolls.Before serving, top each roll with a small sprinkling of fine sea salt.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

in a small pot, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.Put the jalapenos in a heatproof 1-pint jar and pour the hot pickling mixture over them. Allow them to sit and soak up the flavor for 30 minutes up to overnight-the longer they sit, the more they will soften and absorb flavor.

For the crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil. Finely grind the almonds, cracker crumbs, and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and process until moist crumbs form. Press the almond mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan (not on the sides of the pan). Bake the crust until it is set and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Cool. Decrease the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.For the filling: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan. Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the center of the cheesecake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold). Transfer the cake to a rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. For the topping: Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl. Heat in the microwave until warm, stirring every 20 seconds to blend, about 1 minute. Cut the cake into wedges. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the wedges and serve.
