(The millet can be made up to 2 days ahead and reheated in the microwave.)Make the yogurt-hummus sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, hummus, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and hot sauce in a small bowl.Make the tomato-pepper salad: Stir together the tomatoes, peppers, parsley and a pinch of salt in another small bowl.Assemble the salad: Using four 16-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids, evenly divide the beets among the jars, then add the following in separate layers: the millet (press it down a little to make room), grape leaves, tomato-pepper salad, cucumbers and yogurt-hummus sauce. Top each with a sprinkling of za'atar. Pack the french-fried onions (about 2 tablespoons per salad) and the lemon wedge in separate small containers for transporting.Just before serving, transfer the jarred ingredients to a large bowl, add the onions and a squeeze of lemon juice and toss.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Bake at 350\u00b0 for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
