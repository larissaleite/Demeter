Stir until mixed.  Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes.Meanwhile, line a baking pan or casserole dish with parchment or waxed paper, using a large enough piece (or multiple pieces) to ensure all sides of the pan or dish are covered.  Side note:  In my opinion, the size of the dish only matters if you want \"tall\" marshmallows. While this recipe says it makes 16 one-inch square marshmallows, mine turned out much thinner because I used a 4-quart, 15\" x 10\" oblong casserole baking dish.  Just because.  If you want tall marshmallow, I suggest trying a meatloaf pan.Next, sprinkle enough confectioners\u2019 sugar into the lined pan to completely and generously cover the bottom. Reserve the remaining confectioners\u2019 sugar for later use.In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together 1 tablespoon of Bailey's, granulated sugar, corn syrup, 2 tablespoons water and salt. Without stirring, bring the mixture to a boil and continue cooking until the temperature reads 238\u00b0F to 240\u00b0F on your thermometer.  I used a regular meat thermometer that had a metal clip to hold it in place on the side of pan.  You can also use a digital thermometer if you have one.

Side note:  In my opinion, the size of the dish only matters if you want \"tall\" marshmallows. While this recipe says it makes 16 one-inch square marshmallows, mine turned out much thinner because I used a 4-quart, 15\" x 10\" oblong casserole baking dish.  Just because.  If you want tall marshmallow, I suggest trying a meatloaf pan.Next, sprinkle enough confectioners\u2019 sugar into the lined pan to completely and generously cover the bottom.
