Remove from oven and let cool. 2 Drain or strain any liquid from pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Take pumpkin pur\u00e9e and place on several layers of paper towels. Cover with several layers of paper towels and use your hands to gently squeeze out as much liquid as you can from the pur\u00e9e. Not that you will probably go through a lot of paper towels (can use tea towels too). Two 15-ounce cans of pur\u00e9ed pumpkin should yield a little more than 2 cups of pur\u00e9e, with the excess moisture removed. You want exactly 2 cups of the pur\u00e9e.3 Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ground ginger, grated nutmeg, and allspice in a medium bowl. With a wooden spoon (no need for a mixer for this step), mix in the salt, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, vanilla, and bourbon. Beat in the eggs.4 In a large bowl, (helps to use a mixer for this step) combine the cream cheese and the brown sugar until fully creamed and smooth (no lumps).

Lightly coat a 8 x 8 inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.Combine the polenta, water, and kosher salt in a 2-quart baking dish. Stir together, and place in the oven. Bake 50 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir in the butter and return to the oven for 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven and stir again. Return to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, and stir in the Parmesan. Pour into the prepared 8 x 8 inch baking dish and smooth the top. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Oil a 2-quart gratin dish. Cut the polenta into squares or rectangles, and arrange the polenta in the dish, overlapping the pieces slightly. Spread the tomato sauce over the slices, and sprinkle with Parmesan. Drizzle olive oil over the top.Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until sizzling. Remove from the heat and serve with Tuscan White BeansTUSCAN WHITE BEANS: Rinse beans with cool water, removing any broken, blistered, or brown beans. Drain.Soak the beans: In a large bowl, cover beans by 3 inches with cold water, cover and set aside at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight, up to 12 hours (soaking for longer will cause the beans to absorb too much liquid and loose their texture and flavor). If preparing more than 12 hours in advance, drain the soaked beans, then refrigerate until ready to use.{For a quicker soak in place of the step above}: In a large pot, cover beans by 3 inches with cold water, cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, remove pot from heat and set aside, covered, for 1 hour.Place the soaked beans in a large pot and cover with water to 3/4 inch above the level of the beans. Bring to a boil. Once beans are boiling, skim off any foam that has risen to the surface. Add sage, then reduce heat so that the beans bubble steadily, but not vigorously. Cover loosely.Continue to cook, stirring occasionally until the beans begin to soften, 30 to 45 minutes. If the beans become dry while cooking, add water one cup at a time as needed. Once the beans are soft, add kosher salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the beans are very tender, about 15 additional minutes.Drain any excess cooking liquid. Stir in garlic and olive oil.
