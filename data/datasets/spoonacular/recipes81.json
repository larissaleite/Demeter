milk, butter, sugar, yeast and eggs. Whisk to combine.Put the dough hook on the mixer. Add salt and 4 cups of flour, one cup at a time with the mixer on low. Add just enough flour so that the dough comes together in a ball away from the sides -- once it's not sticking to the sides anymore, stop adding flour (even if you haven't used all 4 cups). If you've used all 4 cups and the dough is still sticking, add a little bit of extra flour as necessary.Spray a piece of plastic wrap with non stick spray and cover the dough. Place in a somewhat warm, draft-free spot (like an oven that's not on) for 1-1.5 hours until doubled.Meanwhile, make your filling.In a medium pot, combine cranberries, water and sugar and bring to a simmer over medium high heat. Reduce to medium heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst and are soft. Smash cranberries with the back of your spatula.Stir together corn starch and 2 teaspoons water. Stir into cranberry sauce and let thicken. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature (you can speed this up in the fridge or freezer).Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a 9x13\" pan and an 8x8\" pan.Place dough on a floured surface. Roll out to a rectangle about 10\" by 20-24\". Spread cooled cranberry filling to within 1\" of the edge and roll up, starting at the long edge (be sure not to squeeze too much or you'll lose all your filling!). Slice in 1.5\" slices with a serrated knife and place in your prepared pans. Place in a warm spot to rise for 20-30 minutes while the oven heats.Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the tops are light golden brown all over (even in the middle). Remove from the oven and make your glaze.In a medium bowl, combine white chocolate and cream. Microwave on high for 1 minute, then stir until chocolate is smooth and melted. Whisk in powdered sugar, adding a bit more if necessary to reach desired consistency (knowing that it will thicken somewhat as it cools). My glaze was pretty thin, and it soaked into all the cracks and crevices. If you prefer a thicker glaze, simply add more powdered sugar.Drizzle over warm rolls.

If not, you'll need a standard casserole dish. If you have a food processor, you can use it to quickly and easily chop the onions, carrots, peppers, and zucchini. I suggest chopping each vegetable separately.Make the Potatoes Place the cut potatoes in a large pot halfway filled with water over high heat. Once it comes to a boil, set the timer for 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and mash them with the broth, olive oil, salt and pepper. I like to mash them in the cooking pot, first with a potato masher and then an immersion blender.Cook the Meat and Vegetables Preheat the oven to 400F. Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large (cast iron, if you have it) skillet, over medium heat. Add the lamb and cook, stirring occasionally, until it loses its pinkness. With a slotted spoon, transfer lamb to a bowl. Pour fat out of the skillet and discard or save for another use. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet. Cook onions, carrots and bell pepper over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they get fairly dry and start to brown a bit, 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and zucchini. Cook, stirring, for a minute or so. Return the lamb to the skillet. Add 1 cup broth, tomato paste, thyme, salt, pepper, cayenne and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the corn and peas. Remove from heat.Assemble and Bake the Casserole If using a cast iron skillet, simply even out the ingredients in the skillet using a spatula, and spread the mashed potatoes on top, using a butter knife to even them out. Place the skillet in the top third of the preheated oven and cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes, or until the casserole is heated through and the potatoes are starting to turn golden brown in spots. Remove from the oven and let the casserole rest for 10-15 minutes. Slice into pieces and serve.Note: The casserole is delicious the next day too! Store in the fridge and reheat, covered with foil, in a 325F oven, until heated through - about 40 minutes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/healthy-spicy-shepherds-pie-625822", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/camouflage-salad-736388.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 736388, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Camouflage Salad", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 cups frozen shelled edamame beans, thawed", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "beans", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "shelled", "thawed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 16069, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 4582, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh cilantro", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11165, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19296, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "low sodium soy sauce", "metaInformation": ["low-sodium"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 16424, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 head napa cabbage, shredded", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "napa cabbage", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/napa-cabbage.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11970, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "rice wine vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1022053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "6 scallions, sliced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 11291, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sesame oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4058, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sesame seeds", "metaInformation": ["toasted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12023, "unit": "tablespoon"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 98.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/daphne-brogdon/camouflage-salad.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 333, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Whisk together the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame seeds, honey and sesame oil in a large bowl.

slightly oversized tarte tatin pan) and sear the duck legs, skin-side down over medium heat until the skin turns golden and gives out some oil.Turn the legs over, and take the pan off the heat while you cut the potatoes into 1-inch slices across, then cut each slice into 4. Arrange these potato pieces around the duck legs, then let a few sprigs of thyme fall over the duck and potatoes, and season with salt and pepper, before putting into the preheated oven.Cook for two hours, occasionally turning the potatoes, for optimal outcome, which is tender duck legs and crispy potatoes, though both will be ready to eat after 1 1/2 hours.Making leftovers right: If you have even a small amount of meat left, you could bag and mark it up and store it in the freezer for up to two months for future use.

lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, coconut sugar and tapioca flour. Stir to combine and coat all of the fruit evenly. Pour all of the fruit filling into an 8x8 (or similarly sized) pan and set aside while preparing the crisp topping.In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, rolled oats, and coconut sugar. Add the coconut oil and using a pastry cutter, two forks, or your hands, work the coconut oil into the flour until it comes together into a course meal with no dry flour remaining.

When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place kebabs directly over hot side of grill, cover, and cook, turning occasionally and sprinkling with spice mixture until well charred on both sides and kebabs are cooked through, about 12 minutes total.                                                                                    5

"vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 21, "aggregateLikes": 36, "instructions": "Steam the lobsters1. Place the lobsters in a nonreactive pan, like stainless steel, and add 4 cups of water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. It is important to realize that it may take a while, maybe as long as 10 to 15 minutes, for the liquid to come to a boil. If the lobsters are turning red at this point, move them around a little in the pan to get the ones on top into the hot liquid underneath. Boil gently for 1 or 2 minutes, and then remove them from the heat and let cool in the liquid, covered, for about 30 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid for the herb sauce and the remaining liquid for the bisque.2. To shell the lobsters, first remove the two claws and the tail from each. A great deal of liquid (about 1 1/2 cups) will come out; reserve this for the bisque. Press on the shell of the tail to crack it, and remove the meat from the shell. The meat should be barely cooked. Split the tail in half lengthwise and remove the vein or intestinal tract.3. Cover the claws with a kitchen towel and break them with a heavy objecta can, meat pounder, or skillet. (Placing a towel on top keeps the juices from splattering all over.) When the claws are cracked, try to remove the meat in one piece. Remove and discard the piece of cartilage that is inside each claw. The knobby articulation or joint that connects the claw to the body contains the finest meat in the lobster. Crack or cut this area with scissors and remove the meat.4. In a gratin dish lined with plastic wrap, arrange the meat in per-portion groupings, with half a tail, 1 claw, and some of the pieces from the articulation placed tightly together in one layer in the dish. Cover tightly with the wrap and refrigerate, if preparing the day before.5. When ready to reheat the lobster, melt the butter and pour it over the lobster meat in the gratin dish. Cover again tightly with plastic wrap, so the lobster pieces are soaked in butter. Warm in a very low (130F to 160F / 54C to 71C) oven. The lobster should reheat slowly so it can be served warm and remain very tender. If reheated in hot liquid or in too hot an oven, the meat tends to seize and toughen, so it is important to reheat it slowly and in butter, which will be used to make the herb butter sauce at serving time.Make the lobster bisque6. Discard all the shells except the lobster bodies, where all the appendages are attached. Cut the bodies into four or five pieces each, and place them in one layer in a large saucepan with the olive oil. Cook for 7 or 8 minutes, until the moisture has evaporated and the bodies start to brown. There will be a wonderful aroma from the browning.7. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes for the pieces to brown properly, and then add the chopped onion, leek, celery, and garlic cloves. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. To that, add the white wine, tomato juice or Bloody Mary mix (which gives some zip to the sauce), the reserved juice (about 1 1/2 cups) from shelling the cooked lobsters, and what is left of the cooking broth from the lobsters (beyond the 2 cups already reserved for the herb sauce). Add the herbes de Provence, tarragon, salt, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil and cook gently, partially covered, for 30 to 40 minutes.8. Strain in a colander, pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract all the liquid. Discard the lobster shells, and strain the mixture again through a double-mesh strainer, so it is very smooth. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately. When ready to serve, add the heavy cream and Cognac, bring to a boil, and taste for salt and pepper.Make the herb sauce9. Reduce the reserved lobster broth to 1 cup, to intensify the taste. Thicken it with the 1 teaspoon of potato starch dissolved in the 1 tablespoon of water. This can be done ahead.10. When ready to serve, add the chopped parsley, chives, and tarragon to the sauce. Pour the butter used for reheating the lobster into the sauce, and return the lobster to the warm oven. Bring the sauce to a boil; the butter will be emulsified with the liquid and create a smooth, creamy, and delicate sauce. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If available, add the Asian garlic-chile paste. It gives a special accent to the sauce.Prepare the fingerling potatoes11. Peel the potatoes and cook them in salted water for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on size. Drain at serving time and place them back on the stove for 20 or 30 seconds, so the heat will absorb whatever moisture remains.Prepare the corn12. Cut the kernels off the cob; a good ear of corn will yield about 1 cup of kernels. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the corn kernels and salt and pepper, and cook over high heat, partially covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, until a crust begins to form in the bottom of the pan from the release of sugar from the corn mixing with the oil. This gives it a wonderful aroma and that delightful taste of roasted corn.13. Spoon the corn into the center of six hot dinner plates, place the lobster meat on top, and spoon on some of the sauce. Arrange the potatoes around the corn. Serve the bisque in small cups next to the lobster as an accompaniment.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/steamed-lobster-with-herb-sauce-and-lobster-bisque-598210", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Vegetarian Times", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/almond-lemon-cake-760235.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 760235, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Almond-Lemon Cake", "creditText": "Vegetarian Times", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tsp. baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "Confectioners' sugar, optional", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "confectioners' sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 19336, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc tsp. cream of tartar", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cream of tartar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18373, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "3 egg yolks and 4 egg whites", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolks", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bc cups ground almonds", "aisle": "Gluten Free", "name": "ground almonds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 93740, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup lemon juice", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon juice", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 9152, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbs. lemon zest", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "Tb", "unitShort": "Tbs", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9156, "unit": "Tbs"}, {"originalString": "\u00be cup packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd tsp. salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup unsalted butter, room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp. vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 15.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/almond-lemon-cake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 16, "aggregateLikes": 126, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350F.

Stir until red wine cooks down. Then add thyme and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer, turn heat down to low, and simmer, uncovered, until sauce reduced to 4-5 cups of liquid, about 30-45 minutes.3) For loaf, chop mushrooms, garlic, and leeks and add to a large pan with olive oil over high heat. Cook until veggies reduce down and most of the liquid evaporates, about 15 minutes.4) Let cool to room temperature and then mix with all the other loaf ingredients in a large bowl. You might need to add more or less bread crumbs based on how much liquid your veggies had.5) Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap and scoop in your loaf mixture. Invert on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Remove pan and plastic wrap to leave a free-standing loaf.6) Bake loaf at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove and brush on glaze. Return to the oven to cook for another 15-20 minutes (Note: If you use meat instead of mushrooms, you'll need to cook this for closer to 75 minutes total).7) Back to gravy, mix soft butter, flour, and cream together to form a smooth paste.8) Whisk paste into simmering sauce until smooth. Simmer until thick and silky smooth. Taste for salt and pepper.9) Serve gravy and sliced loaf together.

pimientos and place in a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth. Drain the second jar. Using an electric mixer, combine the Cheddar, cream cheese, pureed pimentos and diced pimientos, beating until smooth. Add the mayonnaise and jalapenos and mix until fully combined.For the fried green tomatoes: Cut the ends off of the tomatoes and slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper.In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. In a third shallow bowl whisk together the panko, cornmeal and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.Working with one tomato slice at a time, first coat the tomato with the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Then coat with the egg mixture, followed by the panko mixture. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes.Heat 2 cups oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in. Carefully place some of the tomatoes into the heated oil in a single layer. Fry until golden, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the frying process with the remaining tomatoes, changing the oil if the particles left in the oil between batches begin to burn.For the BPT: Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until desired crispness, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently spread one side of each slice of bread with the jalapeno pimiento cheese. Arrange the bacon, then the fried green tomatoes and then the lettuce on 4 slices. Top with the remaining slices, and cut each sandwich in half. Serve immediately.

salt in a food processor and pulse to mix. Pulse in butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Pulse in sour cream and oil. With the motor running, add ice water and process just until the dough comes together. (Add more water, a teaspoon at a time, if necessary.) Divide the dough in half, shape into 2 disks, wrap in plastic and refrigerate while you prepare the filling.To prepare filling: Clean the food processor and fit with the shredding disc. Cut potato, carrots (or parsnips) and onion into pieces that will fit through the tube. With motor running, drop in the vegetables until theyre all shredded.Combine beef, pork, milk and the shredded vegetables in a high-sided skillet or Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat, mashing and stirring with a potato masher, until the meat is dry and all the liquid has evaporated (the masher helps you check for liquid), 40 to 50 minutes. If the bottom starts to brown or stick before the liquid has evaporated, reduce the heat and continue cooking and mashing until the liquid is gone. Stir in cranberries, allspice, salt and pepper.Preheat oven to 375F.Roll one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Scrape the filling into the crust and pat down gently. Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch circle and cover the filling with it. Trim the crust so it overhangs evenly. Tuck the top crust under the bottom crust, sealing the two together and making a plump edge. Flute the edge with your fingers or crimp with a fork. Brush the top of the crust with egg white.Bake the pie until the crust is golden, about 45 minutes.

Add in remaining flour in  cup increments until the dough is sticky but not sticking to the sides of the bowl or your hands. Remove dough from mixer bowl and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel and place in a dark warm place. My favorite place is on my dryer while it's running. Rise 1-2 hours or until dough has doubled in size.Carmel Glaze::In a medium saucepan, combine all the ingredients and whisk constantly over medium heat until the butter has melted and the mixture has combined. Remove from heat. Pour half of the caramel glaze into the bottom of a lightly sprayed 13x9 inch baking dish or casserole pan. Set aside the other half the glaze for later.Filling::In a small bowl whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, salt and nutmeg. Roll out proofed dough into a 16 inch by 12 inch rectangle. Pour melted butter over the dough and using a pastry brush distribute the butter over the dough. Sprinkle on the filling over the melted butter. Sprinkle on about half of the cooked and chopped bacon. Starting at the top of the long-edge of the dough, tightly roll the dough in on itself. When you reach the ends of the dough, pinch together the seam and place seam side down. Knick the dough using a VERY sharp knife into 12 sections. Nimbly slice through the 12 sections and place each roll, cut side down,on top of the caramel glaze in the baking dish. Don't pack too tightly, they will need space for a second proofing. Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and let rise again - 1 to 1  hours.Bake rolls in an oven pre-heated to 350 degrees. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the rolls register 180 degrees on an instant read thermometer. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.For Bacon Pecan Topping :: If the caramel glaze has thickened too much, reheat gently. Stir in remaining bacon and chopped pecans. With a serving platter, cover the baking dish and carefully invert the baking dish so the sticky buns fall out onto the serving platter. Top with bacon pecan topping.

Any fat from yolks or oil will make it difficult to beat the egg whites.2 Prepare two 9-inch cake pans. Line the pans with parchment paper or wax paper. Lightly butter the sides of the pans (not the paper).3 Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\u00a0Mix together the ground walnuts and the bread crumbs in a small bowl and set aside. 4\u00a0Place the egg yolks into a mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Slowly add \u00a03/4 cup of white sugar and continue to beat the egg yolks until thick and pale. (I use a hand mixer for this.) 5 Using a stand mixer, beat the egg whites with the whisk attachment until foamy. \u00a0Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of white sugar, and beat until soft peaks form. 6 With a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture, alternately with the walnut mixture.7 Spoon the batter into the prepared, parchment-layered cake pans. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) until a slight imprint remains when touched.  8 While the cake is cooking prepare the mocha frosting base. Place 1/2 cup of white sugar and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch into a saucepan. Turn the heat onto medium and gradually stir in the coffee and the chocolate chips. \u00a0Stir continuously until the mixture starts to simmer and thicken quite substantially. Continue to stir while the mixture simmers for 1 minute. Then remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract until well blended. \u00a0Let cool completely. (You will incorporate this mocha base into whipped cream when you frost the cake.) 9 Remove the cakes from oven and cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Run a dull knife around the edges of the cakes to separate it from the sides of the pans. Carefully invert the cakes onto a rack. Carefully peel back and discard the parchment or wax paper. Let cool completely. \u00a0Note that if you want to make ahead, you can cook the cakes first, let cool to room temp, wrap with plastic wrap, and freeze until you are ready to frost and serve. 10 Complete the frosting. Whip the cream until it is rather thick, just before that point to which if you kept on whipping it would turn to butter. This will help it hold up as a frosting. Once whipped, fold the whipped cream and mocha base together. It may be a little speckled, and if you fold it only lightly, you can have almost a marbling effect of light and dark with the frosting, if you wish. \u00a0Place one cake on a serving platter. Frost the top. Place the second cake on top of it, and frost the top and sides of the cake. \u00a0Serve immediately, or keep chilled until serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven; preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Cut each squash in half lengthwise and scoop out and discard the seeds. Arrange the halves in a large baking dish, flesh-side up.Whisk together the vinegar, 2 tablespoons of the oil and the maple syrup in a cup. Brush the flesh side of the squash halves with some of the maple mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Put the squash flesh-side down in the baking dish, then brush the skin side with maple mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Roast until the squash is fork-tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Poke the inside of the squash halves with a fork and brush generously with more of the maple mixture.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add the quinoa, curry powder, cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon salt and stir until the spices are toasted, about 1 minute. Add 2 cups water and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat, cover the pan and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the quinoa is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 20 to 24 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir in the cranberries, remaining maple mixture, half of the parsley and half of the pistachios.Stuff the squash halves with the quinoa and sprinkle with the remaining parsley and pistachios.

Remove them from the liquid and transfer to a plate. Bubble the liquid until thickened to a glossy glaze.Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a baking tray with foil or baking parchment and place the salmon in the middle  or on an angle to help it fit if you need to. Using a sharp knife, cut the salmon into 8 fillets, cutting through the flesh but not the skin, as this will hold the whole thing together. Cut the thinner end into slighter wider fillets, so everyone gets a similar portion. Brush the salmon with the glaze, making sure you get in between the gaps, and save a little for brushing on at the end. Lay the candied clementine on top, down the centre, and bake for 20 mins.While the salmon is cooking, make the beetroot crme frache by mixing all the ingredients together in a bowl with plenty of black pepper and a little salt  save a few chives to sprinkle on top.

Press on any milk solids and mint leaves to extract all the liquid possible. Give the milk a quick stir to smooth it out and set aside.2. While the mint is steeping in the milk, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a standard muffin tin with paper liners; set aside.3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.4. In an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the butter and sugar together until pale, light, and fluffy (about 5 minutes).5. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and add the eggs one at at time, mixing thoroughly after each addition.6. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the lime zest, lime juice, vanilla extract and rum. Mix until combined. (The mixture may start to look curdled at this point, but don\u2019t worry, it will all come back together, power on!)7. Reduce the mixer speed low. Add the dry ingredients in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk in two batches. Mix only until just incorporated, using a rubber spatula to give it one last mix by hand.8. Divide the batter between the muffin cups. Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until just slightly golden and a skewer shows only moist crumbs attached, rotating the pan at the halfway point.9. While the cupcakes are baking, combine the rum and mint sprigs in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat until the rum is heated through (do not let it simmer). Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let steep until ready to use.10. Allow cupcakes to cool for 5 to 10 minutes and then remove to a cooling rack. Brush the tops of the cupcakes with the mint-infused rum. Set the cupcakes aside to cool completely before frosting them.11. To make the frosting, whip the butter on medium-high speed of an electric mixer using the whisk attachment for 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low and gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing and scraping the sides of the bowl until all is incorporated. Give it a mix on medium speed for about 30 seconds. Add the lime juice and rum and mix on medium-high speed until incorporated and fluffy.
