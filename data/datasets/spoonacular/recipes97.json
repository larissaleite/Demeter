Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form; gently fold into batter.                                                                                           Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

Beat on low speed just until blended; beat on high until smooth. Apply glaze evenly over tops and sides of cake squares, allowing excess to drip off. Let dry. Repeat if necessary to thoroughly coat squares. Let dry completely.                                                                                           For frosting, in a small bowl, cream the butter, shortening and vanilla. Beat in confectioners' sugar and enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Place 1/2 cup each in two bowls; tint one pink and one green.                                                                                           Cut a small hole in the corner of a pastry or plastic bag; insert #104 tip. Fill with pink frosting; pipe a rosebud on each petit four.

Remove any tough or dried out outer leaves. Split each leek in half and check to see if there is any grit between the leaves. If you see any grit at all, wash the leeks well in several changes of water.Cut the leeks crosswise into thin strips. Let the cut up leeks simmer, covered, in abundant olive oil and a pinch of salt, until they are soft and much reduced. Uncover the pot and stir the leeks from time to time; if you notice them coloring at all, add a tad of water to keep them from browning. When the leeks are done, transfer them to a large bowl and let them cool completely. Mix in the eggs and season with a bit more salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Now, fold the ends of the dough back over the filling.Bake the mold in a hot (200C/400F) oven for about 45 minutes, until the filling is complete cooked through and the crust nice and brown.Let the torta cool in its mold for at least 15-20 minute before unfolding and serving.

Place a heavy pot over medium-high heat with at least 1-inch of vegetable oil for boneless chicken and 2 inches for whole pieces. Heat oil to 350 degrees F; it is important to monitor and maintain the temperature, or the soy flour breading and your oil will burn. (Portable deep fryers at home are great for this.)In a medium bowl, mix the eggs and cream to make an egg wash. In a separate larger bowl, mix all the breading ingredients together.Season the chicken well with salt and pepper. Dip it first in the breading, then in the egg wash, and then back in the breading again, making sure to coat well on all sides. Pat off any excess breading and then carefully place into hot oil and fry until golden brown and crisp, just a few minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels.Boneless chicken breasts, if thinly cut, may cook all the way by frying alone, but whole chicken will not because of how fast soy flour browns. It is best to place any chicken you fry with soy flour on a sheet pan and finish by baking at 350 degrees F for an additional 10 minutes for boneless chicken and 20 to 25 minutes more for cut up chicken pieces that have bones. The internal temperature of the chicken should register 165 degrees F. Serve immediately.Cook's Note: Soy flour is made from toasted soybeans and has already been \"cooked.\" Therefore it has a tendency to brown faster than plain flour when frying. Try this same breading for onion rings, baked pork chops, okra, mozzarella sticks, mushrooms, onion rings and eggplant.

Add the flour, butter, sugar, fine salt and 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons warm water; mix with the paddle attachment until a slightly sticky dough forms, 5 minutes.Knead the dough by hand on a floured surface until very smooth and soft, 3 minutes. Roll into a 2-foot-long log; cut into 16 1 1/2-inch-long pieces. Knead each piece slightly and shape into a 7-inch-long breadstick; arrange 2 inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a cloth; let rise in a warm spot until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Make the topping: Brush the breadsticks with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bake until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt with the garlic powder and oregano. Brush the warm breadsticks with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with the flavored salt.Photograph by Kate Sears                                                    Recipe

Using a microplane, grate the garlic on to the cilantro, followed by the lime zest. Toss together and set side.Heat olive oil over medium heat in skillet. Add onions and let cook until onions begin to soften, 3-4 minutes. Next, stir in sweet potatoes and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes.In a mortar and pestle, combine the chipotle, adobo sauce, honey, and lime juice. Break apart the chipotle into small pieces (alternatively, you can cut up the chipotle.) Pour into the pan with the sweet potatoes and reduce the heat to medium-low.Cook until sweet potatoes have softened, 10-15 minutes.When ready to make quesadillas, preheat grill or skillet over medium-low. Brush one side of the quesadilla with olive oil.

Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a large, microwave-safe bowl melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power. Wait momentarily before adding the egg so you don't scramble it. Add the egg, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, optional salt, and whisk until smooth. Add the flour and stir until just combined, don't overmix. Stir in 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips over the top, pressing them down very lightly with a spatula. Bake for about 32 to 34 minutes, or until done. I prefer them very moist, soft, and fudge-like, and baked for 32 minutes (shown in photos). If you prefer more well-done, dryer bars, bake for a few minutes longer; noting baking times may vary widely with this recipe based on personal preferences. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter; however, it will be hard to find a clean patch to test because you'll likely hit chocolate. Allow bars to cool in pan for at least 30 to 60 minutes before slicing and serving; I prefer to let these bars rest overnight so the flavors marry and the chocolate fully sets, at which point they're fudge-like. Bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/soft-and-chewy-gingerbread-molasses-chocolate-chip-bars-520660", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 1, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Home Cooking Adventure", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chocolate-Cake-550870.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 550870, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chocolate Cake", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Home Cooking Adventure", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "200 g butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 200.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "150 g dark chocolate", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "dark chocolate", "metaInformation": ["dark"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 150.0, "id": 19904, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "4 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3 tbsp flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "8 tbsp sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 8.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 85.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.homecookingadventure.com/recipes/chocolate-cake", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 144, "aggregateLikes": 11, "instructions": "Butter 10-inch(26 cm) springform pan(with a removable base), and dust with flour.\u00a0Melt chocolate and butter over a bain-marie until smooth.

Fill a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with at least 2 inches of vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.2. While you wait for the oil to come up to temperature, combine all of the other ingredients (except the powdered sugar) in a small saucepan over very low heat. Whisk together the ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Turn the heat off and let the batter rest until the oil is ready. Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside.3. Once the oil reaches 300 degrees F, use a medium cookie scoop to scoop the batter and drop into the oil. Don't overcrowd the pot, ensuring that each zeppole has enough space to fry. Once the bottom side is golden brown, gently flip the zeppole over and continue frying until the other side is golden brown. This should take anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes total.
