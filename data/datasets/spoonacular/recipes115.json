Melt butter in the skillet, swirling it around to coat the skillet with a thin layer of butter. Add smoked salmon pieces to the skillet and saute for 1 minute, stirring constantly.Turn heat down to medium low. Add eggs, goat cheese and fresh dill to the skillet. Keep the heat on medium/medium low, you don't want to rush it here-- if the skillet is too hot the eggs will cook too quickly and become rubbery. Once you pour the eggs in they will begin to cook immediately. Using a spatula (I use a wooden spatula so I won't damage my nonstick coating), begin pulling the cooked outer edges in towards the center of the eggs. Uncooked eggs will flood the area you just pulled back. Move the spatula around the edge of the skillet, pulling the cooked edges towards the center and re-flooding repeatedly. Cooked scrambled eggs will gather in the center of the skillet. At a certain point, the uncooked eggs will no longer flood and the scramble will all collect in the center of the skillet, but it will still be slightly runny in texture. Begin breaking up the scramble; quickly turn undercooked areas and keep the scramble moving to make sure that all surfaces cook evenly. Never leave a surface in contact too long with the skillet or it will become overcooked.Turn off the heat when the eggs are 90% cooked. When the eggs are done, serve immediately. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste-- the smoked salmon is salty already, so taste before you season.Serve with a little sour cream or labaneh cheese on the side (optional).

If you are using small red potatoes, halve or quarter them in the same way. Cover a large cookie sheet with foil. Place potatoes on cookie sheet. Combine with peppers and onions, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Coat the potatoes, peppers and onions with extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat vegetables in a thin layer, 2 to 3 tablespoons. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Place potatoes in the oven and roast 20 to 22 minutes, until potatoes are just tender and peppers and onions are crisp at edges. Toss mixture with tongs, turning the potatoes after 15 minutes. When the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a serving dish and peel the foil off the cookie sheet and discard for super-quick clean up!While potatoes cook, prepare chicken. Roll out a 2-foot piece of waxed paper or foil near the stove top. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat -- your pan must be very hot when the chicken is added. Pile the shredded cheese on the work surface created with the waxed paper or foil. Season your chicken breasts with black pepper but no salt; the cheese will add enough salt to the taste of the dish. Press the breasts firmly into the cheese. Coat both sides of breasts with as much cheese as possible. Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan. Set breasts into the skillet and cook 7 minutes on each side, until cheese forms an even, golden casing around the tender chicken breasts. While chicken cooks, combine chopped tomatoes with basil in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.Drain off any excess oil from chicken as you remove it from the skillet. Top chicken with big spoonfuls of raw sauce and serve with potatoes, peppers and onions.

Process the cookies and granulated sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and creme de menthe, and pulse until moist. Press the crumbs into a 9-inch pie plate, and bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool completely on a wire rack.For the filling: Microwave the marshmallows and butter in a microwave-proof bowl on high until the butter is melted and the marshmallows have broken down, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine, and let cool for 5 minutes.Beat the creme de menthe and heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy peaks form, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer, add 1/3 of the cooled marshmallow mixture and beat on medium-high until combined, about 15 seconds; repeat with the remaining marshmallow mixture in 2 batches. (The whipped cream won't hold its peaks, and the cream-marshmallow mixture will appear quite loose, but it firms quickly as it cools in the pie crust.) Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust. Cover the pie with plastic, and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or overnight.For the chocolate mint whipped cream: Beat the confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder and peppermint extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium high speed until combined. Add the heavy cream, and beat on medium-high until fluffy peaks form.To assemble: Arrange the wafer cookies on top of the pie. Top each cookie with 1/2 teaspoon creme de menthe (it will soak in almost immediately). Transfer the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip, and pipe it onto the soaked cookies. Garnish with mint leaves. The pie can be refrigerated, loosely covered, up to overnight or served immediately. Serve with any extra leftover whipped cream on the side.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.  All rights reserved.

"instructions": "1 Prepare the pita rounds: Use scissors to cut around the edge of each pita to make two thin rounds. Separate the rounds and set them on baking sheet with the rough sides facing up.2 Cut the mozzarella: Use a thin, sharp knife to slice the mozzarella as thinly as possible. It doesnt matter if you dont make even or perfect rounds.3 Assemble the pizzas: Divide the mozzarella among the pitas. The cheese doesn't need to cover the rounds completely. Add a few slices of the large tomatoes, enough to almost cover the mozzarella. Fill in the gaps with cherry tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.4 Cook the pizzas: Heat a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes, until a flick of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Add 1 pizza round and cover the pan. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the mozzarella melts at the edges. Use a wide metal spatula to lift the pizza out of the pan and transfer to a plate. Cook the remaining pizzas in the same way. (If you have more than one skillet, use them to cook several pizzas at once.)5 Cut the basil: While the pizzas are cooking, prepare the basil. Stack the leaves on top of each other, then roll them up into a tube. Use a sharp knife to slice the tube thinly across. With your hands, fluff up the basil to separate the shreds. (Alternatively, just tear the basil with your fingers.)6 Finish and serve: Sprinkle the hot pizzas with a pinch of salt and basil.

"Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and salt for 20 seconds, set aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, blend together granulated sugar, brown sugar and vegetable oil until combined. Mix in egg and vanilla then blend in pumpkin puree. With mixer on low speed, slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed (batter will be pretty wet). With a rubber spatula, fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough 2 Tbsp (either using a medium cookie dough scoop or using two spoons) at a time onto baking sheets lined with Silcone liners or parchment paper, spacing cookies two inches apart. Bake in preheated oven about 12 minutes until cookies are nearly set (you don't want to pull them out before they are done or they'll taste raw, not a cookie you want to under-bake. The top layer of the cookie should be cooked through). Allow to cool several minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Store in a single layer in an airtight container (these are best once they've rested in an airtight container a few hours, they soften throughout).Recipe Source: adapted slightly from allrecipes.com", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-cookies-676174", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Corner Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Raspberry-Big-Crumb-Coffee-Cake-555510.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 555510, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Raspberry Big Crumb Coffee Cake", "creditText": "The Corner Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup packed brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1230, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2010, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 egg", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 egg yolk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 3/4 cups flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.75, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup raspberry jam (or any other flavor you fancy)", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "raspberry jam", "metaInformation": ["or any other flavor you fancy)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raspberry-jam.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10719297, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "melted", "(1 1/4 sticks)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 10.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 20.0, "sourceUrl": "http://thecornerkitchenblog.com/raspberry-big-crumb-coffee-cake/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 19, "aggregateLikes": 55, "instructions": "In a medium bowl, mix together flour, sugars, cinnamon & salt.

Using foil overhang as aid, lift cookielayer from pan and place on work surface.Place sheet of plastic wrap lengthwise in same pan, leaving overhang on both short sides of pan. Place another sheet of plastic wrap crosswise in pan, leaving overhang on long sides of pan. Cut cookie layer in half crosswise. Return 1 cookie half, top side down, to pan, placing snugly in 1 short end of pan. Slightly soften ice cream in microwave in 15-second intervals. Spread ice cream evenly over cookie in pan. Place second cookie half, top side up, atop ice cream, pressing slightly to adhere. Fold plastic wrap up and over ice cream-filled cookie. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.                                                                Line baking sheet with parchment paper or waxed paper. Unwrap ice cream-filled cookie; place on work surface. Using serrated knife, cut cookie lengthwise in half, then cut each strip crosswise into 4 sandwiches. Place on sheet; freeze.                                                                Stir chocolate and oil in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water until melted and smooth; cool to lukewarm. Arrange decorations on plates. Working with 1 ice cream sandwich at a time, dip half of sandwich in melted chocolate, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into bowl. Press sandwich gently into decorations on plate. Return to sheet in freezer. Freeze until chocolate sets and freezes, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Wrap each sandwich individually in foil and keep frozen.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-dipped-ice-cream-sandwiches-236308", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,

Pulse the apricots until finely chopped. Return the pistachios to the food processor along with the honey, orange zest and juice, and almond extract; pulse to combine. Refrigerate.Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. On a floured surface, cut the dough lengthwise into four 1 1/4-inch-wide strips. Roll 1 strip into a 3-by-18-inch rectangle. Spoon 1/3 cup of the pistachio mixture down the length. Starting from a long side, roll into a log to enclose the filling. Pinch the seam to seal; arrange seam-side down. Cut into 2-inch pieces and put on a baking sheet; refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.Make 1/2-inch-long cuts on the cut ends of each piece of dough; pull apart to form an X. Arrange 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Beat the remaining egg and brush on the cookies. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are light golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes; transfer to racks to cool completely.
