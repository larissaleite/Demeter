Add to the butter-and-egg mixture in 2 additions, and mix only until combined.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Fold the hazelnuts and chocolate chips into the dough, and mix until evenly distributed. The dough will be thick and hard to stir. If it is too sticky, chill briefly.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, about 454 grams/16 ounces each. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into a log about 2 inches wide by 14 inches long by 1 1/2 inches high. Place the logs on the prepared sheet pan with several inches between them.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            In a small bowl, mix 1 egg with 1 teaspoon of water to make an egg wash. Brush each log with egg wash, coating them evenly on the top and sides.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Bake for 27 minutes, rotating the cookie sheet from front to back halfway through baking, until very lightly browned and somewhat firm. Remove from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 300\u00baF.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Cool the logs for 20 minutes, then place them on a cutting board. With a serrated knife, slice each log on a slight angle into 3/4-inch-thick pieces, keeping them in a row. Slide the row of biscotti together, lift and place back on the cookie sheet, then separate the slices, leave 1/2 inch of space between each one.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Bake again for 9 to 12 minutes, rotating once during

If the dressing is too thick for your liking, add water \u00bd a Tbsp at a time until the desired consistency is reached.Drizzle the salads with the Ranch Greek yogurt dressing.Devour!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cobb-salad-low-carb-low-calorie-low-fat-high-protein-509592", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "salad", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 20, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Creamed-Chicken-over-Biscuits-468842.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 468842, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Creamed Chicken over Biscuits", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 195.47, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "4 warm buttermilk biscuits", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "buttermilk biscuits", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk-biscuits.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 18009, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup diced carrot", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrot", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11124, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2-1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken bouillon granules", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bouillon-cube.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1006080, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 cup 2% milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["2%"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "peas", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "thawed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11304, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/8 teaspoon pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup cubed peeled potato", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potato", "metaInformation": ["cubed", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11362, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked and cubed", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breasts", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless", "cubed", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1055062, "unit": "pound"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 89.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/creamed-chicken-over-biscuits", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}], "step": "Place potato and carrot in a small saucepan.

In a large bowl, combine spinach, feta, mint, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, eggs, garlic, lemon juice and zest, pepper and salt. Mix well.2. Assemble the triangles: Unroll the phyllo and lay it flat on a clean, dry surface. Cover completely with plastic wrap. Working with one sheet of phyllo at a time, and keeping the rest covered with the plastic wrap to keep it from drying out, place a sheet vertically in front of you. Brush the phyllo with butter and cover with another sheet. Butter the top sheet and cut the phyllo lengthwise in half into two equal 3-inch-wide strips. If two strips seem like they will produce triangles that are too large, cut them into three equal, vertical strips instead.  Spoon 2 teaspoons of filling at the top end of each strip as shown in the photo above. Fold up the phyllo strips as you would a flag to create a neat triangle, being careful not to roll too tightly or the triangles will crack when baked.3. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with plastic. Repeat with the rest of the phyllo and filling. You can bake the triangles immediately or freeze and bake them later.4. If freezing: Freeze uncooked triangles on the baking sheet. When frozen, transfer them to an airtight container, setting parchment or plastic wrap between layers if needed. Store in the freezer, where they\u2019ll keep for about a month.5. To bake: If frozen, do not thaw the triangles before baking. Position racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter two sheet pans. Arrange phyllo triangles on prepared baking sheets in a single layer. Brush tops of the triangles with butter and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes for fresh triangles and 20 to 25 minutes for frozen triangles, switching the positions of the pans halfway through
