The consistency of the sauce should be thick, but if you desire a thinner consistency, simply add water.For the Salad:Preheat the oven to 350F.Sprinkle the chicken breast with salt and chili powder. Place it in a lightly oiled baking dish and bake for 30 minutes or until cooked all the way through. Remove from the oven, chop the chicken and set aside.Wash the Brussels sprouts, chop off all of the hard stems and remove the leaves that fall off easily.Slice Brussels sprouts from tip-to-tail (not length-wise). Stop slicing once you get to the hard white core. You can either discard the core or chop it finely.Place shaved Brussels in a large salad bowl. Using your hands, break apart any slices of sprouts that are stuck together (this can usually be achieved by simply tossing the shaved Brussels sprouts).Wash the dino kale leaves and pat them dry. Slice them thinly and add them to the bowl with the shaved Brussels sprouts along with the chopped cilantro and diced mango.In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, grated ginger, garlic and salt.Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to be sure everything is coated.Serve salad with chopped chicken and desired amount of Thai peanut sauce on top.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/thai-chopped-chicken-salad-612494", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 40, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Two Peas and Their Pod", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Vegan-Coconut-Raspberry-Ice-Cream-547972.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 547972, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Vegan Coconut Raspberry Ice Cream", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 351.54, "creditText": "Two Peas and Their Pod", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 (13.66 oz) cans chilled Thai coconut milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "coconut milk", "metaInformation": ["chilled", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 27.32, "id": 12118, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup raspberries (fresh or frozen)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "raspberries", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raspberries.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9302, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoon"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 85.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/vegan-coconut-raspberry-ice-cream/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 60, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ice-cream-machine.jpg", "id": 404791, "name": "ice cream machine"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png", "id": 404726, "name": "blender"}], "step": "Place the coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla in a blender.

Mix on low until incorporated, about 30 seconds.In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks, egg whites, milk, oil, water, and vanilla. Add the liquids to the dry ingredients in 3 stages, scraping down at each addition and beating for about 30 seconds.Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full and bake until baked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool completely.Fill a piping bag with the slightly chilled Chocolate Ganache. Cut the tip of the bag off and insert the tip into the center of a cooled cupcake. Squeeze to allow a small amount of mixture into the center. Release and remove the bag from the cupcake. Repeat on the other cupcakes. Generously frost the top of each cupcake with Peanut Butter Cream Frosting. Drizzle with remaining Chocolate Ganache.
