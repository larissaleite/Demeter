Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Arrange the short ribs on a large sheet of foil. Sprinkle all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.Bring the New Mexico chiles, ancho chiles and 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the chiles are just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender. Holding the top on firmly, blend until the chile puree is smooth.Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the short ribs in batches and brown on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes per batch, transferring the short ribs to a bowl each time.Add the garlic and red onions to the drippings in the pot. Saute until the onions soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in the cumin and oregano. Add the chile puree from the blender, the broth, agave, and espresso; stir to blend. Return the short ribs and any juices from the bowl to the pot; stir to coat. Bring to a simmer. Cover and place the pot in the oven. Braise until the ribs are very tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes.Tilt the pot. Spoon off and discard any fat that rises to the surface and pools at the lower end. Using tongs, transfer the ribs and any loose bones to a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully cut the membrane off each piece of meat (try to cut away only the membrane and not any meat). Discard the membranes and all bones. Cut the meat into small (scant 1/2-inch) cubes. Return the meat to the sauce in the pot. Mix in the black beans. Season the chili with about 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. If desired, add the adobo sauce by teaspoonfuls to increase the spiciness. Transfer the chili to a large bowl. Sprinkle with the green onions.Spoon the Creamy Corn Polenta into deep bowls. Ladle chili over. Sprinkle generously with chocolate. Serve with the garnishes.Espresso coffee and bittersweet chocolate are surprises here but they contribute the nuanced flavors of a Mexican mole. Warm corn tortillas are wonderful to serve alongside. And leftovers make great soft tacos.                                                Creamy Corn Polenta:                                        Bring the broth, 2 1/2 cups water, butter and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a heavy, large saucepan over high heat. Gradually whisk in the polenta. Continue to whisk until the polenta begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the polenta is very thick and tender, stirring often with a flat-bottom spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to prevent sticking or burning, about 20 minutes. Blend the corn in a mini processor until a coarse puree forms. Stir the corn puree into the polenta. Season with more salt if desired.

"instructions": "To prepare doughnuts, combine the warm milk and sugar in a small bowl. Stir in yeast, and let sit for 5 minutes or until foamy.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and melted butter and set aside.Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the milk mixture and mix on low speed until flour is moistened, then increase the speed until dough comes together. Add egg mixture and mix on medium-high speed for approximately 10 minutes until dough is smooth and very stretchy, scraping down the bowl as needed. When it is done, the dough should make a slapping sound against the edge of the bowl. Transfer dough to a lightly-oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator overnight.The next day, line two sheet pans with lightly-oiled parchment paper or silicone mats.Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently roll the dough to a uniform 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out rounds using circle or doughnut cutters; arrange on the prepared tray, leaving room for them to expand. Place them in the warm place for about 1 hour or until they puffed. (Tip: if your kitchen is on the cold side, turn on your oven for 30 seconds, then turn it off, and place your sheet pans inside. The residual heat will create the perfect proofing environment)Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with oil to a depth of at least 1 1/2 inches. Heat over medium heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F. Continue to monitor the temperature throughout the cooking process, adjusting heat as necessary. Line another sheet pan with paper towels, and set a metal cooling rack inside.Gently lay the doughnuts in the hot oil, one at a time. Fry the doughnuts in batches of 2 or 3 (depending on the size of your pot) for 1 to 2 minutes per side, then flip and cook until evenly golden brown (they will get darker when you take them out of the oil). Transfer with tongs or a slotted spoon to prepared rack to cool. Repeat with remaining doughnuts.To prepare glaze, sift powdered sugar (and cocoa powder if making chocolate version) into a bowl to remove any large clumps. Add moonshine and vanilla extract (for vanilla variation), along with 1 tablespoon water, and whisk until no dry sugar remains. Add additional water as needed, 1 teaspoon at a time, until glaze reaches desired consistency. The glaze should flow thickly off your whisk and melt back into itself in 2 to 3 seconds.Dip tops of doughnuts, one at a time, into glaze. Invert and arrange on cooling rack until glaze sets. Repeat with remaining doughnuts.

the taco seasoning: Mix all of the ingredients with 1 tablespoon each salt and black pepper in a bowl. Prepare the pizza: Mix 2 tablespoons of the taco seasoning and the canola oil in a shallow bowl. Pound the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to 1/4 inch thick. Add the chicken to the bowl, turning to coat, and marinate 30 minutes.  Preheat a grill to medium high. Grill the chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Let cool, then cut into bite-size pieces.Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Roll out each on a floured surface into an 8-inch round. Brush with canola oil, sprinkle with taco seasoning and grill until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side; remove from the grill.Mix the cheeses in a bowl, then sprinkle on the crusts and top with the chicken. Return the pizzas to the grill, and cook until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the avocado, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, red onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Top the pizzas with the avocado mixture, salsa, sour cream and cilantro.

Combine 1 cup of the cream with the sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan and drop in the vanilla pod. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 cup of cream, the milk and the vanilla.Cover and refrigerate until the mixture is well chilled.While the ice cream chills make the cinnamon rolls. *This recipe makes six extra rolls, you may half the recipe if desired.Add the yeast, water and 1 teaspoon sugar to a small bowl. Allow the yeast to activate and puff up, this should take 5 to 10 minutes.Mix the milk, brown sugar and butter in a large bowl and mix in the yeast mixture. Add 2 cups of flour and mix until a dough forms, then cover and let rise for at least one hour.After an hour, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour, baking soda and baking powder and mix. I use my hands to make sure the dough completely comes together. Add the cinnamon and brown sugar to a small bowl. In another bowl mix the butter and vanilla together. Grease a 9x13 inch pyrex dish.Flour your workspace and roll the dough with a rolling pin until its thin and somewhat rectangular, then brush with melted butter (you may not use it all) and generously cover with cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the dough.Starting with the end away from you, roll the dough into a line towards you. Slice the rolls about 1 inch thick and lay in the prepared pan. Cover and let the rolls rise for about 30 minutes.Bake at 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes. Allow to cool completely and then chop half of the cinnamon rolls on the pan into bite size pieces. Eat or save the other half for snacking!When the ice cream is chilled remove the vanilla bean and churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions. In the last five minutes slowly add the cubed cinnamon rolls. Transfer to a freezer safe container, cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 to 6 hours.Before you serve the ice cream make the brown butter sauce. Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat and add butter. Whisk constantly until melted, then continue to whisk as bubbles form, the butter begins to foam, and eventually brown bits appear in the bottom of the pan. This will take about 5-6 minutes total. As soon as the brown bits appear, remove from heat. Stir in the already separated vanilla beans. Let cool for 5 minutes.After 5 minutes add the powdered sugar, heavy cream and vanilla. Whisk until a glaze forms. Transfer to a small bowl and serve over the the ice cream.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-chip-stuffed-cinnamon-roll-ice-cream-with-vanilla-bean-brown-butter-sauce-549509", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 720, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Comfy in the Kitchen", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Peppermint-Bark-588091.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 588091, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peppermint Bark", "preparationMinutes": 30, "creditText": "Comfy in the Kitchen", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 boxes of candy canes", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "candy canes", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/candy-canes.jpg", "unitLong": "boxes", "unitShort": "boxes", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93759, "unit": "boxes"}, {"originalString": "24 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semi sweet chocolate chips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 10019903, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "24 oz of white chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "white chocolate chips", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 24.0, "id": 10019087, "unit": "oz"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 36.0, "sourceUrl": "http://comfyinthekitchen.com/2011/12/peppermint-bark-2/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 29, "aggregateLikes": 438, "instructions": "In a microwave safe bowl melt semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave for 60 seconds, stir and repeat for an additional 60 seconds.Place parchment paper on top of a cookie sheet and spread melted chocolate over top.Place in refrigerator until set and hardened (appx 20 mins).Melt white chocolate chips the same way.Unwrap candy canes and place in a large Ziploc bag and crush with a mallet.Place 1 cup of crushed candy canes into the melted white chocolate.Pour white chocolate on top of hardened dark chocolate and sprinkle with the left over crushed candy cane.Place in refrigerator for 2 hours until well set and hardened.Take out and break into pieces.

Prepare roll mix according to package directions. Turn the dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.

On a floured surface, roll out each piece into a 5-in. circle. Top each with 1 tablespoon of bacon filling. Fold dough around filling, shaping each piece into a small loaf; pinch edges to seal. Place seam side down on greased baking sheets. Cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with cooking spray. Let rise in a warm place for 20-30 minutes.                                                                                           Brush egg over buns. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.                                        Yield: 1-1/2 dozen.

Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard the skin, and dice the chicken in large bite-size pieces.Meanwhile, add the broccoli florets to a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook for 1 minute, until crisp tender, drain, and place into a bowl of ice water until cool. This will stop the cooking and set the bright green color.For the dressing, whisk together the mayonnaise, wine, mustards, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add enough sauce to the warm chicken to moisten well. Add the tarragon, broccoli, and tomatoes and mix gently to combine. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Line a\u00a0Non-Stick 12-Cup Regular Muffin Pan\u00a0with paper liners; set aside. You will likely have batter for a 13th or 14th cupcake, and I baked it in a cooking-sprayed\u00a0mini loaf pan\u00a0because my oven is small and that pan setup fits; discard extra batter if that's easier. Cucpakes\u00a0- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the first 8 ingredients, through vanilla, until smooth. Add the flour, baking soda, optional salt, and whisk until just combined; don't overmix. Using a 2-inch\u00a0cookie scoop, place\u00a0about 2 heaping tablespoons of batter per cupcake into each of the 12 cavities so they're solidly 3/4-full. I poured the excess batter into the\u00a0mini loaf pan. Bake cupcakes for about 18 to 19 minutes (I baked the mini loaf for 23 minutes), or until domed, set, pale golden, springy to the touch, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter; don't overbake. Allow cupcakes to cool in pan for about 15 minutes before removing. While cupcakes cool, make the frosting. Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting\u00a0- Combine first 3 ingredients in a large mixing bowl, add about 1 cup confectioners' sugar, and whisk to combine or beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Continue adding sugar until desired frosting consistency is reached. Because I used light cream cheese, the frosting stayed on the runnier side. If you want frosting thick enough to pipe, do not use light cream cheese. If you like your frosting really piled on thick and high, make a double batch. With a spoon, add 2 to 3 tablespoons frosting to the top of each cupcake and smooth with the back of the spoon if necessary. My frosting just ran naturally (from the light cream cheese). Optionally transfer frosting to a\u00a0piping bag\u00a0and frost the cooled cupcakes. I like the\u00a0Wilton 1M tip\u00a0 for cupcakes. You may have a small amount of frosting left over. It will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Optionally, garnish each cupcake with a pinch of lemon zest. Cupcakes will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days. I personally am comfortable storing cream cheese-frosted items at room temp, but if you prefer to store in the fridge, that's fine, but note the fridge will dry cupcakes out much more quickly.

Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary.Serve the chops topped with the sauce and garnished with fresh parsley.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/slow-cooked-peach-barbecue-smothered-pork-chops-603579", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 2, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Homemade-Animal-Crackers-205719.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 205719, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Homemade Animal Crackers", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/8 teaspoon baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 18372, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 ounces egg whites", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1124, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "nutmeg", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2025, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/4 ounce powdered milk", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "powdered milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk-powdered.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1090, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 ounces sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 19335, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "3 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1/2 ounce vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "ounce"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 4.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/12/bravetart-homemade-animal-crackers-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 96, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Make the cookie dough:Using a sieve to sift the flour. Set aside.Using a hand or stand mixer (fitted with a paddle attachment) cream together the butter and sugar, along with the powdered milk, nutmeg, salt and baking soda, on medium speed. Not until light and fluffy, but only until well combined. About a minute. Scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula and cream a minute more.Set the mixer to low. Drizzle in the vanilla. With the mixer still running, add half the flour and mix until just incorporated. Then add half the egg whites. Repeat with the remaining flour and egg whites. Mix until homogenous, then shut off the mixer.Use a rubber spatula to scrape the cookie dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap. Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight, before rolling.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Cut and bake the cookies:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 and have 2 parchment lined sheet pans standing by. On a well floured surface, roll the cookies to just a little over 1/4\" thickness (3/8\" if you like to be precise). Run a metal spatula between the dough and the rolling surface, to ensure the dough isn't sticking in any places. Cut the dough with your desired cutters and transfer the cut-outs to the cookie sheet. They won't spread significantly in the oven, so they can be placed fairly close together. If you like, dock the cookies twice with the tip of a clicky pen (clicked to the retracted position) to mimic the large, deep dock marks on the originals. You can gather, knead and re-roll the scraps three times; the dough is very forgiving.Bake the cookies for approximately 12 minutes, or until quite firm to the touch and just beginning to brown. Cool thoroughly. Store in an airtight container at room temperatures for up to a month.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-animal-crackers-205719", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 240, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
