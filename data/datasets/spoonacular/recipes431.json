You can put the bell pepper under a broiler in a broiler pan and broil on all sides until the skin is completely blackened.

(Alternatively you can grill the eggplant, in which case, prepare the grill for medium high direct heat.)Slice the eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the cut side of the eggplants in a crosshatch pattern with a sharp knife, in lines about an inch apart. Poke the skin sides of the eggplants with the tines of a fork all over.Line a sheet pan with foil. Spread olive oil over the bottom of the sheet pan, and sprinkle evenly with salt. Place the eggplants cut side down on the foil lined pan. Place in oven and cook for 35 minutes, or until completely cooked through and very soft. If grilling, cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, and poke the skin sides with the tines of a fork. Brush the cut side with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Grill cut side down until lightly browned and cooked all the way through. If the eggplants brown too quickly, turn them over and finish the cooking on the skin side.Once the eggplants have cooled to the touch, peel off the tough outer skin and discard.2While the eggplant is roasting in step 1,roast the red bell pepper. There are three ways in which you can do this. Coat the bell pepper lightly with olive oil first. You can put the bell pepper under a broiler in a broiler pan and broil on all sides until the skin is completely blackened. OR you can place the bell pepper directly on the grates of a gas stove and roast over the open flame, until blackened on all sides. OR you can grill on high direct heat, turning, until blackened on all sides.Once blackened, place the bell pepper in a bowl and cover with a plate to steam for several minutes. Once the bell pepper has cooled to the touch, peel off the charred outer skin. Remove the stem and seeds.3 Place garlic, peeled eggplant, peeled roasted bell pepper in a food processor and pulse until smooth. 4 Transfer the eggplant mixture from the food processor into a large bowl.

You can also test if it's ready using the tip of wooden chopsticks or a wooden spoon.Remove biscuits from tube and lay out on a cutting board. Using a 1 inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out a hole from the middle of each biscuit.Line a cookie wire rack with a few sheets of paper towels to absorb the oil.Gently place a couple of the doughnuts at a time into the hot oil. When they start to rise and turn golden, flip them over immediately using tongs or a wooden spoon (it should take less than a minute).The second side will turn golden very quickly and faster than the first side.Immediately transfer the fully fried donuts to paper towels to blot excess oil.Continue with the remaining donuts until everything is fried. You can also fry the donut holes.Make the glaze - In a medium bowl whisk together powdered sugar, peanut butter, and salt. Add 1 tablespoon of milk and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Mixture may be thick. Add more milk, a tablespoon at a time, until the glaze is thick and just pourable.Dip each donut into the peanut butter glaze. Shake off some of the excess glaze. Return to the wire rack to dry. Repeat and dunk again for a thicker coating. Add sprinkles if desired. Allow to rest for a few minutes for the frosting to harden slightly.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/easy-homemade-fried-donuts-with-chocolate-peanut-butter-glaze-680318",
