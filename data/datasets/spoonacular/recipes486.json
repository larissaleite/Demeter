Reroll the scraps once and cut out more cookies. Arrange about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm but not browned, 17 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cookie                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/s/sugar-cookie-recipes.html\">Cookie</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/green-tea-cookies-743516", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 210, "servings": 36, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "The Lemon Bowl", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/5-ingredient-sesame-ginger-green-beans-779510.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 779510, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "5-Ingredient Sesame Ginger Green Beans", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 86.26, "creditText": "The Lemon Bowl", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "toasted almond slices -
