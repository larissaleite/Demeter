Taste, and season with additional salt and pepper, as necessary.Stir in the eggs and cornmeal.Form the mixture into patties.  Place on a plate or baking sheet and refrigerate for t least 30 minutes (this helps the patties stay together during cooking).Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add patties to the pan, without crowding & working in batches if necessary, and cook 7-10 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.  Flip and cook another 7-10 minutes on the other side.Add crumbled feta to a food processor and pulse until small crumbs remain.  Add in cream cheese and puree for 4-5  minutes, scraping down the sides when necessary, until feta is super creamy.Place burgers on your favorite buns.

It should extend to the top of the pan but you don't have to crimp the edges or anything - we're going for rustic. Refrigerate until you're ready to add the apples.Next prep the apples. Add them to the same bowl as you made the dough in and toss with sugar, cinnamon and flour. Add to pie crust and top with 1 Tbsp butter, scored into little dots or strips.Next prep the topping. In the same bowl mix, add the crumble topping ingredients and mix with fingers or a pastry cutter until crumbly. Then pour it over the pie, spreading it evenly to coat. Bake at 400 for 35-45 minutes, or until the pie is warm and bubbly and the top is golden brown. If you notice the crumble top getting too brown, simply top it with foil.Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/deep-dish-apple-crumble-pie-500393",

For the red pepper corned beef hash: In a medium saute pan, add the oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers and thyme, season with salt and pepper and cook until softened, about 15 minutes. Add the corned beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.For the tempura poached egg: Fill a high-sided pan halfway with canola oil and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Mix the flour, seltzer and egg yolk together in a bowl. Mix in some salt and pepper and set aside.Preheat the broiler.Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer and add the vinegar. Crack each egg into a separate small bowl, turn off the heat under the saucepan and immediately slide each individual egg into the water, allowing the whites to congeal around the yolks. Cover for 3 minutes, then remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, letting the water drain off. Dip the eggs directly in the batter, and then transfer them immediately to the hot oil. Fry the eggs for 30 seconds; remove to a plate.To serve, sprinkle your English muffin halves with some Cheddar and place under the broiler until melted. Cover each melty side with some of the hash and put an egg on top. Not too much more to say except, knife and fork!

"instructions": "To prepare crust: Whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Using your fingers, quickly rub the butter pieces into the dry ingredients until smaller but still visible. Add sour cream and oil; toss with a fork to combine with the dry ingredients. Sprinkle 1/4 cup water over the mixture. Toss with a fork until evenly moist. Knead the dough in the bowl a few timesthe mixture may still be a little crumbly. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead a few more times, until the dough just holds together. Divide the dough in half and shape into two 5-inch disks. Wrap each in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.To prepare filling: Just before youre ready to roll out the dough, process tapioca in a clean spice grinder, mini food processor or blender until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and add cherries, honey, lemon juice, cloves (if using) and salt; toss well to combine. Set aside.Position a rack in the center of the oven and place a foil-lined baking sheet on the rack below; preheat to 425F.Remove the dough from the refrigerator; let stand for 10 minutes to warm slightly. Roll one portion between sheets of parchment or wax paper into a 12-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet and invert the dough into a 9-inch pie pan. Peel off the remaining paper. Moisten the outer edge of the dough with water. Scrape the filling into the crust. (If youre using frozen, thawed cherries, leave any excess liquid behind in the bowl.)To prepare lattice top: Roll the remaining dough between sheets of parchment or wax paper into a 12-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet. Cut the dough into 1-inch strips using a pastry wheel or a knife. Lift off every other strip and lay them on top of the pie, leaving about a 1-inch gap between strips. Use the shorter strips for the edges and the longer ones for the middle of the pie. (You may not need to use the outermost strips.) Fold back the first, third and fifth strips of dough to the edge of the pie. Place a shorter strip of dough across the second and fourth strips, about 1 inch from the edge. Unfold the folded strips over the crosswise strip. Fold back the second and fourth strips over the first crosswise strip. Place another strip crosswise, about 1 inch from the first. Unfold the strips over the second crosswise strip. Continue folding back alternating strips and placing crosswise strips until the top is covered with woven strips. Trim any overhanging crust. Crimp the outer edge with a fork. Brush just the lattice top (not the outer edge) with the egg white-honey mixture.Bake the pie for 20 minutes. Then rotate it 180 degrees and reduce the oven temperature to 325. Continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is beginning to bubble, 40 to 50 minutes more. Check the crust toward the end; if its looking too dark, tent the top and edges with foil to prevent overbrowning. Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/honey-sweetened-cherry-pie-696198", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 300, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Jans Sushi Bar", "cuisines": ["mexican"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mango-Avocado-Salsa-476755.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 476755, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Mango-Avocado Salsa", "creditText": "Jans Sushi Bar", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 avocado, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "avocado", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9037, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cilantro", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11165, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "jalapeno pepper", "metaInformation": ["seeded", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11979, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "the juice of 1/2 lime", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "juice of lime", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9160, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 mango, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "mango", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mango.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9176, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup diced red onion", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10011282, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 63.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.janssushibar.com/mango-avocado-salsa/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "aggregateLikes": 215, "instructions": "Lightly toss the mango, avocado, onion, jalapeno, cilantro and lime juice together in a medium bowl.

Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft. Add sesame oil, cool for at least 15 minutes, and strain. Fold in the minced shrimp.Fill and roll the egg roll wrappers, using 1 tablespoon of filling for each roll. Working with 1 wonton wrapper at a time, place the wrapper with one corner of the diamond closest to you. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Roll the corner closest to you over the filling. Brush the top corner with water. Fold in the sides of the wonton and continue rolling the egg roll up until it is closed. Press to seal, set aside, and continue with the remaining ingredients.In a skillet set over moderately high heat, heat the remaining oil and saute the egg rolls until golden brown on all sides, using tongs to turn them. Serve when cool enough to eat, with dipping sauce.                                                Dipping Sauce:                                        Combine all ingredients in a bowl.Wine Suggestion: Beringer White Zinfandel                                                    Recipe courtesy of

Cover and let rest in refrigerator for at least 2 days.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            For the Mint Syrup: Combine sugar and water in small saucepan.

Chill syrup thoroughly before using.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the Pickled Rind: Peel the green skin from the outside of the melon rinds. Trim any remaining flesh from the inside or overly tough rind from the outside. Slice remaining rind into 1/4-inch planks. Cut into small decorative shapes with a cookie cutter or knife. Combine water, vinegar, Kool-aid, and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add watermelon and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain rind out into a heat proof container and continue simmering liquid until it reduces by about a third, around ten minutes. Pour reduced liquid over rind and allow to cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 24 hours.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For the Spoom: Combine watermelon pur\u00e9e and water. Using a stand mixer or electric handheld mixer, whip egg whites with salt on medium-high speed until foamy, then add sugar and whip on high speed until it forms glossy, firm peaks. Pour watermelon pur\u00e9e into meringue and fold with a whisk. Don't panic when it doesn't incorporate like most meringue-based treats, just keep mixing. Eventually you'll have a light pink, slightly fluffy thick liquid. Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow to firm up in the freezer in a sealed container for at least 4 hours before scooping.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            To Make a Drink: For a 10 ounce glass, mix together 1/4 cup shrub and 1 tablespoon mint syrup. Fill glass with ice and pour in shrub mixture, then top with still or sparkling water. Add a few pieces of pickled watermelon rind and stir gently with a straw.

Stir in granulated sugar.Whisk together egg whites, buttermilk, molasses and oil in a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the egg white mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula just until blended.Pour into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 375 for 15-25 min., or until a cake tester comes out clean. Set aside to cool.Whisk together  cup milk, egg yolks and cornstarch in a large bowl. Heat remaining milk in a heavy saucepan until steaming.Gradually whisk milk into the egg mixture. Return to the saucepan; cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the custard boils and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in vanilla and about 3 drops yellow food coloring, if using.Transfer to a clean bowl and place a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and water in a heatproof mixing bowl large enough to fit over the saucepan. Set the bowl over the barely simmering water and beat with an electric mixer at low speed, moving the beaters around the bowl constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 140F. (This will take 3 to 5 minutes.) Increase the mixer speed to high and continue beating over the heat for a full 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and beat the meringue until cool, about 4 minutes.Whisk one-fourth of the meringue into the custard. Add the remaining whites and use a whisk to incorporate them with a folding motion.Peel and de-seed 3 red pears. Cut into slices or chunks, and dip in citrus juice or fruit saver. (I also used some fresh raspberries in the trifle pictured, but I think it would be better with just the pears.)Cut the cake into 1 inch by 2 inch strips. Place a layer of cake in the bottom of a bowl. Sprinkle the fruit on top. Add a layer of custard. Repeat until bowl is full, ending with custard and a little reserved fruit garnish.

After pies have chilled, remove the paper liners and place a popsicle stick in the center of each pie. Return pies to a cookie sheet and freeze for at least another 3-4 hours. Once pies are thoroughly frozen, dip them in melting chocolate. You can use store bough melting chocolate or make your own.For the dipping chocolate: In a small deep bowl, melt the chocolate chips and oil in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between until melted. Dip the pies in the chocolate completely covering the pie. I found it easier to use a spoon and kind of drizzle it over the pies.

Add the chicken; cover and refrigerate to marinate for 4 to 6 hours.Prepare a charcoal fire using about 6 pounds of charcoal and burn until the coals are completely covered with a thin coating of light gray ash, 20 to 30 minutes. Spread the coals evenly over the grill bottom, position the grill rack above the coals and heat until medium hot (when you can hold your hand 5 inches above the grill surface for no longer than 3 or 4 seconds). Or, for a gas grill, turn on all burners to high, close the lid and heat until very hot, 10 to 15 minutes.For the basting liquid: Whisk together 1/2 cup water, the vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Set aside.Drain the chicken well and pat dry; sprinkle with pepper. Apply some oil to the grill grate. Place the chicken on the grill, leaving plenty of space between each piece. Grill until seared, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium or move the chicken to a cooler part of the grill. Continue to grill, turning occasionally and brushing with the basting liquid, until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the pieces from the grill as they cook and transfer to a warm platter. Serve immediately!

combine the butter, sugar, egg, and beat on medium-high speed until well-creamed, light and fluffy, about 5 minutes (or use a hand mixer and beat for at least 7 minutes). Do not shortcut the creaming process; make sure dough is very light in color and fluffy, stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the honey, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until combined and smooth, about 2 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, optional salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Using a medium 2-inch\u00a0cookie scoop, form heaping two tablespoon mounds (I made 17). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds very slightly with your palm, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter. Preheat oven to 350F, line baking sheets with\u00a0Silpats, or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheets, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet). Bake for 8 to 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. Do not bake longer than 9 minutes for soft cookies because they firm up as they cool; bake for 9-10 minutes if you like firmer cookies (The cookies shown in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled overnight, allowed to come to room temp for 10 minutes while oven preheated, and were baked for 8 minutes).

Crush about one-quarter of them and slice the rest into the crushed berries. Toss with sugar to taste--a tablespoon or so per basket--and chill until serving time. The strawberry mixture should be very juicy.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            When you're ready to make the biscuits, get the berries out of the refrigerator to come up to room temperature. Mix the flour, salt (unless you are using salted butter), baking powder, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture looks like cornmeal with a few larger pieces of butter in it. You can use a pastry blender, two knives, or quick rubbing fingers. (I use two knives and then fingers, and honestly, it never looks like cornmeal. It is very dry. This is okay.) Stir in 3/4 cup cream, just until most of the dry mixture has been moistened; it will still be quite dry. Turn out on a board and knead just a few times, until the dough just comes together. It might still be a little crumbly at the edges. Roll or pat 1/2 inch thick and cut into squares or circles or whatever shape you like. This recipe will make 12 individual shortcakes. You can use cookie cutters, but then you'll have scraps--I prefer simply to carve up the patted-out dough into 12 pieces.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Put the shortcakes on an unbuttered baking sheet. If you used cookie cutters, lightly knead together any scraps and roll again and cut. Brush the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons cream. I like to sprinkle them with a little turbinado sugar at this point, too, but it isn't necessary. Bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned and the dough is set. Cool on a rack and serve while warm. Make the whipped cream while the biscuits cool a bit.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            To serve: Warm the shortcakes if necessary, split them, and spoon berries liberally over the bottom halves.

Pour the hot chocolate into mugs and top with a tablespoon or two of the marshmallow cream. The marshmallow is super thick and rich, so keep that in mind when it comes to adding your desired amount. Torch the frosting on top if desired.
