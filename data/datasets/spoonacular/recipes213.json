Stir in the baking soda. Gently add 3 of the pretzels and simmer for 2 minutes, turning them halfway through. Lift the pretzels with a slotted spoon or spatula and drain for a few moments over the pan, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Simmer the remaining pretzels in the same fashion.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Beat the egg yolk with the 11/2 teaspoons water in a small dish. Brush the pretzels with the yolk mixture and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pretzels to a wire rack to cool. Arrange the pretzels in a bowl or on a platter and serve. The pretzels will be at their best the day they are made. Should you have leftovers, they can be stored in an airtight container for a day or two, then warmed gently in the oven, wrapped in foil, to soften them up a bit.", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

The crumbs should still be slightly moist to the touch; they will dry and harden as they cool.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Let the crumbs cool completely before using in a recipe or scarfing by the handful. Stored in an airtight container, the crumbs will keep fresh for 1 week at room temperature or 1 month in the fridge or freezer.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            For the Confetti Cookies Combine the butter, sugar, and glucose in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs and vanilla, and beat for 7 to 8 minutes. \u00a0                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, milk powder, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and rainbow sprinkles. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute. (Do not walk away from the machine during this step, or you will risk overmixing the dough.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.\u00a0                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Still on low speed, add the birthday cake crumbs and mix in for 30 seconds\u2014just until they are incorporated.\u00a0                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3-cup measure), portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes flat. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. Do not bake your cookies from room temperature\u2014they will not bake properly.\u00a0                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\u00a0                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pans. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle, and spread. After 18 minutes, they should be very lightly browned on the edges (golden brown on the bottom). The centers will show just the beginning signs of color. Leave the cookies in the oven for an additional minute or so if the colors don\u2019t match and the cookies still seem pale and doughy on the surface.\u00a0                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage.
