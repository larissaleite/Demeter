If it is too thin, the cheesecake will not set up and will have more of a pudding consistency. I used Fage Total 2% Greek yogurt for mine, and it worked perfectly. But if your Greek yogurt is not thick -- for example, if you poke a spoon in it vertically and it falls over -- just strain it through a cheesecloth to remove the excess water. Then measure out 1 cup with the Greek yogurt that has been strained.(However, I should note that even if the cheesecake does not set up perfectly, it will still be delicious!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lighter-no-bake-cheesecake-526940", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cheap Recipe Blog", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Eggs-in-a-Bread-Bowl-483049.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 20, "id": 483049, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Eggs in a Bread Bowl", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 189.7, "creditText": "Cheap Recipe Blog", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "4 large dinner rolls (whole wheat, sourdough, crusty bread, etc.)", "aisle": "Bakery/Bread", "name": "dinner rolls", "metaInformation": ["whole wheat", "large", "(, sourdough, crusty bread, etc.)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-bread.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 18064, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Fine grain sea salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "fine grain sea salt", "metaInformation": ["fine"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons heavy cream or half-and-half", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup chopped vegetables and herbs (green onion, red pepper, green pepper, tomatoes, chives, etc.)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "herbs", "metaInformation": ["green", "red", "chopped", "( onion, pepper, pepper, tomatoes, chives, etc.)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1002044, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or parmesan)", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "shredded cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "(cheddar or parmesan)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1011026, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 65.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.cheaprecipeblog.com/2012/03/eggs-in-a-bread-bowl-recipe/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 350F.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Cut the tops off of dinner rolls and scoop out some of the bread from the center so there is enough room for an egg and toppings.
