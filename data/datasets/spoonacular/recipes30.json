Sear untouched for at least 3 minutes, up to 6 minutes for a 2-inch thick steak.4 Flip the steaks and cook for another 2-5 minutes, depending on how thick the steak is and how rare or well done you like your meat. You can use the finger test to test the doneness of your steak. Or you can use a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak (120\u00b0F to 125\u00b0F for rare, 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium rare, 140\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F for medium). Remove from the pan, loosely tent with foil and allow to rest while you make the sauce.5 Pour the wine into the pan and turn the heat to high. Boil this furiously until it is reduced by 3/4, about 10 minutes. Add any juices the steaks have released while resting. Turn off the heat and wait until the wine has stopped bubbling. When it has, add the tablespoons of butter, one tablespoon at a time. Swirl each tablespoon into the sauce until it is completely incorporated before adding the next tablespoon of butter. Add salt to taste and serve the sauce with the steak. Sprinkle freshly ground black pepper over the meat when you serve it.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/filet-mignon-with-red-wine-sauce-246468", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic":

"instructions": "For the dough:Food processor method: In a food processor, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Pulse to mix together. With the motor running, add the water and olive oil in a steady stream, and then pulse until the dough comes together in a rough mass, about 12 seconds. If the dough does not form into a ball, sprinkle with 1-2 teaspoons of water and pulse again until a ball forms. Let the dough rest for 5-10 minutes. Process again for 25-30 seconds, steadying the top of the food processor with one hand. The dough should be tacky to the touch but not sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball with your hands. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk and spongy, about 1 1/2 hours.Stand mixer method: Fit the mixer with the dough hook attachment and combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, yeast, and salt. Mix together. On low speed, add the water and olive oil in a steady stream and mix until the dough comes together in a rough mass. If the dough does not form into a ball, sprinkle with 1-2 teaspoons of water and mix again until a ball forms. Let the dough rest 5-10 minutes. Process again 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball with your hands. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk and spongy, about 1 1/2 hours.Once dough is risen, turn out onto a lightly floured work surface, punch it down, and shape into a smooth cylinder. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball, dusting with flour only if the dough becomes sticky. Cover both balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 10 minutes before proceeding.Place one ball of dough in a zip-top bag and freeze for up to 2 months for later use (when ready to use, thaw the frozen dough for 3-4 hours at room temperature). Reserve remaining ball of dough for calzones.Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F. Heat stone for 45-60 minutes.For the calzones:In a small nonstick frying pan set over medium-low heat, cook the sausage, breaking up into small pieces, until no longer pink, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Combine sausage, artichokes, 1/3 cup Parmesan, Fontina, and basil in a medium bowl.Beat egg and milk in a small bowl.Cover a work surface with two sheets of parchment paper. Divide the ball of dough in half and shape each half into a ball. Place each half of dough on its own parchment sheet. Roll out each ball of dough into a 7-inch round of even thickness.  Cover rounds with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 5 minutes.Season dough rounds lightly with salt and pepper. Spoon one-half of sausage-artichoke mixture onto one half of each dough round, leaving a 3/4-inch border uncovered. Don't mound the filling too high. Gently fold the uncovered half over the covered half to enclose the filling. Pinch the edges firmly with your fingers and crimp with the back of a fork. Repeat with second dough round. Brush the tops of calzones with egg-milk mixture. Sprinkle calzones with remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Cut a small steam vent in the top of each calzone. Using a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet, carefully slide the calzone-topped parchment paper onto the hot pizza stone. bake until golden, about 15 minutes.Use a pizza peel to remove calzone from oven and transfer to a cutting board.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and continue to simmer until it turns a deep golden brown (3 to 4 minutes- watch it closely and keep stirring every so often so it does not burn); remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.3.  Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.4.  In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the eggs and sugar.  Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Mix in the vanilla and browned butter, scraping the sides of the bowl to incorporate all of the ingredients, as needed.  Add the dry ingredients, pecans and toffee.  Mix just until combined.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.5.  Bake 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (don't over bake- start checking on it at 45 minutes... it should feel pretty firm in the center).

Stir fry for a few minutes or until the edges start to brown.Add the garlic, onion, chili, sesame seed oil, and enough soy sauce and honey to taste. How much soy sauce you will need depends on whether the pork had already been salted. My parboiled pork had been substantially seasoned so I added only about a tablespoonful of soy sauce. If making this dish with raw pork, you will need more than a tablespoonful.Cook over high heat until the pork has absorbed the seasonings. The mixture should be quite dry and the meat should have a caramelized look.To serve: Place a tablespoonful of rice on a lettuce leaf, top with a few pieces of pork, sprinkle with scallions and toasted sesame seeds, roll up and take a bite.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-to-cook-doejibulgogi-korean-spicy-stir-fried-pork-478572", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Dinner-Tonight--Chicken-Fried-Steak-with-Cream-Gravy-196659.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 196659, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Dinner Tonight: Chicken Fried Steak with Cream Gravy", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 teaspoon black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1230, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2031, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "3 eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 cups flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 1077, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": ["plus more for seasoning"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 pound top-round steak, cut into 4 even pieces", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "top round steak", "metaInformation": ["cut into 4 even pieces"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/round-steak.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.5, "id": 23636, "unit": "pound"}, {"originalString": "Vegetable oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "vegetable oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4513, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 91.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/08/chicken-fried-steak-with-cream-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 21, "aggregateLikes": 51, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                                                                                                                                                        2                                                                            In one large bowl mix together the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and the cayenne.

        Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.Cut fingerling potatoes into halves or quarters, depending on thickness of fingerlings -- thin, small fingerlings may also be left hole, larger potatoes should be quartered to speed cooking process. If you are using small red potatoes, halve or quarter them in the same way. Cover a large cookie sheet with foil. Place potatoes on cookie sheet. Combine with peppers and onions, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Coat the potatoes, peppers and onions with extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat vegetables in a thin layer, 2 to 3 tablespoons. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Place potatoes in the oven and roast 20 to 22 minutes, until potatoes are just tender and peppers and onions are crisp at edges. Toss mixture with tongs, turning the potatoes after 15 minutes. When the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a serving dish and peel the foil off the cookie sheet and discard for super-quick clean up!While potatoes cook, prepare chicken. Roll out a 2-foot piece of waxed paper or foil near the stove top. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat -- your pan must be very hot when the chicken is added. Pile the shredded cheese on the work surface created with the waxed paper or foil. Season your chicken breasts with black pepper but no salt; the cheese will add enough salt to the taste of the dish. Press the breasts firmly into the cheese. Coat both sides of breasts with as much cheese as possible. Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan. Set breasts into the skillet and cook 7 minutes on each side, until cheese forms an even, golden casing around the tender chicken breasts. While chicken cooks, combine chopped tomatoes with basil in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.Drain off any excess oil from chicken as you remove it from the skillet. Top chicken with big spoonfuls of raw sauce and serve with potatoes, peppers and onions.

Special equipment: kitchen twineFor the lamb: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Soak the guajillo chiles in warm water to soften. Puree with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the soaking liquid in a small food processor or blender to make a paste.In a small bowl, combine the guajillo paste, fennel, parsley, rosemary, thyme, olive oil, garlic and 1 teaspoon each kosher salt and pepper.Cut the lamb lengthwise, stopping 1/2 inch before going all the way through. Open the lamb like a book and spread with the fresh herb and chile mixture. Close the lamb and tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Season the outside heavily with salt and pepper.Put the lamb on a baking sheet and roast until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 300 degrees F. Transfer the lamb to a Dutch oven or ovenproof pot, add the chicken broth and wine and cover. Return the lamb to the oven and braise until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F, about 1 hour. Transfer the lamb to a cutting board (reserve the liquid in the pot) and let rest for 20 minutes before slicing.For the roasted potatoes: Meanwhile, toss the potatoes with the olive oil and sea salt in a roasting pan. Roast until tender, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, smash each potato to flatten slightly and then cook 10 more minutes.Pour the reserved lamb-braising liquid in a saucepan, set over medium-high heat and reduce by half. Whisk in the flour while boiling to thicken. Season with salt and pepper.Serve the lamb and roasted potatoes with the sauce.

You can make the sauce well in advance and store it in the fridge if you want.2) For tofu, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay out a few paper towels on a flat surface and place tofu on paper towels. Cover tofu with paper towels and add some weight to the tofu to press out the liquid. Let the tofu press for at least 20 minutes.3) Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking dish and add pressed tofu. Top each piece of tofu with a small drizzle of the bibimbap sauce.4) Bake tofu for 60 minutes, turning once halfway through.5) Meanwhile, cook rice according to instructions. I like to use a short grain white rice, but any rice will work.6) When you are about ready to serve, saute grated carrots and peppers with a drizzle of oil in a large skillet. Just cook until the veggies start to soften, but still have a tiny crunch, maybe a minute or two.7) Add another drizzle of oil to the pan and toss in the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes. You can toss in some bird chilis as well if you want to add some additional heat to the dish. Don't eat the bird chilis though. They will be too hot!8) Finally, you can wipe out the skillets, add a fresh drizzle of oil, and crack in a few eggs. Cook the eggs for 60 seconds until the whites are just set. Then you can either flip the eggs or cover the skillet and let the eggs steam for 30 seconds. Try not to overcook the yolk though.Make the bowls by scooping a big spoon of rice into each bowl and stirring in some of the sauce.

Add the garlic and stir, lightly frying for about a minute, removing before the garlic gets too brown (it can be golden). Pour the garlic and oil into a mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly.Add the red and yellow tomatoes, balsamic and basil to the bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to combine, and then taste and add more basil if needed, and more salt if needed (don't over salt, though!) Cover and refrigerate for an hour or two if you have the time.Cut the baguette into diagonal slices to allow for the most surface area possible. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet and grill half the bread on both sides, making sure they're nice and buttery. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and the other half of the bread.To serve, give the tomato mixture a final stir, and then spoon generously over the slices of bread.

pieces so they can chew easily).Grind katsuobushi (bonito flakes) into fine powder.Add dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and konbucha/salt) in a large mixing bowl. Whisk a few times to combine all together.In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and soy sauce together.Add egg mixture to the dry ingredients, and then slowly add dashi stock while you whisk all together.Heat the takoyaki pan over medium to medium high heat (on my stove, it\u2019s medium high). Using a brush, generously oil the takoyaki pan including the raise parts in between bowls.When you see smoke coming rising from the pan, pour the batter to fill the bowls. It\u2019s okay for the batter to slightly overflow the holes. If you have a measuring cup with a handle, pour the batter in the measuring cup first so that it\u2019s easier to pour. After you fill the holes, set timer for 3 minutes.Add 1-3 octopus pieces (depends on the size of octopus \u2013 I put 2-3 pieces) in each hole and sprinkle on the green onion.Then sprinkle tenkasu and powdered katsuobushi.After 3 minutes or so, when the bottom of the balls has hardened, break the connected batter in between each bowl with takoyaki picks (or skewers). Then turn each piece a 180 degree, stuffing in the edges as you are turning. The batter flows out from the inside of each bowl and creates the other side of the takoyaki ball. After you finish flipping, set timer for 4 minutes.Keep turning constantly so each piece will have nice round shape and will be evenly browned.Transfer takoyaki balls onto a plate and pour takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise. Finish off with sprinkling green dried seaweed and katsuobushi.

Line a 9x13 pan with foil and grease with butter or spray with cooking spray.Cut the butter into 1-inch slices and place in a small saucepan. Melt over low heat and add the chocolate chips, stirring until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Turn off the burner but leave the pan on it (to stay warm).Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the sugar and salt and whisk until incorporated. Gradually whisk the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Whisk in the vanilla.Place the flour and cocoa in sifter or a wire mesh strainer. Sift directly into the batter and stir with a spatula. Pour batter into prepared pan and spread until even. Place the 15 large Oreos evenly on top and press down lightly to cover with the batter.Bake for 28-34 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool to room temperature on the counter, then cover and let sit overnight (you can also refrigerate it overnight).Make the frosting: beat shortening and butter in a stand mixer with the paddle attached (or a hand mixer). Mix in marshmallow creme and vanilla. Slowly mix in powdered sugar. Spread frosting evenly over top of the brownies.

In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute. To the melted butter, add the sugars, egg, yogurt, vanilla, and whisk to combine. Add the bananas and stir to incorporate. Add the dry pudding mix and stir to incorporate (You are not making pudding; simply add the mix as a dry ingredient. The pudding mix could be replaced with 1 to 2 teaspoons cornstarch, and about 2 to 3 tablespoons flour. Like any dough or batter, there is some flexibility with how to make up for eliminating three ounces of dry mix). Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and stir until just combined, taking care not to over-mix or bars will be tougher as the gluten will over-develop. Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Add one teaspoon of jelly at a time to the top surface of bars, creating a surface dotted with little jelly blobs, dispersed randomly over the surface. With a table knife, swirl and marble the jelly through the batter using a zig-zag pattern going up-and-back, side-to-side a few times to disperse the jelly. It doesn't matter if the swirls are pretty or neat because while baking, it all turns into a golden shade of amber and melts together and you can't see the swirls; they're for taste not visual effect. Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes, tenting or covering the pan with foil halfway through baking if you judge the bars to be browning a bit fast on top (I cover with foil halfway through because my oven browns things too fast on the surface before the interior cooks through). Bake until top is set and golden, the center is not jiggly, and edges have pulled away slightly from sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted in the center will likely not come out completely clean because bars are dense and gooey, both from the bananas and jelly, which may prevent a clean toothpick test. The bars are meant to be gooey and based on moisture content in bananas, yogurt used, oven variance, and personal preference, cooking times could vary from about 40 to 60 minutes. Allow bars to cool in pan for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving. While cake cools, make the glaze. For the Vanilla Glaze, optional - The bars don't 'need' a glaze as they're moist and sweet on their own, but I prefer it. Melt butter in a small microwave-safe bowl, about 1 minute on high power. Slowly add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla, and whisk to combine. Add sugar as needed until desired glaze consistency is reached. Drizzle glaze over the top of bars before slicing and serving; or slice and glaze each piece individually. Unglazed bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days; or store glazed bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/peach-jelly-filled-banana-bread-bars-with-vanilla-glaze-520671", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 55, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
