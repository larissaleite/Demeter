Work quickly to incorporate and achieve pea size pieces. Then cut the remaining butter into 1/2\" to 1\" pieces and add to the flour/butter mixture. This time use only your fingers to quickly flatten the new butter pieces into chunks the size of your thumbnail. You want to leave these pieces larger than you think you should. Again, work quickly to keep the butter cold.Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the flour/butter mixture and mix just until the dough begins to mass. You may need to add the additional ice water for this to occur, a tablespoon at a time. The day's humidity will play a part in how much water you will need...a dry day will require more water. I ended up using the whole 1/2 cup of water, plus just a bit more, for these tarts.Remove the dough mass to a large piece of parchment paper and divide into 4 equal portions. Press each portion into flattened rounds about 4\" in diameter and 1/2\" thick. Wrap each disk tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Now turn your oven on to preheat to 375\u00b0.Remove one dough disk from the refrigerator and place on a large square of parchment paper that has been dusted lightly with flour. Lightly flour top of dough disk and top with another large square of parchment paper. Roll the dough from the center out, taking care to not let the outer edges get too thin. Roll into an 8\" to 9\" circle. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with remaining dough disks until you have 2 dough circles on each of 2 baking sheets.for the apple blackberry filling:While the dough disks are chilling in the refrigerator, peel, core, and slice apples and place them in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and salt over the apples. Toss lightly to completely coat. Then drizzle boiled cider over the apples and toss again. Right before adding this filling to the pastry circles give the apples a good stir to incorporate accumulated juices evenly. Divide apple mixture evenly between the 4 pastry circles, leaving an inch or 2 of bare dough around the perimeter of each circle. Fold up dough edges, bringing them toward the center of the tarts, gently crimping the dough at each fold. Dot the apple mixture with the butter. Tuck the blackberries into the apple mixture, 5 to 6 blackberries per tart. With a small pastry brush, brush half and half lightly onto the dough. Sprinkle with course sugar and cinnamon.Place pans in 375\u00b0 oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until filling is bubbling and pastry is beautifully browned. You may want to place a large rimmed pan or piece of foil on the rack below the rack where the tarts are, as juices from the filling may leak.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/apple-blackberry-tarts-497755", "dishTypes": ["dessert"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Norecipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chocolate-Almond-Granola-549309.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 549309, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Chocolate Almond Granola", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 109.17, "creditText": "Norecipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cups Marcona almonds crushed", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "almonds", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 12061, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "6 tablespoons melted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup cacao nibs", "aisle": "Health Foods", "name": "cacao nibs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cacao-nibs.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 98846, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup coco powder - unsweetened", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "coco lopez", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-of-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 93745, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup dried cherries roughly chopped", "aisle": "Dried Fruits", "name": "dried cherries", "metaInformation": ["dried", "roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cherries-dried.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 93822, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup honey adjust to taste", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 19296, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "4 cups rolled oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "rolled oats", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 8120, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened shredded coconut", "metaInformation": ["shredded", "unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10012108, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 43.0, "sourceUrl": "http://norecipes.com/recipe/chocolate-granola/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Put the oven rack in the middle position and preheat to 300 degrees F (150 C).", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg", "id": 404770, "name": "baking paper"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png", "id": 404645, "name": "frying pan"}], "step": "Mix all the ingredients (except the cherries) together in a bowl until the mixture is well combined and sticky.
