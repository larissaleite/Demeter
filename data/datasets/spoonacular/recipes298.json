If desiring to store leftovers, leave out at room temperature, as storing in a resealable storage\u00a0bag retains moisture, melts salt, and makes rolls moist.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/gluten-free-pretzel-rolls-604176", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "french"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/asparagus-cherry-pepper-and-bacon-quiche-733169.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 80, "id": 733169, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Asparagus, Cherry Pepper and Bacon Quiche", "preparationMinutes": 30, "pricePerServing": 177.39, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/3 cup chopped roasted asparagus", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "asparagus", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asparagus.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 11011, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": ["crumbled", "cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10123, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup roughly chopped jarred cherry peppers", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cherry", "metaInformation": ["jarred", "roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cherries.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 9070, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 1/4 cups heavy cream, half-and-half or milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 1053, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3/4 to 1 cup shredded jarlsberg cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "jarlsberg cheese", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/Swiss-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 93791, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon paprika or chile powder, or some grated lemon zest (optional)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lemon zest", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 9156, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup sauteed sliced onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onions", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 11282, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Store-bought or homemade pie dough", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "pie dough", "metaInformation": ["homemade", "store-bought"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 3.0, "id": 18334, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 39.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/asparagus-cherry-pepper-and-bacon-quiche-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 24, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png", "id": 404765, "name": "aluminum foil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a circle. Place the pizza dough on a pizza pan or pizza stone. 6. Evenly brush the olive oil on the pizza. Top with fresh mozzarella slices. Add the parmesan cheese. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes or until pizza crust is golden and cheese is melted.7. Remove the pizza from the oven and place arugula on top. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the arugula and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Garnish with additional parmesan cheese, if desired. Cut into slices and serve.Note-we made a thin crust pizza. Josh rolled the crust into about a 13-inch circle. If you want a thicker crust, don't roll it out as far.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/lemon-arugula-pizza-548235", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 15, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Taste of Home", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Saucy-Mushroom-Chicken-412185.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 412185, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Saucy Mushroom Chicken", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 196.8, "creditText": "Taste of Home", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup white wine or additional chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 6194, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 cups chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11260, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup heavy whipping cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy whipping cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons olive oil, divided", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["divided"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon each onion powder, paprika, dried basil, oregano and thyme", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "onion powder", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2026, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Mashed potatoes, optional", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "potatoes", "metaInformation": ["mashed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 11362, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (5 ounces each)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "skinless boneless chicken breast halves", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "skinless"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 30.0, "id": 1045062, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 61.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/saucy-mushroom-chicken", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Flatten chicken to 1/2-in. thickness.
