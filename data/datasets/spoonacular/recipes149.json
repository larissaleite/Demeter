Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and, when cool enough to handle, take the meat off the bones (reserve the meat for another purpose). Return the bones to the pot  and simmer for 1 hour more. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined sieve, discarding the solids. Cool the broth slightly, then refrigerate until cold, overnight or up to 3 days.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Using a slotted spoon, skim off the solidified chicken fat from the broth.

Add the seltzer and use a rubber spatula to mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Fill a large, wide pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Fill a small bowl with cold water and have nearby to keep your hands clean and wet. Working gently, without pressing, use clean, wet hands to form 1/2-inch-round matzo balls. As they are formed, drop them into the boiling water. When all of the matzo balls are formed, cover the pot with a round of parchment paper to keep them submerged (or partially cover the pot with a lid if you don't have parchment paper) and simmer very gently (don't let the water boil again) until cooked through and tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon, and arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. If not using that day, let cool to room temperature, then store the matzo balls in a single layer in an airtight container filled with cooled cooking liquid to cover for up to 2 days.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            To serve, gently reheat the matzo balls in a pot filled with matzo ball cooking liquid or fresh water to cover (when the water comes to a simmer, taste a matzo ball to see if it's hot enough, and either use immediately or continue to simmer until warmed to taste).                                                                                                                            8                                                                            In a separate pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil.

Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then put the cauliflower through a rice mill or ricer placed over a large bowl. If you are like me and do not own one, I learned from Deb at Smitten Kitchen that you can also grate it using a box grater.Add the egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups of flour, salt and nutmeg, and stir until the dough begins to come together. It will be sticky, but gradually add more flour until you achieve a dough that can be kneaded. Depending on the moisture of your cauliflower, you may have to add more flour.Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead, dusting with flour if necessary. Divide the dough into 4 pieces, then begin to roll out each piece into a rope about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into 1/2 inch pieces, dust with flour, then use a gnocchi paddle to create the signature grooves. A fork will also work. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and dusted with a little more flour. At this point, you can freeze the gnocchi if you are preparing it in advance: cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and place in a freezer. You can use it the following day, or transfer the frozen gnocchi to a freezer bag if storing for longer.When you are ready to cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath. Salt the boiling water, then drop the gnocchi (in batches if necessary) and let it cook for about 2 minutes. You will know the gnocchi is ready when it rises to the top. Scoop the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and drop the gnocchi in the ice bath to cool. Reserve about 1-2 cups of the boiling water for the sauce. Drain and dry the cooked gnocchi on paper towels.Make the  Creamy Cauliflower & Shiitake Mushroom SauceIn a large saute pan, heat about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and cook the cauliflower and shiitake mushrooms until the cauliflower has taken one some color and the mushrooms are tender and wilted. Season with a little salt as you stir. Reserve about half of the cauliflower and mushrooms and set aside.Add the pancetta to the saut\u00e9 pan and cook until it is brown. Add the leeks and garlic and cook until the leeks are wilted and the garlic fragrant. Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Carefully transfer to a blender (work in batches if necessary) and blend.Add additional oil to the saut\u00e9 pan and heat over medium heat. Add the gnocchi and let it brown, carefully stirring. Carefully add the cauliflower sauce. If it is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water. Season with salt and pepper.To serve, place the gnocchi in serving dish. Top with reserved cauliflower and mushrooms. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, parsley, and a touch of olive oil if desired.

Freeze them for at least 2 hours, or even overnight\u2014you want them to be like little rocks.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Near the end of the chilling period, get yourself set up. Have three shallow bowls handy: one with 1/2 cup of the flour, one with the beaten egg, and one containing the crushed vanilla wafers. Also get out a larger bowl, for mixing your batter.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Now, it's time to start heating the oil for frying. I poured about 6 cups of vegetable oil into a medium saucepan, so that it was about 4-5 inches deep. The exact quantity of oil required will depend on the size of your saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy or frying thermometer. The oil needs to reach 375\u00b0F on the thermometer, which will take about 10-12 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While the oil heats, prepare the batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in a shallow bowl and set aside for the moment. Place 3/4 cup of flour in a small bowl and stir in the cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In a mixing cup, stir together the milk, vinegar, and oil. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until smooth and free of most lumps. The batter should be thicker than a pancake batter\u2014if it seems too liquidy (as if it might drip off when you dip the Cadbury Creme Eggs in it), whisk in the remaining flour until it has reached the desired consistency.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Remove the Cadbury Creme Eggs from your freezer. I found that it is best to fry one cupcake at a time, so you could take them out of the freezer a couple at a time so that the eggs fried later on don't get too warm while sitting out.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Using a spoon, coat an egg with the batter mixture. Use floured hands to mold the batter around the egg so that every bit is covered.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First, dredge the battered Creme Egg in the flour, covering it completely. Tap off excess.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Now, coat the floured ball with the egg wash.                                                                                                                             9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Roll the egg wash coated ball in the cookie crumbs, coating on all sides.                                                                                                                             10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Using a slotted spoon, gently ease the crumb-coated orb into the hot oil. Once the batter has reached a pleasing golden hue (a minute or less), remove the Cadbury Creme Scotch Egg from the oil and transfer to a plate covered with paper towel to soak up the excess grease.                                                                                                                             11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining Cadbury Creme Eggs, battering and coating them one at a time directly before dipping in the frying oil. While frying, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up or down accordingly so that it remains at 375\u00b0F. If the oil is too cold it won't fry quickly enough and the chocolate eggs will soak up too much grease; if it is too hot, the outside will get dark before the inside is fully warmed, leaving you with a delicious shell but a still gooey batter on the inside.                                                                                                                             12
