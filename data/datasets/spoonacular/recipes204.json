Roughly chop the onions, finely chop the garlic and peel and finely chop the ginger.                 </p><p>        Place the apple, onion, garlic, ginger, chilli flakes and fruit into a large, wide saucepan. Stir in the vinegar, sugar and salt. Stir the mixture over a medium heat until all the sugar has dissolved.                 </p><p>        Once the sugar has dissolved, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat slightly and simmer the chutney for around one hour, stirring every so often. As it thickens, stir more frequently and watch that the sugar does not begin to stick to the bottom of the pan. The chutney is done when you can scrape a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan and the chutney does not flow back into the gap.                 </p><p>        Meanwhile, to clean the jam jars, preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1. Wash the jars well in warm soapy water then rinse thoroughly under running water. Leave the jars and lids to dry, upside down, in the oven. (Or you can clean the jars by putting them through the hot cycle of a dishwasher.)                </p><p>        Carefully spoon the chutney into the sterilised jars and seal while hot. Store in a cool, dark place for about a month before eating, to let the flavours mellow.</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/how-to-make-chutney-629988", "dishTypes": ["condiment", "dip", "spread"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 7, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Emily Bites", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Crispy-Corn-Fritters-570265.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 570265, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Crispy Corn Fritters", "pricePerServing": 27.8, "creditText": "Emily Bites", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 T canola oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "canola oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "3 large uncooked ears of corn, husked and rinsed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ears of corn", "metaInformation": ["large", "husked", "rinsed", "uncooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-on-the-cob.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11167, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 egg, beaten", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg", "metaInformation": ["beaten"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["all-purpose"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 garlic cloves, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic cloves", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "Salt & pepper to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "Salt & Pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 12.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 scallions, diced small", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "scallions", "metaInformation": ["diced", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11291, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 shallot, diced small", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shallot", "metaInformation": ["diced", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11677, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 10.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.emilybites.com/2012/07/crispy-corn-fritters.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/chefs-knife.jpg", "id": 404745, "name": "knife"}], "step": "Using a sharp knife, cut the kernels off of the corn cobs.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg", "id": 405907, "name": "mixing bowl"}], "step": "Place the kernels into a large mixing bowl and add the shallot, scallions and garlic.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with 9 liners and spray with nonstick cooking spray.Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and remaining 5 tablespoons sugar until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs one a time, stirring between each addition, followed by the vanilla extract. Beat until smooth.Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Add half the flour mixture to the creamed butter, then add in the apple butter, sour cream and reserved 1/4 cup hard cider and combine again. Add the remaining flour and beat until just combined. Divide the batter among the 9 liners and cook until a toothpick comes out clean, about 20 minutes.While the cupcakes are still warm, brush the tops with the remaining 1/2 cup hard cider-sugar mixture.
