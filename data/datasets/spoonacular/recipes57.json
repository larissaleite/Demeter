Holding the lemon over a bowl to catch the juice, use a paring knife to cut along either side of each segment to free it from the membranes, letting each segment fall into the bowl. When you\u2019ve removed all the segments, squeeze any juice from the membranes into the bowl and then discard. Remove the seeds and set the segments aside in another small dish. Measure the lemon juice in the bowl. Cut the remaining lemon in half and squeeze another 2 tablespoons of juice into the bowl. Set aside.3.

stone or 2 large rimmed baking sheets; a 1-inch star-shaped cookie cutterFor the dough: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until mixed. Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add the ice water through the feed tube, pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together, it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water.Turn the dough out onto a work surface and press it together by hand. Divide the dough in half; wrap each piece in a large piece of plastic wrap, pressing each firmly into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.Adjust an oven rack to the bottom position of the oven and put a pizza stone or large baking sheet on it. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the filling: Toss together the nectarines, brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until the cornstarch dissolves. Add the raspberries and gently toss to combine.To assemble the pie: Let the dough stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place one piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment. Roll into a rough 14-by-12 inch rectangle (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up, then continue rolling). Repeat rolling with the second piece of dough.Pile the nectarine-raspberry filling into the center of one piece of dough and spread evenly, leaving at least a 1-inch border. Dot the filling with the butter.With a 1-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 4 to 5 stars from the second piece of dough (reserve the cut-outs for decorating). To transport the dough to the pie, roll it up onto the rolling pin and then unroll it over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, then fold and crimp to create a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg; decorate the top crust with the star cut-outs and brush them with egg too. Generously sprinkle the pie with granulated sugar. Using the bottom piece of parchment paper, slide the pie onto another rimmed baking sheet (trim the parchment if there's any overhang).Put the baking sheet with the pie directly on the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet (this helps make the bottom crust crisp and flaky). Bake the pie until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil. Some of the filling may bubble from the vents onto the parchment paper; don't fret-just embrace the rustic charm.)Let cool. Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.  All rights reserved.

Let the water completely drain off.Place a large skillet on the stove over medium heat, add the olive oil and let the oil start to shimmer a bit. Toss in the pistachios, cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, turning them to brown them on all sides. Add the cherries, continue cooking for about 2 minutes. Add a touch more oil if needed. Now toss the rinsed and dried farro in the skillet and cook until it warms back up and everything mixes together perfectly. Add some salt and pepper to taste.

Blanch the asparagus in two batches until bright green and just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the asparagus to an ice bath, or put them in a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Cut the asparagus into 1-inch pieces. Put 2 cups of the stalk pieces in a small food processor, reserving the tips. Add the mint, garlic, lemon juice, pine nuts, olive oil, and salt, and pulse. Add 1/3 cup water, and pulse until the mixture has the consistency of pesto. Mix in the Parmesan, and taste for seasoning.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Place the reserved asparagus tips in a mixing bowl, and toss with the tomatoes, burrata, olive oil, and salt.

milk into a small saucepan and heat on medium heat until steamy (but not boiling). Remove from heat.  Stir in the butter and sugar until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved.  Pour into a mixing bowl.  Mix in yeast mixture and egg.2 Mix in salt and cardamom.  Slowly add in 2 cups of the flour.  After the first two cups of flour gradually add more flour until a soft dough starts to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl.3 Turn out onto a floured surface and knead dough for 7 to 10 minutes until smooth, OR use a dough hook in a stand-up mixer and knead the dough that way for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep the dough from being too sticky.  Note that the dough should remain soft, so take care not to add too much flour.  4 Place the dough in an oiled bowl, covered with a clean tea-towel or with plastic wrap.  Let rise for an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.At this point you can make a simple braided bread if you want (2 loaves), by punching the dough down, dividing the dough in half, and then dividing each half into three equal parts, rolling the dough pieces into ropes, braiding them, and tucking the ends under.  Or you can get more fancy, which is what we've done here, with a filling, and forming the dough into a wreath shape.  The following directions are for the wreath form.5 Press the dough down to deflate it a bit.  Divide the dough into 2 equal parts.  Take one part (saving the other for wreath number 2) and use your fingers to spread it into a 8-inch by 16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface.  If you are having difficulty getting the dough to keep its shape, just do what you can and let it sit for 5 minutes before trying again.  Like pizza dough, the dough needs time to relax while you are forming it.  Brush the dough with melted butter, leaving at least a half inch border on the edges so the dough will stick together when rolled.  Mix together the brown and white sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle the dough with half of the mixture (saving the other half for the second batch of dough).  Sprinkle on more fillings, as you like, such as raisins, slivered almonds, or almond paste. You could even sprinkle on some cream cheese for a creamier filling.6 Carefully roll the dough up lengthwise, with the seam on the bottom.  Carefully transfer to a greased baking sheet.  Form a circle with the dough on the baking sheet, connecting the ends together.7 Using scissors, cut most of the way through the dough, cutting on a slant. Work your way around the dough circle.  After each cut, pull out the dough segment either to the right or to the left, alternating as you go around the circle.  The dough circle will look like a wreath when you are done.Repeat steps 5, 7, and 8 with the rest of the dough, to form a second wreath.8 Cover lightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm area for a second rise.  Let rise for about 40 minutes to an hour; the dough should again puff up in size.9 Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.  Whisk together the egg yolks and cream.  Use a pastry brush to brush over the dough.  Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes.  After the first 15 minutes of baking, if the top is getting well browned, tent with some aluminum foil.10 Remove from oven and let cool completely. Whisk together powdered sugar and water to create a final glaze (optional).  Add more water if the glaze is too thick to drizzle, add more powdered sugar if the glaze is too runny.
