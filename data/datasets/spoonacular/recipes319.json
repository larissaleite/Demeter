Rinse under cold water andpat dry with kitchen paper. Score theskin of the fish several times witha sharp knife to help prevent it fromcurling during cooking. Leave the bones(but not the heads) to soak in cold water.To make the sauce, heat a little olive oilin a pan and cook the shallots for about5 mins until golden and soft. Add themushrooms and continue to cook for10 mins, stirring occasionally. Drain thefish bones, add to the pan and cook for5-6 mins. Add the vinegar and let it cometo the boil for 3 mins, then add the stock,season lightly and simmer for 30 mins,skimming at regular intervals. Passthrough a fine sieve into a clean pan,bring back to the boil and whisk in thebutter to thicken and gloss the sauce.Heat a non-stick frying pan until smokinghot, add a few drops of oil, then add thefish, skin side down. Season with salt andpepper and press the fish down with apalette knife if it begins to curl up. Oncethe skin is well browned, turn the filletsover and cook the other side; the wholeprocess should take no more than 5-6mins, depending on the thickness of thefish.

Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and brown sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in the egg and mix until combined, about 1 minute. Add in the pumpkin and mix until totally incorporated. Stir in the creamer and vanilla.Pour the dry ingredients into the stand mixer bowl. Mix until just incorporated. Using a small (2 tsp) cookie scoop, scoop the dough onto two parchment-lined baking sheets (about 20 cookies per sheet). Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the bottoms are lightly browned and tops spring back when you push down on them slightly. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes and then remove to a wire rack.For the frosting, whisk together the confectioner's sugar, malt powder, and salt. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the milk and vanilla.Melt the butter on medium heat in a small pan. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until it turns amber and starts to smell nutty. Immediately pour into the bowl of powdered sugar. Whisk together to combine, adding in the milk when it becomes too hard to stir.
