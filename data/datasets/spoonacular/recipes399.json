Pour all at once into the flour mixture, add eggs, then blend at low speed just until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 3 minutes. On very low speed (or by hand with a wooden spoon) gradually stir 1 and 1/2 cups of the remaining flour. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup flour a few tablespoons at a time, only adding enough to make a firm dough. It will feel tacky, but should not be excessively sticky.Switch to a dough hook (if using a stand mixer) or turn out on a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (6-8 minutes by hand or 4-6 minutes by machine). Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat (this prevents a crust from forming). Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until the dough nearly doubles in size. To test the dough, gently press it with two fingers. If your indent remains, the dough is ready.Prepare Filling: In a small bowl, combine the honey, nuts, raisins, orange juice concentrate, and cinnamon.
