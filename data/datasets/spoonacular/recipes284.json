Pour off all but 2 Tablespoons of fat from the skillet; reserve the extra. Put the onion in the pan and saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the sugar over the onion and saut\u00e9, stirring constantly to prevent sticking or burning, until the onion turns deep golden and the edges caramelize, 3-5 minutes. Scrape the onion into a large mixing bowl.3. Return the pan to medium heat and add 2 Tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Add the apples and celery. Saut\u00e9 until softened, 5-7 minutes. Add the parsley, thyme, sage, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a few grinds of pepper; saut\u00ea another minute. Scrape the contents of the pan into the bowl with the onion.4. When you're ready to bake the stuffing, add the bread cubes and bacon to the bowl of saut\u00e9ed vegetables and toss. Add the beaten eggs, broth, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a few more grinds of pepper; mix well. Transfer to the prepared baking pan.5. Half an hour before the turkey is done (an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh should read 155\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 F), put the stuffing in the oven next to the turkey and bake uncovered at 350\u00b0 F. until the top is light and crusty, about 1 hour.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/dressing-w-apples-bacon-caramelized-onions-517355", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 145, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Lifes Ambrosia", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sriracha-Chicken-Salad-Sandwich-567247.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 1, "id": 567247, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sriracha Chicken Salad Sandwich", "preparationMinutes": 75, "pricePerServing": 267.43, "creditText": "Lifes Ambrosia", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 rib celery, diced small", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "celery", "metaInformation": ["diced", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg", "unitLong": "rib", "unitShort": "rib", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11143, "unit": "rib"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh cilantro", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 11165, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "pinch kosher salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup mayonnaise", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "mayonnaise", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 4025, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "oil for frying", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": ["for frying"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon rice vinegar", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "rice vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1022053, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 -

Chill cake in the refrigerator while making the ganache (in the following step).Place the semi-sweet chocolate chips and the creamer in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute. Stir chocolate until melted and combined with creamer (I like to use a whisk, but beware this causes air bubbles in the ganache, disrupting a smooth look). If necessary, heat for another 30 seconds to melt chocolate completely.Allow the ganache to cool for 30 minutes and then spread over top of the cake.Allow cake to chill for at least 3 hours before serving.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/green-velvet-cheesecake-cake-598040", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/oven-fried-chicken-286231.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 286231, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Oven Fried Chicken", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 64.74, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.75, "id": 2031, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "4 medium sized skinless chicken breasts and 4 skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry (about 3 1/2 pounds chicken)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "chicken thighs", "metaInformation": ["skinless", "dry", "medium", "rinsed", "( 3 1/2 pounds chicken)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-thighs.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 4.0, "id": 5091, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 cups corn cereal flakes, pulsed in a food processor to fine crumbs (about 1/2 cup)", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "corn flakes cereal", "metaInformation": ["fine"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornflakes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 8020, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 sleeve (about 20) whole-grain salted crackers, pulsed in a food processor until fine (about 1/2 cup)", "aisle": "Savory Snacks", "name": "crackers", "metaInformation": ["salted", "fine", "( 20)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 18621, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "dijon mustard", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002046, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "2 egg whites", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1022020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 cup lowfat, plain yogurt", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "lowfat mayo", "metaInformation": ["plain"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4641, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sesame seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 12023, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 32.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ellie-krieger/oven-fried-chicken-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Watch how to make this recipe.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
