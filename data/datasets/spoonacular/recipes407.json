Whisk together sugar and flour in a large heavy saucepan. Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, and 2 cups cream in a bowl. Whisk cream mixture into sugar mixture, and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, 15 minutes or until very thick. (Mixture will come to a simmer during the last 2 to 3 minutes.) Remove from heat; whisk in vanilla bean paste, and transfer to a medium bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on warm custard (to prevent a film from forming). Cool completely (about 1 1/2 hours).2. Whisk cream cheese into cream mixture until smooth; whisk in pumpkin.3. Stir together espresso and brandy. Brush flat sides of about 24 ladyfingers with espresso mixture. Stand lady fingers around edge of a 10-inch springform pan, placing rounded sides against pan. Line bottom of pan with additional ladyfingers, cutting if necessary to cover bottom of pan completely. Brush espresso mixture over ladyfingers on bottom of pan.4. Spread one-third of cream cheese mixture over ladyfingers on bottom. Repeat layers twice with remaining ladyfingers, espresso mixture, and cream cheese mixture, ending with cream cheese mixture. (Reserve any remaining ladyfingers for another use.) Cover and chill 4 hours to 2 days.5. Beat remaining 1 cup cream at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy; gradually add powdered sugar, beating until soft peaks form.

Let the hot dog cool and then place in a bowl.Add the \u00bc cup of arrowroot to pre-coat the hot dogs.To make the batter add the coconut flour, arrowroot, baking powder and salt to a bowl and blend well with a spoon.In a separate bowl combine the melted butter, honey, egg and milk.Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until smooth.The batter will be rather thick but it's necessary so that it will stick to the hot dogs.Drop the hot dogs into the batter and coat on all sides. I will \"dunk\" them into the batter and let them sit for a couple of seconds. Use a spoon to help coat them and remove from the batter.I roll them around several times to get a nice thick coating and scoop them up with a spoon so I can get more batter on the bottom of them.Drop the corn dog in the hot oil and brown on both sides.One side may be prettier than the other but they still taste excellent.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/paleo-corn-dogs-541849", "dishTypes": ["fingerfood", "antipasti", "starter", "snack", "appetizer", "antipasto", "hor d'oeuvre"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 18, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "How Sweet Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/chocolate-stuffed-oatmeal-bars-728538.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 728538, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Chocolate Stuffed Oatmeal Bars", "pricePerServing": 27.2, "creditText": "How Sweet Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3/4 cup dark chocolate chips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dark chocolate chips", "metaInformation": ["dark"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 10019071, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup loosely packed light brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "light brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["light", "loosely packed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup peanut butter", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "peanut butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 16098, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 1/2 cups quick cooking oats", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "quick cooking oats", "metaInformation": ["quick"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 2.5, "id": 8402, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup unsalted butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1145, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 26.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.howsweeteats.com/2016/04/chocolate-stuffed-oatmeal-bars/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 10, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png", "id": 404765, "name": "aluminum foil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg", "id": 404646, "name": "baking pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}], "step": "Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with aluminum foil.In a saucepan, heat the butter and sugar over medium heat, whisking until the sugar dissolves.
