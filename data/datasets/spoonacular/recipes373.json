Carefully dry ribs with paper towels, then add to oil and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes, turning and agitating occasionally as they cook. Using a slotted spoon or chopsticks, transfer ribs to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the oil in the wok.  Return wok to medium heat and heat oil until shimmering. Add the scallions and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the ribs and stir-fry for a minute longer.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Carefuly add enough water to cover the ribs at least \u00be of the way, about 1 cup.  Add the soy sauce, sugar, and salt.  Simmer over low heat until the ribs are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.  As the liquid reduces, turn the ribs and spoon the liquid over them.                                                                                                                              4                                                                            When the sauce has reduced to syrupy consistency, add the vinegar and cook for a few minutes longer.  Turn off the heat, drizzle in the sesame oil if using, and serve warm or at room temperature.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chinese-takeout-style-sweet-and-sour-spare-ribs-202918", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 60, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/lime-beer-cocktail-544867.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 544867, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Lime Beer Cocktail", "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 4.74, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 (6-pack) light beer", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "beer", "metaInformation": ["light", "(6-pack)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beer.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 14006, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 lime, sliced in half", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "lime", "metaInformation": ["sliced in half"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 9159, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 can frozen limeade", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "limeade", "metaInformation": ["frozen"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/limeade.jpg", "unitLong": "can", "unitShort": "can", "amount": 1.0, "id": 99185, "unit": "can"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 24.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sandra-lee/lime-beer-cocktail-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 0, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Watch how to make this recipe.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Pour beer into a large pitcher.", "number": 2, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beer.jpg", "id": 14006, "name": "beer"}]}, {"equipment": [], "step": "Add still-frozen limeade and stir to combine.
