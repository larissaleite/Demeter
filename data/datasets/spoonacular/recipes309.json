Mix well.Once the blueberries begin to burst, remove from heat and add coconut flour. Mix until completely combined. Let sit for about 5 minutes to thicken up.When the crust is done cooking, pour the blueberry mixture on top.In a bowl, add nuts, coconut, sesame seeds, honey, cinnamon and salt and mix together and mix.Add clumps of the nuts to the top of the blueberry mixture.Add to oven and bake for 15 minutes.Let cool for 10 minutes, remove from pan, then place on a cool rack to cool for 5 more minutes before cutting into 6-8 squares.Store in fridge.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/blueberry-pumpkin-muffin-breakfast-bars-509720", "dishTypes": ["morning meal", "brunch", "breakfast"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 65, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/dry-rubbed-rib-eye-336771.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 15, "id": 336771, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Dry-Rubbed Rib-Eye", "preparationMinutes": 1490, "pricePerServing": 731.56, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "brown sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-light.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19334, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1022020, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "Oil, for brushing grill", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": ["for brushing grill"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Extra-virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["extra-virgin"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 teaspoon pulverized crushed red pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["red", "crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 teaspoons pimenton (Smoked Spanish Paprika)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pimenton", "metaInformation": ["smoked", "spanish", "( Paprika)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2028, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "2 (22 to 24-ounce) bone-in rib-eye steaks", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "rib-eye steaks", "metaInformation": ["bone-in"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ribeye-raw.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 44.0, "id": 23232, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "3 tablespoons salt*", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 3.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "tablespoons"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 74.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/dry-rubbed-rib-eye-recipe2.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 28, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Watch how to make this recipe.", "number": 1, "ingredients": []}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/plastic-wrap.jpg", "id": 404730, "name": "plastic wrap"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg", "id": 404706, "name": "grill"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Combine all of the dry ingredients in a bowl.
