Add eggs, 1 teaspoon salt,  teaspoon pepper to the onions and pulse several times until the onions are finely chopped. Scrape the onion-egg mixture into the bowl with the potatoes. Add matzoh meal. Mix thoroughly.Add the chopped spinach to the skillet and saut over medium heat, stirring constantly, until wilted (a minute or two) Add to the potato mixture and stir through.Spray or lightly oil two baking sheet pans. Scoop up a heaping tablespoon of potato mixture, roll it into a ping-pong sized ball, place it on the prepared pan. Repeat until you've used up all the potato mixture. You should get about 50 pieces. Push your thumb down on the center of each ball to flatten it slightly and make a depression - similar to how you'd make thumbprint cookies.Bake knishes for 30 minutes in the top and bottom of the oven, switching the position of the trays half way through. Turn the oven up to broil and let the top tray brown for 2-3 minutes. Remove it and set the other tray on the top shelf and let it brown for 2-3 minutes.Set knishes out on a platter or serving tray.

When cool enough to handle, remove the grapes from the stems and set aside.For the dressing: Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the honey, Dijon mustard and lemon juice. Continue to whisk while slowly streaming in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.For the salad: Add the celery and chicken to the bowl with the dressing. Core, halve, then slice the apple into 1/4-inch slices, and add to the bowl. Add the walnuts and cooled grapes to the bowl and toss to coat everything with the dressing.To serve, line a salad plate with the lettuce leaves. Spoon a quarter of the chicken salad over the top of each leaf. Serve immediately.

Grease an 8x8\" pan and set aside. Combine all ingredients, except oats, in a food processor or blender and blend until smooth, scrapping sides as needed. Stir in the oats and pour batter into the pan. Bake approximately 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool before slicing.  Chef's Note: if you find these brownies are too soft or too fudge-y, add another 1/4 cup oats or flour.Nutritional InformationServing Size: 1Servings Per Batch:
