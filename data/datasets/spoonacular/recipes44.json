Heat the oil remaining in the pan over medium heat, add the shallots and garlic, and fry briefly, until translucent.  Add the chile powder and tomatoes and, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, cook at a strong simmer until the tomatoes have broken down into a softened mass, about 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Stir in the fish sauce and salt, then taste and adjust the seasoning if you wish.

                                            Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan in oven until skins split and nuts are pale golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven (turn oven off), then wrap hazelnuts in a kitchen towel and rub to remove any loose skins. Cool nuts completely. Pulse nuts with granulated sugar in a food processor until finely chopped.

Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in melted chocolate until combined. Add milk and vanilla, beating to incorporate. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Stir in nut mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill dough until firm, 2 to 3 hours.

Halve dough and chill 1 half, wrapped in plastic wrap. Roll remaining half into 1-inch balls, placing them on a sheet of wax paper as rolled.

Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.Place the creme fraiche in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and swirl the beet reduction into the creme fraiche.For the buttered noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the noodles and cook until al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain the noodles, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water.Melt the butter in a large saute pan, add the noodles and some of the cooking liquid and toss to coat. Stir in the dill and parsley and season with salt and pepper.For the stroganoff: Season both sides of the beef with salt and pepper and then the steak rub. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the beef and cook on both sides until golden brown, a crust has formed and the meat is cooked to medium rare, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice into 1/2-inch thick slices.Add the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the mushrooms and cook until lightly golden brown. Add the shallots and garlic and continue cooking until soft, the mushrooms are deep golden brown and the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the beef stock, bring it to a boil and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.To serve: Put some of the noodles in each bowl. Top with the mushrooms, sliced steak and a dollop of the beet creme fraiche. Garnish with parsley leaves and dill.

"instructions": "Directions                                                        Make the base: Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, extending it over the sides. Put the butter in a medium heatproof bowl; position the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water (the bowl should not touch the water). Once the butter melts, stir in the sugar and cocoa. Whisk in the egg; cook, whisking, until the mixture is warm and the consistency of hot fudge, 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; mix in the saltine crumbs and peanuts. Press the crust into the pan. Set aside the saucepan of water.Make the filling: Spread the jelly over the crust in the pan; place in the freezer for a few minutes. Beat 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon butter, the peanut butter and confectioners' sugar with a mixer until light. Spread over the jelly layer; return to the freezer while you make the glaze.Place the chocolate and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a heatproof bowl; set over the pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat; stir until smooth. When cool but still runny, spread the glaze over the chilled peanut butter layer. Freeze for another 30 minutes.Use the foil flaps to remove the bars from the pan; cut into squares while still cold. Serve cold and keep leftovers refrigerated.Photograph by Kate Sears                                                            Thanks for your feedback! We made another batch of these delicious cookies, and agree that the bars are best cut while cold. Also, make sure to use roasted, salted peanuts for the fullest flavor.
