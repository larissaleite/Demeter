The chili powder will make the muffins/bread appear much more brown on top than usual so use a toothpick to test the doneness (a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out clean, not with raw goo on it).", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chili-cheese-cornbread-591631", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 30, "servings": 15, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Baked by Rachel", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Red-Velvet-Cake-Ice-Cream-629508.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 30, "id": 629508, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Red Velvet Cake Ice Cream", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 97.88, "creditText": "Baked by Rachel", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2oz cream cheese, softened", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "5 egg yolks", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg yolks", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 5.0, "id": 1125, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4C granulated sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "granulated sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "Cs", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 0.75, "id": 19335, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1C powdered sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "powdered sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "C", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19336, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "1C red velvet cake cubes", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "red velvet cake mix", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-velvet-cake.jpg", "unitLong": "C", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10018099, "unit": "C"}, {"originalString": "Pinch salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "pinch"}, {"originalString": "1 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "unsalted butter", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsp", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1145, "unit": "Tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 tsp vanilla", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2050, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1C whole milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "whole milk", "metaInformation": ["whole"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "C", "unitShort": "C", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1077, "unit": "C"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 26.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bakedbyrachel.com/red-velvet-cake-ice-cream/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 29, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/strainer.png", "id": 405600, "name": "sieve"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg", "id": 404669, "name": "sauce pan"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png", "id": 404661, "name": "whisk"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Add 1 cup heavy cream to a large bowl with a mesh strainer on top.
