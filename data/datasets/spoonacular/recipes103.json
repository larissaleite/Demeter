In large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and 2 tablespoons sugar until mixture is thick and pale yellow in color. Secure bowl to counter by wrapping a damp kitchen towel around the base, or by setting it on top of a rubber non-skid mat, then, slowly pour in the hot cream, vigorously whisking to incorporate.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer mixture to now-empty saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and registers 160\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer.

Alternatively, place chocolate in metal bowl that fits over a saucepan. Bring about 2 inches of water to boil in saucepan and arrange bowl over pan, making sure bottom of bowl does not make contact with water. Stir until chocolate is completely melted, smooth, and glossy.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Whisk melted chocolate into custard until thoroughly incorporated.

Alternatively, place custard bowl in an ice bath and stir until completely cold, about 10 minutes. Mixture will be very dense.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Once custard is chilled, in a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, beat egg whites on medium speed until frothy, then, slowly add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and continue beating until firm, but not dry, peaks form. Stir 1/3 of whites into custard to loosen, then carefully fold in the remaining whites with a rubber spatula.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Wipe out egg white bowl, and beat remaining 1 cup cream on medium speed to soft peaks, then fold into mixture. Cover and refrigerate until needed (mousse may be made up to 24 hours in advance).                                                                                                                            8                                                                            For the Assembly: Once popover mixture has rested (mixture should rest at lest 30 minutes) mix just to reincorporate. Divide batter equally between popover cups and bake until puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack and cool in pan about 5 minutes.

Weigh out 140 grams. (If there is less, don't panic. The recipe will still work.)Line four baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. Sift almond flour, ground cashews, powdered sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.Place egg whites in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Start whipping on medium speed. (Whipping slowly creates a stable meringue structure.) After a few minutes, the egg whites will being to foam. When they are almost fully whipped, slowly add the cane sugar a tablespoon at a time. Continue whipping. After all of the cane sugar has been added, turn the speed to high and whip to firm peaks.Add the dry ingredients to the egg whites all at once. Fold them together until a shiny magma-like mass forms. Don't be afraid to fold at the beginning, but as the batter starts to become shiny, watch it to see how it flows. Place 1 teaspoon of the batter on a silicone mat to test. If after 30 seconds it leaves a point on the top, it needs more folding. The batter should flow enough that it doesn't leave a point or spread too much. If it spreads too much, the macarons will not develop the proper \"feet.\"Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a plain, round \u00bd\" pastry tip. Pipe the batter into 1\" circles about 1-2\" apart. Sprinkle all or some of the piped macarons with the finely chopped cashews. Let the macarons sit on the cookie sheets at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. The tops will develop a skin that is dry to the touch.Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degree Celsius). Place one baking sheet in the center rack of the oven. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees Celsius). Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet front to back and bake for an additional 5 minutes. As oven temperatures vary, to check for doneness, gently jiggle the macaron. It will stick to the baking mat and the center will feel set, not runny. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let macarons cool completely on the sheet before trying to remove them.Increase the oven temperature back to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and repeat the process with the remaining baking sheets. (If you don't have four baking sheets to use, be sure to let them completely cool off before baking the next batch.)To fill and assemble: Open the dulce de leche and stir a little bit to loosen it. (The La Lechera brand I used was really thick--perfect for this, but required that I was extra gentle so I didn't crush the shells while filling them.)When the macaron shells have completely cooled, remove them from the baking sheets. Match up the macarons so that the ones with similar sizes are together. Turn half of them over and spread about 1 teaspoon of the dulce de leche on the bottom. Match up with the top and gently press together.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cashew-dulce-de-leche-french-macaron-573833", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 100, "servings": 36, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Baker Bettie", "cuisines": ["southern"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Buttermilk-Bacon-Biscuits-with-Blackberry-Jam-502602.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 502602, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Buttermilk Bacon Biscuits with Blackberry Jam", "creditText": "Baker Bettie", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon (about 5 cooked strips)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon", "metaInformation": ["crumbled", "cooked", "( 5 strips)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10123, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 oz bacon cold fat (or cold shortening)", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "bacon fat", "metaInformation": ["cold", "(or shortening)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bacon.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 3.0, "id": 4609, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "4 tsp baking powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking powder", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 4.0, "id": 18371, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp baking soda", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "baking soda", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18372, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 cup buttermilk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "buttermilk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1230, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "12 oz flour", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 12.0, "id": 20081, "unit": "oz"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 60.0, "sourceUrl": "http://bakerbettie.com/buttermilk-bacon-biscuits-blackberry-jam/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "aggregateLikes": 106, "instructions": "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, bacon, baking powder, and baking soda.

Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the shallots are tender.Pour in the vodka and it will deglaze your pan. All those lovely brown bits will release from the bottom of the skillet and create and rich and flavorful sauce.

Let that reduce for 10-15 minutes and stir occasionally to make sure it isn't burning. It's okay if sauce is still a bit on the thin side after this as it will cook more on the chicken.2) To start the chicken, heat cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil and sear your chicken legs for 5-6 minutes until they are browned.3) Coat chicken in a nice layer of the BBQ sauce and cook in a preheated 400 degree Fahrenheit oven (just transfer cast iron from stovetop to oven) for 15-20 minutes until chicken is cooked through.4) Baste chicken again with sauce five minutes before they are done and serve them immediately with some extra sauce on the side.

Use a fork to mix and mash and fold the chives, shallot and salt into the butter, until everything is combined. Transfer half the compound butter to a small saucepan and set aside. (note: You can make the butter ahead and store it, tightly covered, in the fridge, for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 weeks. Bring it to room temperature before using.)Peel and slice the potatoes: Fill a large bowl halfway with cold water. Add vinegar. Peel potatoes, scraping a tiny bit extra off the bottom of each potato, with the peeler, to make a flat stable surface, so they don't roll around when you slice them. Place potatoes into the bowl of water, as you peel them, to prevent discoloration.Cut The Potato into Hasselbacks Take a potato out of the water and dry it. Lay it, lengthwise, between two wooden-handled spatulas or two chopsticks. The wood on either side of the potato will prevent you from cutting all the way through. (see instructional photos in post) Make slices, about  of an inch apart, along the entire length of the potato. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Place potatoes on baking sheet. Lightly coat each potato with olive oil, using a pastry brush.Cook and Baste The Hasselbacks: Bake for 35 minutes. Heat the chive butter in the saucepan just until it melts. Baste the top of each potato with about 1 teaspoon of melted butter, letting it drip into the slits. Bake for another 30-40 minutes longer, or until the potatoes are nicely browned in spots and cooked through.To Serve:  Serve hot. Just before serving top each potato with a teaspoon or two of compound butter. Season potatoes with sea salt and cracked pepper, to taste.

Cover bowl and refrigerate. Heat olive oil a large cast iron dutch oven over medium high heat. Add onion and saute about 4 minutes until golden, add garlic and saute 1 more minute. Add chicken broth and diced potatoes and bring mixture just to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, cover pot and cook 15 - 20 minutes until potatoes are very tender. In a mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups milk with 1/4 cup flour (whisk very well to break up flour) and pour mixture into soup. Increase temperature to medium high heat, and bring mixture just to a boil, stirring constantly (stirring constantly will help break down the potatoes a bit). Once mixture reaches a boil, reduce heat to low, add ranch dressing mixture from refrigerator, 1 cup (4 oz) grated Cheddar cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and season with black pepper to taste. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring frequently (note, if you want smaller potato chunks in the soup you can simply mash the soup with a potato masher to break them down a bit more). Serve warm, sprinkle each serving with remaining 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, chopped bacon, and chopped green onions. *you can use low sodium chicken broth if you prefer, for this recipe I just used regular and didn't add any salt to the soup. If you use low sodium you may want to add additional salt to the soup.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cheesy-bacon-ranch-potato-soup-543883", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Cupcakes and Kale Chips", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Balsamic-Glazed-Cauliflower-Wings-for--SundaySupper-with-GalloFamily-492828.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 492828, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Balsamic Glazed Cauliflower \u201cWings\u201d for #SundaySupper with @GalloFamily", "creditText": "Cupcakes and Kale Chips", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00bc cup balsamic vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "balsamic vinegar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2069, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 large head cauliflower", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cauliflower", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg", "unitLong": "head", "unitShort": "head", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11135, "unit": "head"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup flour (I used brown rice flour, but I have seen similar recipes where regular all purpose flour was used)", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "flour", "metaInformation": ["(I used brown rice flour, but I have seen similar recipes where regular all purpose flour was used)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 20081, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp finely minced fresh rosemary", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh rosemary", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "finely minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2063, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 clove garlic, crushed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "clove", "unitShort": "clove", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "clove"}, {"originalString": "\u00bc cup honey (or agave or maple syrup for strict vegan)", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "maple syrup", "metaInformation": ["for strict vegan)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19911, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup milk (I used almond milk)", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": ["(I used almond milk)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 grinds black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "\u00bc tsp salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 2047, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "2 Tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten free)", "aisle": "Condiments", "name": "soy sauce", "metaInformation": ["gluten free", "for )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "Tbsps", "unitShort": "Tbsp", "amount": 2.0, "id": 16124, "unit": "Tbsp"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 96.0, "sourceUrl": "http://cupcakesandkalechips.com/2014/01/26/balsamic-glazed-cauliflower-wings/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "aggregateLikes": 48261, "instructions": "Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl and whisk together.

Side Note: I cook the rice in chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor.While the rice is cooking, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.

Once the rice has cooked and cooled a bit, add the mushroom mixture and mix well. Scoop out a few tablespoons of the rice mixture to stuff into the chicken. Side Note: Serve the remaining rice mixture on the side with dinner.Make a small slit in the side of each chicken breast to form a pocket. Stuff the chicken breasts with the rice mixture. Use a toothpick to hold the stuffing in. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.In a measuring cup, combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, the chicken broth, and the mustard. Set aside.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large OVEN-SAFE skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the chicken into the hot oil and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until it has turned golden brown.  Flip the chicken then add the minced garlic and a dash of thyme to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Add the lemon juice mixture and stir, making sure to scrape any of the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Place the pan into the oven and bake 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.Remove pan from the oven then transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with an aluminum foil tent. Place the pan over medium heat and bring the liquid to a gentle boil.In a small bowl, use your fingers to mix the butter and flour together, making a dry, crumbly paste. Whisk the flour and butter into the sauce. The sauce will thicken slightly and look glossy. Remove from the heat then whisk in the sour cream. Taste and season with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, if needed. Place the chicken and it\u2019s juices back into the pan and coat with sauce.

Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot.    When the cream has come to a boil, pour over the chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth.    Stir in the vanilla.    To frost the cupcakes, dip them into the bowl of ganache.* Preheat oven to 350 F.    Place pretzels on baking sheets.    Unwrap candy kisses and place one in the center of each pretzel.    Place in preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until kisses melt.    Remove from oven and place one candy-coated chocolate in the center of each pretzel.

saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the glaze coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Strain through a sieve and reserve in a warm place until tuna burgers are cooked. (The glaze can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)Make the burgers: Grind the tuna in a meat grinder or chop with a large sharp knife to the texture of hamburger meat. (Do not use a food processor, which will shred the tuna rather than chop it.)Transfer the ground tuna to a bowl and combine with the garlic, mustard, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Divide the tuna into 4 equal portions. Using your hands, roll each part into a smooth ball and then flatten into a compact patty.Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and sear the tuna burgers until browned and medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes a side. Serve each burger on a buttered toasted bun and spread with a tablespoon of warm glaze. Garnish the burgers with equal amounts of pickled ginger slices.

together all the ingredients, except the canola oil. Shape heaping teaspoons of the mixture into 1-inch balls. In a Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, wiping pan in between, saute the meatballs, turning frequently for even browning, until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Place on a paper towel-lined plate.                                                To make the sauce:                                        Heat oil in the same Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and cook 1 minute. Stir in the remaining ingredients and reduce heat to low.Add the browned meatballs to the Dutch oven and toss gently to coat with sauce.

seven ingredients in a stockpot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add beef and rice.                                                                                           In a small bowl, combine flour and milk until smooth. Stir into the soup.

Drain two-thirds of the rhubarb from itssyrup. To make the fool, whip the cream and sugar together, then fold half into the custard. Fold in the rhubarb so the mix is swirled pink. Spoon the mix on top of the shortbread, then spoon the rest of the cream around the edge of the bowl. Use a slotted spoon to lift the remaining rhubarb into the middle of the trifle. Serve with the syrup in a separate jug.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes. I use the \"bread proof\" oven setting.While the dough is rising, you can make the caramel sauce. In a medium pan, melt butter, sugar, and almonds over medium high heat until bubbly. Allow to bubble for 2 minutes stirring constantly, then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Bring to a boil one more time, and then remove from the heat and set aside.After the dough has doubled in size, scoop it out onto a well floured surface and roll into a rectangle about 18 inches on the long side.Brush the dough with melted butter and sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar.Roll the dough starting with the long end, tightening the roll as you go. Using a serrated knife, or a piece of dental floss, cut the roll of dough in half, and then again. Cut each quarter into four sections, so you have 16 total.Prepare two pans by lining them with parchment paper. I used a 9 by 9 inch square baking dish, as well as an 8 inch round dish. Pour half of the caramel almond sauce into each pan and spread to the edges. Place the uncooked rolls into each pan, leaving space in between.Cover the rolls with a clean kitchen towel, and put them in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes.

Mix the sugar and salt with 8 cups (2 quarts) water in a large container until dissolved. Add the chicken wings and brine for 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerated.Place the wood chips in a smoker box and place the smoker box directly on a burner on the grill, under the grate. Cover, turn the burner under the smoker box to high and heat until the chips start to smoke, 5 to 10 minutes. Once smoking, turn off that burner, turn the other burners to low and heat until the thermometer registers 275 degrees F.Dry the chicken pieces with a paper towel and season with cracked black pepper. Add the chicken to the grill over the set burners, close the lid and smoke the wings, maintaining a grill temperature of 250 to 275 degrees F and turning the wings once, until the meat registers 165 to 170 degrees F, about 1 hour. Raise the set burners to medium high and sear both sides of the wings until golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side.Immediately toss the wings with some of the Tangy Honey Mustard BBQ Sauce, then sprinkle with the crushed pretzels to add some crunch and serve!                                                Tangy Honey Mustard BBQ Sauce:                                        Mix together the yellow and stone-ground mustard, vinegar, honey, brown sugar, Worcestershire and granulated garlic. Season with plenty of freshly cracked pepper.

and cayenne. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Cover and refrigerate while you prepare the slaw.For the slaw: In a dry saute pan over medium-high heat, toast the almonds until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Shake the pan to ensure even cooking. Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, combine the broccoli, the green and red cabbage, and the fennel, carrot and onion. Toss well to combine. Add the dressing and toss to coat the vegetables thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes to allow the vegetables time to soften.Sprinkle with the toasted almonds just before serving.

Line large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.In a large bowl (of a stand mixer or with a handheld electric mixer), beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar together until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase the mixer speed to medium and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute longer. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on medium-low until well mixed, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again. Add the flour mixture and mix until barely incorporated, 10-20 seconds. It's ok if there are a few dry spots. Gradually add the oats and mix until well-combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minutes. If needed, give the dough a final stir with a wooden spoon to ensure that no flour pockets remain and that the ingredients are evenly distributed.Scoop out about 2 tablespoon-sized mounds of dough and roll them to form balls. Place the cookies about 2 1/2-inches apart on the baking sheet(s) - about 8 cookies per sheet. They will spread quite a bit. Lightly press each cookie to about 3/4-inch thickness (I found after baking one sheet of these that I didn't need to press them at all so use your best cookie judgment). Bake 1 sheet of cookies at a time until the cookies are golden brown, edges are crisp, and centers are still very slightly soft, 13 to 16 minutes. Cooling the cookies completely on the baking sheet will yield crispier, more perfect cookies.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/thin-and-crispy-oatmeal-cookies-568662", "vegetarian":
