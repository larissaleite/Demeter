In a small saucepan, combine the water, 1 \u00bd cups sugar, and corn syrup over medium-low heat. Stir frequently until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once this occurs, attach a candy thermometer, raise the heat to medium, and stop stirring. Bring the mixture to 240 degrees F on the thermometer. In the meantime, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on medium-high until they become frothy. Once this happens, add the cream of tartar. Continue whipping until soft peaks form; then add 2 teaspoons sugar and whip until stiff, but not dry peaks form. Timing is tricky. If the egg whites look done before the syrup, stop them for a few moments, then begin whipping again when the syrup is almost done. If the syrup is close to done before the egg whites, turn the heat down to low. Raise it when the whites are ready.Once the syrup is at 240 and the egg whites are whipped, turn the mixer to low and slowly drizzle the syrup into the egg whites while still bubbling hot. Try not to get the syrup on the side of the bowl.

Butter 2 8 or 9 inch round cake pans. Line bottoms of pans with parchment. Butter and flour parchment and pan, making sure to tap out any excess flour.In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a large bowl, combine sugars and butter until light and fluffy, using wooden spoon or spatula. If butter is truly room temperature machinery should not be necessary. Add eggs and vanilla, stirring to fully combine. Alternately add flour mixture and milk, beginning and ending with flour. You should add flour in 3 installments and milk in 2. Stir the batter until just combined. Fold in the peaches. Divide the batter as evenly as possible between the 2 pans. Bake for about 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool cakes completely in pans.Make the peach puree. Combine peaches and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently. Cook until the mixture is bubbling and has thickened juices, about five minutes. Remove from heat to cool slightly. Pour peach mixture into bowl of food processor. Process until the mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute. Pour mixture into a bowl and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours and up to 2 days to cool and thicken.Make the frosting. In a small saucepan, combine the water, 1 \u00bd cups sugar, and corn syrup over medium-low heat. Stir frequently until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once this occurs, attach a candy thermometer, raise the heat to medium, and stop stirring. Bring the mixture to 240 degrees F on the thermometer. In the meantime, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on medium-high until they become frothy. Once this happens, add the cream of tartar. Continue whipping until soft peaks form; then add 2 teaspoons sugar and whip until stiff, but not dry peaks form. Timing is tricky. If the egg whites look done before the syrup, stop them for a few moments, then begin whipping again when the syrup is almost done. If the syrup is close to done before the egg whites, turn the heat down to low.
