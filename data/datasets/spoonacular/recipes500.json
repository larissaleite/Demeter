Stir in frozen peas. Season to taste and transfer mixture to large bowl. Cover and chill until just cool, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and place pizza stone on rack. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F for 45 minutes.                                                                                                                             8                                                                            On lightly floured surface, roll out larger piece of dough to 14-inch circle. Roll up dough with rolling pin and then unroll over souffle dish, allowing dough to fit into bottom and completely up the sides. If very soft, chill dough in dish until dough is firm, about 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Fill crust with cooled chicken filling. Roll out remaining piece of dough to 9-inch circle and place over the top. Press the edges together, trim, and crimp with fork.                                                                                                                             10                                                                            In small bowl, whisk yolk and remaining 2 teaspoons milk. Brush over top crust. Poke a few slits into the top of the crust. Place a piece of parchment paper on the pizza stone and place the pot pie on top.                                                                                                                              11                                                                            Reduce heat to 375\u00b0F.
