Place a cake layer on a serving plate, spread with the filling, and top with the second cake layer. Refrigerate while preparing the glaze.To make the glaze: In the top of a double boiler, combine the chocolate, sugar, and water and place over barely simmering water until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 15 to 30 minutes.    Pour the glaze over the cake, allowing a little to drip over the sides. Refrigerate until chilled. Boston cream pie is best the day it is made, but can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Remove the cake from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before serving.Boston Cream Cupcakes: Divide the batter between 12 (2\u00bd-inch) cupcake tins, filling no more than three-quarters full, and bake at 350\u00b0F (325\u00b0F for a convection oven) for about 20 minutes. After cooling, cut horizontally in half, fill with the custard, and pour the glaze over top.Richer Cake: In the batter, substitute 3 large egg yolks for the egg and increase the butter to \u00bd cup (1 stick/4 ounces/115 grams) and the sugar to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces/225 grams). In the glaze, omit the sugar and water, increase the butter to \u00bc cup (\u00bd stick/2 ounces/55 grams), and add 1\u00bd tablespoons light corn syrup.Decorated Top: Combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon water, and 1 teaspoon light corn syrup. Spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8-inch round tip. After covering the cake with the chocolate glaze and before it sets, start from the center and pipe spiral rings. Using the tip of a knife or skewer and starting from the center, pull parallel lines outward to the edge.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/american-cakes-boston-cream-pie-533779",
