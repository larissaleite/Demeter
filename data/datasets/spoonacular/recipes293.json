Sprinkle the espresso powder over top and stir to dissolve. Add the cinnamon, ginger and salt. Stir in the vanilla.Pour the warm mixture over the dry oat mixture and stir to fully combine. I normally stir for a good 3 to 5 minutes.Spread the granola out on a parchment lined baking sheet with sides and drizzle with 2 tablespoons honey. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes stirring every 15 minutes so the granola will get evenly toasted. The last time you stir the granola drizzle it with the remaining 2 tablespoons honey. Remove from the oven and let cool five minutes. Up the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.After 5 minutes spray the bottom of a flat 1 cup measuring cup or a flat bottomed glass with cooking spray. Press the granola into the pan using the bottom of the measuring cup so that you have a flat slab of granola that looks like they could be cut into bars. Let the granola sit for one hour to cool and harden. After an hour break the granola up into clusters.While the granola cools bake the gingerbread cookies. Remove the pans from the fridge and bake the cookies just until they're slightly brown around the edges 8 to 12 minutes, or until they feel firm. Let the cookies cool completely before tossing with the granola.When everything is cool toss about half the cookies or however many you wish with the granola.

Bake in preheated oven about 12 minutes until cookies are nearly set (you don't want to pull them out before they are done or they'll taste raw, not a cookie you want to under-bake. The top layer of the cookie should be cooked through). Allow to cool several minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Store in a single layer in an airtight container (these are best once they've rested in an airtight container a few hours, they soften throughout).Recipe Source: adapted slightly from allrecipes.com", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-cookies-676174", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 30, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Casaveneracion", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sausage--pasta--tomato-and-cabbage-soup-523213.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 523213, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sausage, pasta, tomato and cabbage soup", "preparationMinutes": 10, "pricePerServing": 236.71, "creditText": "Casaveneracion", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "6 to 8 c. of good quality broth (see homemade broth)", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "broth", "metaInformation": ["homemade", "(see broth)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1006615, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "about 4 c. of shredded cabbage", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cabbage", "metaInformation": ["shredded"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cabbage.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 11109, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "a can of stewed or diced tomatoes", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 10011693, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "about 1 c. of cubed carrots", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "carrots", "metaInformation": ["cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11124, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "2 pinches of dried oregano", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "dried oregano", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg", "unitLong": "pinches", "unitShort": "pinches", "amount": 2.0, "id": 2027, "unit": "pinches"}, {"originalString": "about 100 g. of sausages (garlicky and salty work best), casings discarded", "aisle": "Meat", "name": "elk sausages", "metaInformation": ["(garlicky and salty work best)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 100.0, "id": 10017338, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "2 tbsps. of olive oil (optional if your sausages are fatty)", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "olive oil", "metaInformation": ["(optional if your sausages are fatty)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 4053, "unit": "tbsps"}, {"originalString": "1/2 c. of chopped onions", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onions", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11282, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "about 90 g. of pasta, any shape", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "pasta", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg", "unitLong": "grams", "unitShort": "g", "amount": 90.0, "id": 20420, "unit": "g"}, {"originalString": "salt and pepper, to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt and pepper", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "id": 2047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "parsley or sweet basil, or both, to garnish", "aisle": "?", "name": "both", "metaInformation": ["sweet"], "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "unit": "servings"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 82.0, "sourceUrl": "http://casaveneracion.com/sausage-pasta-tomato-and-cabbage-soup/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Half-cook the pasta in plenty of salted water then drain.
