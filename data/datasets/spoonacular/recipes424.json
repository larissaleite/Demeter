Remove the chicken or shrimp from the marinade. Pan-cook the chicken for 7 minutes a side or until cooked through; the shelled shrimp until pink and cooked through on both sides. Slice the chicken into long strips with the crisped skin and throw them into the bowl; the shrimp can go in whole.Make the dressing5. Peel the citrus fruits thinly with a potato peeler so that you end up with no pith.6. Put the slices of peel with the juice of the fruit in a pan with the garlic, ginger, and honey. Bring to a boil and reduce by a half until you have a lovely, syrupy sauce.7. Strain it into a bowl through a strainer, add the olive oil until you have a dressing you like the taste of, then add the finely chopped piece of ginger and its syrup and season to taste.8. Throw half the roughly chopped cilantro and mint into the salad, add the dressing, and toss with your hands to amalgamate everything well. Throw in the rest of the herbs and serve.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/asian-noodle-salad-597440", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "salad", "main course", "main dish",
