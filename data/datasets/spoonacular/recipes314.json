Continue to braise, uncovered, until the ribs are tender, 15 to 20 more minutes. Return the pot to the stovetop and transfer the ribs to a plate. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat; skim off the fat and cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Return the ribs to the pot and heat through. Discard the bay leaves and thyme.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pork                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ribs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Easy                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li ><a href=\"/content/food/topics/p/pork-shoulder-recipes.html\">Pork</a></li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/o/onion.html\">Onion</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/r/ribs.html\">Ribs</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Cooking Style</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/e/easy.html\">Easy</a></li>                                 </ul></div>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/beer-braised-country-style-pork-ribs-375953", "dishTypes": ["lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 135, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}]}
