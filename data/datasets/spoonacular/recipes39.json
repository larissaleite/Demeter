You want them to be dry by the time you are ready to cook, without breaking them by prodding with a towel.In large nonstick or cast iron skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over a medium flame. Saute the onion slowly until translucent and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and corn and continue to saute until the corn is bright yellow and tender, about 5 minutes. Add the cumin, turmeric, and salt. Cook for another few minutes until the corn is beginning to caramelize. Turn the heat down to low and add the tomatoes. Stir slowly until the tomatoes heated through, but have not begun to release their juices, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon and the basil off the heat, and transfer to a platter.In a large nonstick or cast iron skillet (you can remove the corn mixture to a platter, clean out the pan and use it for the scallops), heat one tablespoon of olive oil over a high flame. Once the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the butter. Gently pat the scallops with a paper towel to make sure they are nice and dry and season them with salt on one side. When the butter is melted and the pan is smoking, add the scallops, making sure not to crowd the pan (you will likely need to do this in 2 or 3 batches). Turn the pan to keep the butter and oil evenly distributed, but DO NOT move the scallops until they have properly browned, about 2-3 minutes depending on the size of your scallops. When they have a good sear (dark brown crust), flip them and cook for another minute. The scallops should still be slightly translucent in the center\u2013if they are opaque throughout, they will likely be overcooked by the time you serve them. Remove finished scallops to the corn platter, making sure to put the beautiful seared side facing up. Repeat with the remaining scallops.Squeeze a little extra lemon juice over the scallops and garnish with julienned basil.

Have a pastry bag with a large plain tip ready; you can lightly spray the inside of the pastry bag with vegetable cooking spray to help keep the sticky p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux paste from clinging the inside of the bag.Place the water, salt, sugar and butter in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Stir the mixture until the butter is fully melted.Turn off the heat and immediately add the flour. Vigorously stir the dough with a spoon by hand. Turn on the heat to medium and continue stirring the bough until it comes away from the sides of the pan. The dough should look relatively dry and should just begin to leave a film on the sauce pan.Transfer the dough to a bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle, slowly stir and allow it to cool briefly to about 130\u00b0F or below to prevent the eggs from curdling when added.Begin beating in the eggs one at a time, until each egg is fully incorporated. Continue to add the eggs one by one until the mixture is shiny but firm. It may not be necessary to add all of the eggs; too many will create a runny dough. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl in thick threads; it will not clear the bowl. The dough should not be runny; it should be easy to control when piped and hold it\u2019s shape.Add a workable amount of dough into the pastry bag and pipe onto the sheet pan, creating a 1.5 inch circular ball of dough. Dip your finger in water and flatten any \u201ctails\u201d left on the ball when piping to create a smoother surface. Pipe the balls 2 inches apart from each other; they will expand to about 2 inches after baking.Bake as follows to create a dry and hollow cream puff shell: Bake for 10 minutes at each temperature setting; 425\u00b0F > 375\u00b0F > 325\u00b0F > 275\u00b0F > 225\u00b0F > 200\u00b0F. Open the oven door as little as possible to prevent rapid changes in the oven\u2019s temperature.Break open a pastry to ensure that baking is complete; you want the pastry to be as dry as possible on the inside. If needed, continue to bake the p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux at 200\u00b0F until dry in the center; they should feel light in weight when you pick them up. (Note: This baking method will work the best if you bake one tray at a time.)Cool completely and reserve until ready to fill. The p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux can be frozen or stored at room temperature for 3 days.Once filled, the cream puffs should be served the same day, as they will get soggy from the filling.In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, bring the half-and-half and vanilla just to a boil.Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Temper the egg mixture with approximately one-third of the hot half-and-half, then return the entire mixture to the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half.Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not allow the sauce to boil.As soon as the sauce thickens, remove it from the heat. Add the instant coffee and Irish cream to the sauce, and stir until fully incorporated. Taste the sauce and adjust the coffee and Irish cream to your liking.Pour the sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. Chill the sauce over an ice bath, then cover and keep refrigerated. The sauce should last 3 to 4 days. Place cream in a chilled mixing bowl, using a balloon whisk, whisk until the cream is slightly thickened.Add the sugar, Irish cream and dissolved coffee to the mixer, and continue whisking until smooth medium-stiff peaks are formed, being carefully not to over mix. The cream should be smooth and light, not grainy. The whipped cream may be stored in the refrigerator for a few hours. If the cream begins to soften, gently rewhip if necessary.Add the cream to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. You can use a large ziplock bag a cut a small opening in the corner to pipe if you do not have a piping bag.In a medium saucepan combine the heavy cream, vanilla and salt. Heat the cream over medium heat until just boiling, about 2 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and whiskey, and whisk until smooth.Use immediately, or set aside to cool completely, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.To serve, reheat gently over simmering water.Cut the profiterole shell in half. Fill the bottom the shell with the whipped cream. Dip the top of the shell in the chocolate, then place on top of the filled shell.

Drain the mushrooms. Remove and discard the stems; finely chop the caps.

Gently mix and squeeze until well combined. Use a generous 2 tablespoons each to shape the mixture into 24 meatballs. Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.To prepare glaze: Combine mirin (or sherry), soy sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar and ginger in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the cornstarch-water mixture, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, 2 to 5 minutes.To prepare kebabs: Preheat half to two-thirds of a gas grill to medium-high (1 burner if you have a 2-burner grill; 2 burners on a 3-burner grill) or build a medium-high-heat fire on one side of a charcoal grill.Thread the meatballs onto flat metal skewers, 4 per skewer. Oil the grill rack (see Tips). Grill the kebabs over direct heat, turning once, until marked, 5 to 6 minutes per side. (If you try to turn the kebabs too early, the meatballs will stick to the grill. Let them cook for a minute or two longer before turning so the meat will release from the grill.) Move the kebabs to the unlit side. Brush the tops with the glaze and grill for 2 minutes. Turn the kebabs over, brush with more glaze and grill for about 2 minutes more. Remove to a clean large serving platter; tent with foil to keep warm.Grill scallions over direct heat, lightly brushing them with some of the glaze and turning frequently so the glaze doesnt burn, until tender-crisp and with a few char marks, 2 to 3 minutes total.

                                    Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Toss cherries in 13- by 9-inch ceramic or glass baking dish with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Roast until juices stack in high bubbles and cherries offer no resistance to a paring knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside to cool.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            When cherries are cool enough to handle, cut in half to remove pits. Transfer to blender and scrape in cherry juices. Add half and half, egg yolks, and sugar, and blend on high until very smooth.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Pour mixture through a stainer into a medium saucepan and place on medium-low heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until lightly thickened. Custard should coat back of a wooden spoon and a finger swiped through coating should leave a clean line, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt to taste. Strain into an airtight container and chill over night.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            The next day, churn ice cream according to manufacturer's instructions.

Have a kettle of boiling water ready.Add heavy cream, coconut milk, and coconut extract to a small saucepan. Stir to incorporate and set over medium heat. Warm the mixture until bubbles form around the edges and steam begins to rise to the surface.Remove from heat and let sit for 15 minutes to cool down a bit.In the meantime, in a heatproof glass bowl, whisk together egg yolks and \u00bd cup of granulated sugar. Whisk until mixture is pale yellow. This will take about 5 minutes of heavy whisking. See notes below on how to create a less airy mixture.Once the mixture is ready, temper the yolk mixture by adding a small ladle of the cream mixture to the yolk mixture and stir it gently. Once the yolk mixture is tempered, you can pour the remaining cream mixture to the yolk mixture.Divide the custard amongst porcelain ramekins (I used two 5\u00be-ounce round ramekins and two cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes).Place ramekins in a baking pan and pour the boiling water into the baking pan halfway up the ramekins, carefully making sure none of the water drips into the ramekins.Loosely cover the baking pan with foil then carefully place into the oven.Bake until the custards are just set around the edges, about 50 minutes. This will vary greatly depending on the depth and size of your ramekins.Let custards cool in baking pan until able to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Once cooled, cover each with plastic wrap and place into refrigerator to set overnight.Prior to serving, sprinkle a heavy amount of granulated sugar on top and using a kitchen torch, carefully melt the sugar on top to your liking. Once the sugar hardens, you can eat!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/coconut-crme-brle-606392", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 1515, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Farm Girls Dabbles", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mini-Phyllo-Cups-with-Whipped-Goat-Cheese--Grapes--and-Thyme-497746.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 497746, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Mini Phyllo Cups with Whipped Goat Cheese, Grapes, and Thyme", "creditText": "A Farm Girls Dabbles", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 30.0, "id": 1002030, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "4 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 4.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "2 boxes Athens Mini Fillo Shells (3o shells total)", "aisle": "Frozen", "name": "fillo shells", "metaInformation": ["mini", "(3o shells total)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mini-phyllo-shells.png", "unitLong": "boxes", "unitShort": "boxes", "amount": 2.0, "id": 93817, "unit": "boxes"}, {"originalString": "1 T. chopped fresh thyme", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "fresh thyme", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2049, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "6 oz. goat cheese", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "goat cheese", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/goat-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1159, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "2 T. half and half", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "half and half", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1049, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "2 T. honey", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "honey", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 19296, "unit": "T"}, {"originalString": "15 large red seedless grapes, quartered", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red grapes", "metaInformation": ["red", "seedless", "large", "quartered"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-grapes.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 15.0, "id": 9132, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 12.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/2013/12/13/mini-phyllo-cups-with-whipped-goat-cheese-grapes-and-thyme-recipe/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "aggregateLikes": 4085, "instructions": "Remove Athens Mini Fillo Shells from boxes and set on counter, with the phyllo shells still in their protective tray.With an electric mixer, whip goat cheese and cream cheese in a medium bowl on high speed.

Add the oregano and peperoncini and chop everything together. Put the mixture in a bowl, stir in the oil, season with salt and pepper, and reserve.                                                                 Preheat an outdoor charcoal or gas grill or a grill pan until smoking hot.                                                                Put enough eggplant slices on the grill to cover it without crowding. Cook the eggplant until well marked, 3 to 6 minutes, then turn the slices over. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove the eggplant from the grill.                                                                 Pour the vinegar into a shallow bowl. While still hot, dip each eggplant slice into the vinegar and set it aside on a plate. Continue grilling and dipping the eggplant until all the slices are cooked and seasoned.                                                                Spoon 2 tablespoons of the parsley mixture onto a platter and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon. Arrange half of the grilled eggplant on the parsley in a single layer. Smear each slice of eggplant with more parsley. Place a second layer of eggplant on top and spread the remaining parsley on it. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and set aside to marinate at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate for longer). Serve at room temperature.                                                            Chef's notes:                You could make the parsley mixture in a food processor, but I don't. I find hand chopping gives me the somewhat drier texture I prefer.                                                                For this recipe, I don't salt or oil the eggplant; I grill it dry. This way, it has a nice chewy texture. I marinate the eggplant as soon as it comes off the grill so the flavor of the marinade penetrates.
