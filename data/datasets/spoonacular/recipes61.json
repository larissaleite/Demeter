Combine 3/4 cup rice vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 1 tablespoon ginger, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, crushed red pepper and salt in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the salt is dissolved, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Let cool for 2 minutes. Pour over the cabbage and stir well. Cover and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for least 2 hours and up to 1 day.To marinate steak: Combine soy sauce, 1/4 cup vinegar, sesame oil, scallions, 1 1/2 tablespoons ginger, sugar, garlic and chile paste to taste in a shallow glass dish. Add steak, cover and marinate in the refrigerator, turning once or twice, for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.To prepare filling & cabbage shells: Combine 1 cup water, rice and 1/4 teaspoon canola oil in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir well, reduce heat to maintain the barest simmer, cover and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Set aside, covered.Remove the outermost leaves from red cabbage, cut the head in half through the core and remove the core from each half. Peel leaves from each half and select 8 good-looking ones to use for the taco shells. Thinly slice enough of the remaining cabbage to get 4 cups.Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and a pinch of salt; cook, stirring frequently, until softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the sliced red cabbage and 1 tablespoon ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage starts to wilt, about 5 minutes more. Set aside.When youre ready to cook the steak, preheat a grill to medium-high. (Or position an oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat source and preheat broiler to high.)Remove the steak from the marinade; reserve the marinade. Grill (or broil), turning once, 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare skirt steak or 9 to 12 minutes for medium-rare flank steak. Transfer to a clean cutting board, tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes.Add the marinade to the red cabbage mixture in the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

                          In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil and heat to a shimmer. Add Trisha's Pulled Pork, the chili powder, garlic powder, salt, cumin and black pepper; stir to combine. Add enough reserved cooking liquid to coat the meat but not saturate it. Cook until the meat starts to brown and the spices become fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and hold.Place a Grit Cake on each serving plate and top with some pork, Corn Salsa, sour cream, chopped green onions and cilantro.                                                Trisha's Pulled Pork:                                        Season the ribs well on all sides with salt and pepper.In a large Dutch oven over high heat, heat the oil to a shimmer. Add the ribs and sear until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the ribs and transfer to a plate. Add the garlic, carrots and onion and cook until golden and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of water and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add 2 more cups of water and stir to combine.Return the ribs to the Dutch oven, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook until fork-tender, about 3 hours.Remove the ribs from the liquid and transfer to a baking sheet to cool. Strain the cooking liquid and reserve. When cool enough to handle, use 2 forks to shred the pork.Yield: about 2 pounds                                                Grit  Cakes:                                        Line an 8-by-10-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving any excess hanging off the sides, and spray with cooking spray.In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the vegetable broth, grits and salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the grits are thickened and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold in the cheese. Pour the grits into the prepared pan and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.Using a round cutter or a knife, cut the grits into 2 1/2-inch cakes.In a large skillet, heat the oil to a shimmer and add the cakes. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.                                                Corn Salsa:                                        In a medium skillet over high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the corn and cook until beginning to caramelize, about 4 minutes. Add the salsa and enough broth, starting with a 1/4 cup, to make it thick yet pourable. Serve warm.

Break the graham crackers into pieces, then pulse in a food processor with the sugar until finely ground; drizzle in the melted butter and pulse to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1 inch up the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.Make the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and slightly fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the lemon juice and vanilla.Pour the batter into the prepared crust. Transfer to the oven and bake until the edge is set but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Turn off the oven and keep the cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar, 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake to loosen. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely, then refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or overnight.Top with homemade fruit sauce (see below).                                                            Rasberry-RoseCombine 3 cups raspberries, 1 1/2 cups rose wine, 1 cup sugar, 1 strip orange zest, the juice of 1 orange, 2 teaspoons vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, 30 to 40 minutes. Whisk 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water; whisk into the sauce until thickened, 3 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, using a ladle to push it through. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate. (Makes 1 1/2 cups.)Honeydew-AvocadoPuree 2 cups cubed honeydew melon, 1 small peeled and pitted avocado, 1/3 cup sugar and the juice of 1 lime until smooth. If the sauce is still lumpy, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, using a ladle to push it through. Cover and refrigerate. (Makes 1 3/4 cups.)Mango-CoconutCombine 2 cups coconut water and 1/2 cup sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally; cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 2 chopped mangoes and cook until just tender, 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the juice of 1 lime and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Puree until smooth, then strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, using a ladle to push it through. Let cool; cover and refrigerate. (Makes 1 3/4 cups.)Maple-BlueberryCombine 3 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, 1 cup water, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup sugar, the juice of 1 lemon and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then lower the heat and simmer until reduced by half, 20 to 30 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, using a ladle to push it through. Let cool; cover and refrigerate. (Makes 1 3/4 cups.)Strawberry-RhubarbToss 2 cups sliced fresh or frozen rhubarb, 1 pound quartered strawberries and 3/4 cup sugar in a saucepan; let sit until juicy, 20 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, using a ladle to push it through. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate. (Makes 1 1/2 cups.)Apricot-GingerCombine 1 cup dried apricots, 1/3 cup sugar, 3 thin slices ginger, 1 1/4 cups water, 1/2 cup cranberry juice and the juice of 2 lemons in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the apricots are very soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool; discard the ginger. Puree until smooth, then cover and refrigerate. Stir in up to 1/2 cup water if the sauce seems thick.

Place 4 slices, butter-chip mixture side down, on your work surface. Spread 2 tablespoons of the guacamole on each slice of bread. Sprinkle the tomato on top of the guacamole, if using. Follow with the Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses. Dot with small pieces of the goat cheese. Finish by placing two bacon pieces on each sandwich.

Put the sandwiches into the pan, cover, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the undersides are golden brown. Watch carefully because the chips in the butter can burn easily. Turn the sandwiches, pressing each one firmly with a spatula to compress the filling slightly. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the undersides are well browned. Turn the sandwiches once more, press firmly with the spatula again, cook for 1 minute, and remove from the pan. Let cool 5 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and let cook/bubble for 1 minute, stirring once or twice to avoid burning. Gradually whisk in the milk and raise the heat up to medium-high. Bring the mixture to a boil, whisking frequently until the sauce has thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in all of the cheese, pesto, mustard powder, cayenne, salt and pepper. Stir until the cheese is fully melted (if needed, return the pot to the heat to fully melt the cheese). Stir in the pasta + cherry tomatoes and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Evenly layer the sliced tomatoes on top of the pasta. Sprinkle on the toasted cracker crumbs and place the baking dish onto a baking sheet.

You'll have 6 pieces to work with for each sheet of Puff Pastry.3. Assemble turnovers: Lay graham cracker on 1/2 of each square, top with chocolate that has been cut down to match the length of the graham cracker. Scoop a scant 1 Tablespoon peanut butter on top of each chocolate bar.4. Working with one turnover at a time, wet edges of Puff Pastry and fold (over) in half to meet opposite edges. Gently push edges together to stick; use fork to seal edges together and create ridged pattern. Repeat with each turnover until all are sealed up. Gently move sealed turnovers to baking sheet with a small spatula. (At this point, the turnovers may be refrigerated for up to an hour before baking- cover baking sheet with plastic wrap- when ready to bake, remove from refrigerator and continue with instructions).5. Brush turnovers lightly with egg wash, then use a sharp knife to cut two small slits into the top of each turnover.6. Bake 15 minutes, or until turnovers are puffed and golden. Remove from oven.

Add to chili/chickpea/tomato water mixture.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Heat oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and dried oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pureed chilies, soy sauce, and marmite and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add reserved chili/chickpea/tomato water mixture and stir to combine. Add chopped chickpeas and kidney beans. Stir to combine.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            If beans are sticking out of the top, add reserved kidney bean liquid until just barely submerged. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and rich, about 1 1/2 hours, adding more reserved kidney bean liquid as necessary if chili becomes too thick or sticks to the bottom of the pan.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            When cooked, add vodka or bourbon and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and whisk in masa in a slow steady stream until desired thickness is reached. For best results, allow chili to cool and refrigerate for at least one night and up to a week. Reheat to serve.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Serve, garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, avocado, lime wedges, and warm tortillas as desired.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/the-best-vegetarian-bean-chili-195314", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Buns in My Oven", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/cinnamon-roll-fried-donuts-724271.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 724271, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Cinnamon Roll Fried Donuts", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Buns in My Oven", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tablespoon cinnamon", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cinnamon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 2010, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "1 tube Pillsbury Crescent Rounds", "aisle": "Refrigerated", "name": "crescent roll", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crescent-rolls.jpg", "unitLong": "tube", "unitShort": "tube", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93618, "unit": "tube"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "oil, for frying", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "oil", "metaInformation": ["for frying"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 4582, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup powdered sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "powdered sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 19336, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19335, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 3.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.bunsinmyoven.com/2016/03/24/cinnamon-roll-fried-donuts/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 8, "aggregateLikes": 137, "instructions": "Heat oil to 375 degrees.Place crescent rounds into hot oil, 1 at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.

Special equipment: 1 box fan, 4 paper air-conditioning filters, 2 bungee cords, 6 (14 by 14-inch) plastic dehydrator sheetsIn a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice and water. Set aside until ready to use.Peel, core and dice the fruit into 1/2-inch cubes, with the exception of the strawberries.  Slice the strawberries 1/8 of an inch thick. Place the fruit into the lemon water and allow to soak for up to 2 minutes. Remove and drain thoroughly.Lay 1 (14 by 14-inch) plastic dehydrator sheet on 1 of the air-conditioning filters. Place the fruit on the plastic dehydrator sheet and cover with another plastic sheet. Repeat this process with remaining plastic sheets and two more filters, stacking on top of the first one. Top these with the remaining empty filter. Next, lay the box fan on its side and lay the filters on top of it. Strap the filters to the fan with two bungee cords. Stand the fan upright, plug in and set to high. Dry for 42 to 48 hours. When dry, the fruit should be pliable but not sticky. You should not be able to squeeze moisture from the fruit. If using a commercial dehydrator, follow the manufacturer's directions.Remove the fruit from filters and store in an airtight container in a cool dry place.

Prepare the dough:  Heat the eggnog and butter in a glass cup in the microwave until the butter is melted (you can also heat these in a pan on the stove, if desired).  Cool to 110 to 115 degrees F (about as warm as you'd like a bath to be- if you don't have a thermometer).  In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warmed eggnog mixture with the yeast.  Let sit for a minute or two, then add the egg, 2 cups of flour, salt and nutmeg.  Use the dough hook of your mixer to combine the ingredients.  Add remaining flour (up to 3 cups), 1/2 cup at a time while the dough hook is stirring.  Stop the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl, as needed.  The dough hook should be pulling the dough up out of the bowl and away from the sides.  If it's still too sticky, add additional flour by the tablespoon until you get the desired consistency.  Let the dough hook knead the dough for 5 minutes.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and work with your hands a little bit to form a smooth, round ball.  Coat a large bowl with nonstick spray.  Place dough in the bowl and turn it over to coat with the spray.  Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel.  Place it in a warm place to rise until the dough doubles in size- about 1 hour (see tips below).  2.  Prepare the Ooey Gooey stuff:  In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Place the melted butter in a separate bowl.3.  Form the bread balls:  Spray a bundt pan with nonstick spray.  Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat it into an 8-inch square.  Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut the dough into 64 pieces (cut the square into 4 pieces, then cut each piece into 16 pieces).  Roll each small piece into a ball.  Dip a ball in the melted butter, then roll in the brown sugar mixture; place it into the bundt pan.  Continue with the remaining 63 pieces of dough, layering the balls as they accumulate in the bundt pan.  If you have any melted butter left over, drizzle a couple of tablespoons over the layered dough balls.  Cover the bundt pan with a clean dish towel, and place it back into a warm place to rise for about another hour.  They should get slightly puffier.4.  Ready to bake:  Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. (if you're using the oven as a warming place, take out the bundt pan before you preheat the oven!)  Remove the dishtowel.  Bake about 30 minutes, or until the top has browned and ooey gooey caramel is bubbling around the edges. Cool in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip the bundt pan upside down onto a platter to remove the contents of the pan.  Let it sit on the platter for a few minutes to cool slightly before glazing.5.  Prepare the glaze:  Whisk together the powdered sugar, eggnog and nutmeg.  Spoon the glaze over the top and sides of the monkey bread.

Line baking sheet(s) with parchment paper; set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, and salt; set aside.In a large bowl, or the bowl of a standing mixer, beat the butter until creamy. Gradually beat in the sugar until well combined and light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time (scraping the bowl between additions, as needed), until fully incorporated. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture and mix until just combined, followed by half of the milk, mixing until just combined.

Stir in vanilla and almond extracts until combined, being careful not to overmix.Drop the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the prepared baking sheet(s), leaving 2 inches between the cookies. Bake until centers are firm and edges just begin to brown, 15-18 minutes. Cool the cookies for 2 minutes on the sheet before transferring to a wire cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before icing. Once the cookies are completely cooled, flip them over.To make the icing: Melt the chocolate in a small bowl and set aside.In a small saucepan set over medium high heat, bring the water and honey to a boil. Remove from heat and add half of the mixture into the sugar. Whisk until fully incorporated and smooth, adding more of the honey mixture, 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed. Stir in the vanilla extract. Add extra liquid very slowly to be sure that the icing doesn\u2019t get runny.Fill a decorating bag with a small amount of icing and snip off the end. Draw a straight line directly across the center of the bottom of each cookie. Return any extra icing to the bowl. Using a small offset spatula, spread vanilla icing over half of each cookie, filling it in up to the line.Once all of the cookie have vanilla icing, stir the melted chocolate into the remaining vanilla icing.
