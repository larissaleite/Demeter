Let cool to room temperature.                                                                 In a container that holds at least 9 quarts, combine the honey mixture, rum, lemon juice, Chartreuse, water, and bitters and stir until thoroughly blended. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours.                                                                 To serve, pour the mixture into one or more punch bowls. Pour in the ginger ale and stir gently. Add the ice and garnish with lemon wheels, mint sprigs, and edible flowers. Ladle into tiki mugs.                                                NOTE:            Want to set this baby on fire? Here's Martin Cate's recommended technique: You'll need a 1-inch square of white bread, left out to dry overnight. Soak the bread in lemon extract, then place it in a hollowed-out lime hull. Float the lime hull in the punch and use a long match or lighter to set it on fire. This will create a dramatic tall yellow flame. Just be sure to have a pitcher of water and tongs on hand! If the bread starts to blacken and smell like toast, grab it with the tongs and dunk it in the water to extinguish the flame.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have a large bowl of ice water nearby. Cut a small X on the bottom of each tomato. Ease the tomatoes into the pot and boil for about 15 seconds, then promptly move them to the waiting ice water. (Continue with the remaining tomatoes.) Pull off the skin with the tip of a paring knife. If the skin sticks, try a vegetable peeler using a gentle sawing motion. Cut the tomatoes in half and use your finger to flick out the seeds.2. In a wide pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat until quite hot. Add the fresh and canned tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and season lightly with the salt and pepper. (I always start with a light hand with the salt and pepper because as the tomatoes reduce, the salt will become concentrated.) Let the tomatoes cook for a few minutes to soften. Then, using a potato masher, chop the tomatoes finely. Cook the tomatoes for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tomatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened. (You can make the sauce, which yields about 2-3 cups, ahead of time. Refrigerate it for up to two days or freeze it for longer storage.)3. While the tomatoes are cooking, make the basil-garlic oil. Heat a small saucepan over low heat with 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic cloves, basil leaves and pepper flakes. Keep the heat on low to allow the ingredients to warm slowly and release their flavors. When the garlic is lightly browned, turn heat off and let cool for 10 minutes. The longer you let the oil sit, the more infused the oil. Strain the oil, discarding the solids.4.

To make the filling, combine the ingredients for the ground pork together. Marinate at least 10 minutes. In the meantime, shred the cabbage and the carrots using your food processor or by hand. Slice the mushrooms into very thin strips (or you could use your food processer and pulse a few times to get a fine dice.2. Heat a wok or large saute pan over high heat. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat. Add the pork and stir-fry until no longer pink, about 2-3 minutes. Turn heat to medium-low, push the meat to one side of the pan. Add the garlic, cabbage, carrots, ginger and the mushrooms and stir-fry for 1 minute, until the vegetables are softened. Add the rice wine, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and black pepper. Continue to stir-fry for another minute. Scoop out the filling to a baking sheet and spread out to cool. Prop up one end of the baking sheet so that it tilts and will allow all the moisture to drain to one end. Let cool for 15 minutes.3. Discard all of the accumulated juices. Use paper towels to blot the filling to rid of extra oil or juice. Now, you're ready to wrap (see photos for instructions on how to wrap). IMPORTANT: Only use 1 heaping tablespoon of filling for each egg roll. These are slender egg rolls, the width of the egg roll should only be 1.25\" diameter.Keep the rolled egg rolls in neat, single layer and covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying. If you want to stack the egg rolls, make sure you have layer of parchment paper in between the layers to prevent sticking. Keep wrappers also covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Refrigerate up to 4 hours until ready to fry or freeze.4. To fry the egg rolls, fill a wok or pot with 2 inches of high-heat cooking oil. Heat the oil to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) or until a cube of bread will fry to golden brown within 10 seconds.

Bring the ends up towards the center and seal by crimping the foil shut. Repeat the process three times to end up with a total of four packets. Roast the potatoesHeat your grill to high (550\u00b0F) and close the lid. Wait at least 15 minutes before lowering the heat to medium-high (450\u00b0F) and continuing.Place the potato packets on the grill shelf and close the lid. Allow the potatoes to roast for 40 minutes, or until tender. I test this by skewering the tip of a thin knife through the foil and into a potato. If I don\u2019t meet resistance, the potatoes are ready. If you do not have a grill shelf, lower the heat to medium and place the packets directly on the grates. Char the potatoesIncrease the grill heat to high (550\u00b0F). Place the packets directly on the grates, close the lid, and allow to cook for 15 minutes to char the bottom of the potatoes. Remove the packets from the grill and set aside to cool. ServeOpen the packets, being careful not to burn yourself with the steam, and transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl. You may need to peel off some of the potatoes that have become stuck and charred to the foil. (If the potatoes have not developed a charred crust, close the foil packet and return to the grill until a crust develops.) Traditionally, this dish is served with the sauce already drizzled over the potatoes. However, you may want to serve the sauce on the side, allowing your guests to serve themselves.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/roasted-potatoes-with-huancaina-sauce-492382", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 95, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sweet-potato-bisque-327779.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 25, "id": 327779, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Sweet Potato Bisque", "preparationMinutes": 15, "pricePerServing": 155.39, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 1/4 cups apple cider", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "apple cider", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.25, "id": 1009016, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "2 tablespoons butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "1 chipotle pepper, canned in adobo sauce", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned chipotle pepper", "metaInformation": ["canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11632, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 cups chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 4.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "3 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "cloves", "unitShort": "cloves", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": "cloves"}, {"originalString": "1/2 -inch knob ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["peeled", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "inches", "unitShort": "inch", "amount": 0.5, "id": 11216, "unit": "inch"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup heavy whipping cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy whipping cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "kosher salt", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1082047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "Sour cream, for serving, optional", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour", "for serving, optional"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 6.0, "id": 1056, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 2 pounds)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["sweet", "large", "cubed", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11507, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "1 Vidalia onion, finely chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "vidalia onion", "metaInformation": ["finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11294, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 45.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/sweet-potato-bisque-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 14, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Add the butter to a large soup pot over medium-high heat.
