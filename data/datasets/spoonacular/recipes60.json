Pour over the chicken and gently combine to coat the chicken. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 4 to 5 hours, stirring a couple times to incorporate.Use a tongs or large spoon to remove the chicken pieces from the slow cooker to a cutting board. With two forks, shred the chicken into bite size pieces. The chicken should be very tender.Transfer the liquid from the slow cooker into a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Return the shredded chicken to the warm slow cooker. Bring liquid in saucepan to a boil. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup of orange juice with the cornstarch, and then whisk the orange slurry into the boiling liquid. Cook until the liquid reduces a bit and thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining orange zest and then pour sauce over the chicken in the slow cooker, stirring to combine. Serve orange chicken over rice with sliced green onions, sesame seeds, fresh orange wedges for squeezing over the top, and fresh Asian slaw. A couple grindings of black pepper are lovely, too.for the fresh Asian slaw:In a medium bowl, whisk together rice wine vinegar, lime juice, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Add thinly sliced mix of vegetables and toss to combine. This can be made a day ahead of time, stored in the refrigerator, and is actually better when the flavors have a chance to mingle for at least a few hours before eating. I like the contrast of crunchy tangy vegetables in this slaw with the sweet and tender orange chicken.

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).2. Season the steaks with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, heavy, ovenproof cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sear the steaks until browned on both sides, then turn the steaks on the fatty edge, opposite the bone, and sear until browned. This searing and turning should take 6 or so minutes total. If the skillet seems crowded with both steaks, sear them in batches, draining the fat in between steaks.3. Transfer the skillet containing the steaks to the oven until the steaks register 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) in the center with an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare. This will take at least 20 minutes for a steak that\u2019s 2 to 2 1/2 inches and 30 minutes or more if your steak is thicker. [For medium, leave the steaks in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until they reach 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C).] Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let them rest for at least 10 minutes. 4. While the steaks rest, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the luscious pan juices from the skillet, then add the shallot and garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste starts to brown, about 1 minute. Add the Guinness and boil until the liquid is almost completely reduced to a syrup, about 2 minutes. Add the stock and Worcestershire sauce, then boil until the liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and whisk in the butter until it\u2019s incorporated into the sauce.5.

Add the cut up butter to the dry ingredients and cut it into the flour using a fork or a pastry blender/cutter until it is worked in and about the consistency of cornmeal. Add in about half of the buttermilk and gently stir in. Add just enough of the rest of the buttermilk until the dough starts to come together and is no longer crumbly. You may not need all of it. Lightly flour a clean work surface and place the dough on top. Flour your hands and sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough. Gently press the dough out into a 1/4 inch thick layer. Spread the cold blueberries over the dough and gently knead the dough folding it several times on top of itself to work in the blueberries and create layers. Gently pat the dough out to 1 inch thick and use a biscuit cutter or the top of a glass to cut out the biscuits. You can gently pat together any scraps to get more biscuits (but remember the more you work with the dough, the tougher the biscuits become!)Place the biscuits in a cast iron skillet or in a round baking dish, making sure they are touching. Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter. Bake for 10-14 minutes, until lightly browned on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes before pouring on the glaze. In a medium sized bowl combine the other 1/2 of the zest and the juice of 1 lemon. Whisk in enough of the powdered sugar to create a glaze. Make as thin or thick as desired.

Cajun seasoning, divided1/2 tsp. chopped garlic1/8 tsp. ground thyme1/8 tsp. salt1/8 tsp. black pepperTwo 4-oz. raw flounder filletsOptional: hot sauceDirections:Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place beans, bell pepper, onion, and celery in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.In a small bowl, combine tomato paste with 1/4 tsp. Cajun seasoning. Add garlic, thyme, salt, and black pepper, and mix thoroughly. Transfer seasoned tomato paste to the bean-veggie mixture, and stir to coat. Set aside.Lay a large piece of heavy-duty foil on a baking sheet and spray with nonstick spray. Scoop seasoned bean-veggie mixture into the center of the foil, and spread it out a bit. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1/4 tsp. Cajun seasoning on both sides of each fillet, and lay the fillets side by side on top of the bean-veggie mixture.Place another large piece of foil over the whole thing. Fold together and seal all four edges of the two foil pieces, forming a well-sealed packet.Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the fillets are cooked through and the veggies are tender. Cut packet to release steam before opening it entirely. (Careful -- steam will be hot.)Serve each fillet with half of the bean-veggie mixture. If you like, add a little hot sauce.

Serve with whipped cream and fresh berries, if youre feeling fancy.</p><p>See more: Cake, Chocolate, Everyday Cakes, Photo</p><p>Do more: Link | Bookmark</p><p>| Pin | Print</p><p>| Email</p><p>| 673 Comments</p>", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/everyday-chocolate-cake-665899", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 90, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/7-minute-frosting-289205.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 7, "id": 289205, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "7-Minute Frosting", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar or 1 tablespoon white corn syrup", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cream of tartar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 18373, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "2 egg whites", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "egg whites", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1124, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1/8 teaspoon salt", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "salt", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.125, "id": 2047, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 cups sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.5, "id": 19335, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "vanilla extract", "metaInformation": ["pure"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.5, "id": 2050, "unit": "teaspoons"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup water", "aisle": "Beverages", "name": "water", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 14412, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 1.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/7-minute-frosting-recipe.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "aggregateLikes": 42, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Place sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, salt, water, and egg whites in the top of a double boiler.

"aggregateLikes": 469, "instructions": "For the cupcake:Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line the pans with cupcake liners. Set aside.Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cardamom in a large bowl and set aside. Combine the buttermilk, applesauce, and vanilla in a medium bowl and set aside. Beat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer, set on medium speed, until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, until the mixture is smooth and light. Alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, blending well after each addition.Divide the batter among the cupcake liners (about 1/4 cup batter per cupcake) and bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean -- about 18-22 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pan for 7 minutes. Remove cupcakes and allow to cool completely on wire racks before frosting.For the frosting:Blend the cream cheese, butter, orange zest, and vanilla in a large bowl, using an electric mixer set at medium speed, until smooth. Add the sugar and continue to beat until light and creamy -- about 3 more minutes.Add the food coloring and gently stir until the color is uniform.

Place a 6-quart saucepan with a steamer basket and 1-inch of water in the bottom, over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.Remove the tips of the wings and discard or save for making stock. Using kitchen shears, or a knife, separate the wings at the joint. Place the wings into the steamer basket, cover, reduce the heat to medium and steam for 10 minutes. Remove the wings from the basket and carefully pat dry. Lay the wings out on a cooling rack set in a half sheet pan lined with paper towels and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Replace the paper towels with parchment paper. Roast on the middle rack of the oven for 20 minutes. Turn the wings over and cook another 20 minutes or until meat is cooked through and the skin is golden brown. While the chicken is roasting, melt the butter in a small bowl along with the garlic. Pour this along with hot sauce and salt into a bowl large enough to hold all of the chicken and stir to combine.Remove the wings from the oven and transfer to the bowl and toss with the sauce. Serve warm.

Grease a 12 cup muffin tin with cooking spray or butter.In a medium sauce pot, combine the maple syrup, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 12 tablespoons butter. Cook over medium heat until the butter is melted and the sauce bubbling, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.Divide the pecans evenly among the bottom of 12 muffin cups. Now pour about 1-2 tablespoons of the sticky sauce over the pecans (reserve any remaining sauce for serving). The sticky sauce should come about 1/3 of the way up the muffin cup.Add 6 tablespoons butter to saucepan. Allow the butter to brown lightly until it smells toasted, about 5 minutes. Stir often, butter will foam and then settle back down. Remove from the heat and let cool 10 minutes.In a bowl, combine 2/3 cup brown sugar with the cinnamon.Lightly flour a clean surface. Unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry with the folds going left to right. Brush the sheet with half of the brown butter and then evenly sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar. Repeat with the remaining sheet of puff pastry.Starting with the end nearest you, roll the pastry up tightly like you would a cinnamon roll, finishing the roll with the seam side down. Cut about a 1/2-inch off the ends of each roll and discard. Slice each roll in 6 equal pieces, each about 1 1/2 inches wide. This should make 12 rolls. Place each roll, spiral side up, in the prepared muffin cups (place the rolls snugly into the pecans/sticky sauce).Place the muffin pan on a cookie sheet with sides. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the sticky buns are golden to dark brown on top and firm to the touch. Allow to cool for 5 minutes only, invert the buns onto the parchment paper lined serving plate (ease the filling and pecans out onto the buns with a spoon). Rewarm the remaining sticky sauce and drizzle it over the buns.

Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, cut a deep hole in the center of each cupcake, using a melon baller or small pairing knife.While cupcakes are bakingIn a glass or stainless steel bowl place eggs, sugar and lemon juice and whisk to blend. Place bowl over simmering water. Cook, stirring constantly (to prevent it from curdling), until the mixture becomes thick like yogurt. This will take approximately 10 minutes.Remove from heat and immediately pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps. Cut the butter into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has melted. Add the lemon zest and let cool.The lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Cover immediately with plastic wrap. Place wrap directly on curd so a skin doesn't form and refrigerate until cold at least 30 minutes.

Stir quickly with a fork to mix the two together until there is no visible dry flour - it will be very clumpy. Wait 5 minutes then cover with plastic wrap and allow to cool to room temperature 1/2 - 1 hour.Butter a standard-sized loaf pan. Sift the bread flour, milk powder, sugar and salt onto a clean counter or work surface. Add the yeast and mix well. Make a well in the center and add the scalded flour. Add just enough lukewarm water to form a slightly sticky, very soft dough. (I used all the recommended water.)Knead for 8 - 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough also needs to be thrown onto the working surface once every few minutes between kneading to improve the dough structure. Pick it up to head high and throw it back down on the work surface twice in a row after every minute of kneading.Knead in butter until incorporated then form the dough into a round ball and set it in a large, greased bowl. Cover with plastic and let it rise in a warm place until double in size about 1 hour. (To test if the dough has risen properly you can poke the center of the dough - if the hole stays it is ready - if it springs back and closes let it rise longer.)Once doubled in size gently punch the dough down, knead briefly and form into a ball. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a long oval shape. Then roll the dough up from the short end like a Swiss roll.

Pulse the graham crackers, butter, sugar and vanilla in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Press evenly into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake until firm, about 15 minutes; let cool completely.Make the filling: Put the chocolate and 1/4 cup ice cream in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until the mixture is almost melted; whisk until smooth. Beat the remaining ice cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy but not melted, about 3 minutes; beat in the chocolate mixture. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, arrange the banana slices in the pie crust. Spread the dulce de leche over the bananas and freeze until cold, about 30 minutes. Scoop the ice cream over the bananas and dulce de leche and smooth with a rubber spatula. Freeze until very firm, 4 hours.Make the glaze: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate and corn syrup until melted and smooth. Let cool, whisking occasionally, until spreadable, about 15 minutes. Slowly pour the glaze over the ice cream; return to the freezer until set. Let the pie soften 10 minutes at room temperature before slicing.Photograph by Ryan Dausch                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine
