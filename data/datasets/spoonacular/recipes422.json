Simmer until pasta is finished cooking.Once pasta is cooked, drain well and pour into skillet. Top with cheese, cream, salt and pepper. Stir until cheese melts and noodles are coated in sauce. Serve immediately.Recipe Notes: A lot of people have told me that this recipe tends to be very salty because of the taco seasoning. I have found that the brand of taco seasoning does matter! On tv and at home, I tried this with McCormick low sodium taco seasoning and it was perfect.  So, try to look for that brand. If you can't find that, then don't salt your pasta water or add any additional salt at the end.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cheesy-taco-pasta-587169", "dishTypes": ["side dish",
