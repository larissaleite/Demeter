Kneading the dough takes a bit of time! Finally when the dough is ready, it becomes super soft and a little shiny too.Let dough rest for 20-30 minutes. After 30 minutes, roll out the dough with a rolling pin until extremely thin (you should be able to see the dark part of the cutting board faintly through the dough) and as circular as possible. Keep dusting with flour as you roll it out.When it's thin enough, sprinkle cornmeal on the cutting board and the dough (to help prevent it from sticking). Fold up the dough into a flat \"burrito\" before you begin slicing it with a sharp knife.Slice the dough with a sharp knife into 1/4 inch thick (or slightly less thick) slices.As you cut the fettuccine, be sure to ruffle it up with your hands a bit and add cornmeal as needed to keep it light and to prevent sticking (as it sits)Cook in salty, boiling water for just 3-4 minutes until al dente. Note: Wait to cook the pasta until the sauce is done. Finely mince all the vegetables and the garlic. Fry the veggies in 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add a little white wine to reduce, then add the tomato sauce (passata), whole olives, marjoram/oregano and salt.Simmer the sauce for 40 minutes. When the sauce is about 5 minutes from being done, cook your pasta. Drain your pasta (don't rinse it!) and mix the sauce with the pasta.Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese", "spoonacularSourceUrl":
