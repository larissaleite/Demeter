Remove from the oven but leave it on.Press 3 fresh blackberries into the center of each tart. Warm the jam and using a pastry brush, spread the warm jam over the fresh berries. Return to the oven for 2 additional minutes or until tester comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.Using a paring knife, run the blade between the crust and the pan to loosen the tarts from any sticky berry juices and let cool for 10 minutes..Using a thin, metal spatula carefully remove the tarts from the tart dishes or muffin cups and set them on a wire rack.
