Set aside to cool for 10 minutes before peeling off the skin.Next in a large soup pot, heat olive oil over medium heat; add in diced onion and garlic and saute for 6-8 minutes or until onion is translucent. Transfer mixture to a large blender (such as a Vitamix), adding in beans and half of the broth. Blend until smooth. Next add in roasted butternut squash and remaining broth, but make sure you DO NOT fill the maximum full line on your blender. (You may need to blend in small batches.) Blend mixture until smooth and thick, then transfer to large soup pot and place over medium-low heat. Stir in almond milk until the desired consistency is reached. Add salt and pepper to taste. Then stir in nutmeg and fresh sage, and allow soup to simmer for 10-15 minutes.

Set aside and let cool completely.In a small bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder. Set aside.In the bowl of your electric mixer, add sugar and eggs, beating on high until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add in vanilla extract and melted chocolate/butter, beating for another 1-2 minutes until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the whisk or beater attachment, then remove it and stir in the dry ingredients with a large spatula until thoroughly dispersed by just combined. Fold in remaining chocolate chips. Cover the cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours.Preheat oven to 350 F. Place parchment paper (or a silpat!) on an ungreased baking sheet. Wet your hands with water then begin to roll the dough into 1-inch balls, placing them about 2 inches apart. Do this quickly and if you are doing the cookies in batches, refrigerate the dough in between rounds. Sprinkle a bit of salt on top of each dough ball, then bake for 9-10 minutes. Remove, sprinkle a tiny bit of salt again, and let cool for at least 10 minutes on the baking sheet. The should be completely cool before removing them. Once removed, place on wax or parchment paper to cool completely.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/salted-dark-chocolate-truffle-cookies-509916", "dishTypes": ["dessert"],

Heat over medium-high heat until mixture boils. Add dry ingredients, all at once, and quickly stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the pot. This will happen quickly. Transfer dough to the waiting stand mixer.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Mix dough for one minute on medium-high speed. (This cools down the dough slightly so the eggs won\u2019t cook when you add them to the dough.) Add eggs, one at a time, mixing thoroughly between each addition. Do not add the next egg until the first egg is completely combined.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Turn off mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Turn mixer back on and mix dough for one minute. The p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux dough should be creamy and smooth.                                                                                                                            10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Fill pastry bag with dough. Pipe into equal mounds, about two tablespoons each. (You can pipe these bigger or smaller depending on your taste. Just try to make each mound about the same size.) Use wet fingertip to gently press down point of each mound.                                                                                                                            11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bake until golden brown and puffy, 18-20 minutes.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Cut the butter into several pieces and add it to the flour, With your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until you have very small pieces throughout. Add the cheese and scallion, and stir to distribute. Add the milk and stir to combine.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Flour your work surface lightly. Remove the dough from the bowl, put it on your floured surface, and pat it into a rough square about 9 inches across. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, pat it down again until it's about an inch thick, turn it 90\u00b0, and fold in thirds again.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Dust your work surface with flour again, if needed, and roll the dough to a thickness of 1/2 to 3/4 inches. Using a biscuit cutter or other similar tool, cut circles from the dough and place them on your prepared baking sheet.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Re-roll the scraps. You'll get a better rise out of the next batch of biscuits if you keep the dough oriented the same way instead of rolling it up or smashing it together. The folding in the previous steps has created horizontal layers that cause the biscuits to rise, just like the layers in pastry crust or puff pastry. So, when you combine the scraps, keep the horizontal layers horizontal as much as possible. Cut more biscuit from the rerolled biscuit dough. If you don't want to end up with even more scraps, consider cutting the second batch into squares instead of rounds.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Rather than rolling the scraps a third time, you can make a few hand-formed biscuits from whatever is left after the second batch is cut They won't be pretty, but they're fine as samples for the cook.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Brush the tops of the biscuits with milk or melted butter, if desired, and bake at 400\u00b0F until lightly browned, about 20 minutes", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bread-baking-cheddar-and-scallion-biscuits-203518", "dishTypes": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 18, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}]}
