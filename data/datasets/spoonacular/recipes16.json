Place the butter, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt in a small saucepan.  Heat it on low until the butter is melted.  Remove from the heat.  Add the beaten egg yolks to the pan and and return the pan to a low heat.  Whisk the mixture constantly. Once the curd begins to thicken and releases a few bubbles, remove it from the heat.  Press the mixture through a fine strainer into a bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic onto the top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate for at least an hour.  But it's best if you can let it refrigerate overnight. For madeleines: Beat the eggs and the sugar together until they are pale and frothy.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and lemon zest.  Mix the honey and the milk with the cooled butter and add it to the eggs. In 2 additions, fold in the flour mixture.  Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to begin baking, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter and flour 2 (12 shell) madeleine tins with softened butter. Use 2 soup spoons (Tablespoons) to scoop a spoonful of batter.  The batter is thick enough that you can almost form it into an oval shape on the spoon.  Place a heaping spoonful of batter into each tin.  Press a raspberry deep into the batter with the hole of the raspberry up.  Bake the madeleines for 5 minutes.  Turn the oven off and let them sit for 1 minute.  This helps the madeleines to get their signature peaks.  Then turn the oven back on to 325 degrees F.  Bake them for another 5 minutes.  Let them rest on a wire rack until they are cool enough to handle. Then simply use a piping bag with a small round tip to pipe about a teaspoon of the lemon curd into the raspberries.

Mix the butter with the cilantro, lime zest, jalapeno, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl until combined; set aside.Grill the corn, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a platter and smear with the cilantro butter. Squeeze the lime wedges on top.We husked the corn before grilling to give the kernels a charred flavor. If you want to leave the husks on, grill 3 to 4 more minutes.

Rub all over with salt and sprinkle some inside the cavity.                                                                            Put on a rack and roast upside down for 3 hours at 250\u00b0 F (200\u00b0 F convection). Drain the fat into a bowl, set the duck the right way up and increase the heat to 350\u00b0 F (325\u00b0 F convection) for 45 minutes longer, till nicely browned. Leave to stand for 15 minutes, loosely covered with foil.                                                                            Reduce the chicken stock with the tomato and herbs to a saucelike consistency, then strain into a clean pan. Simmer the olives in water for 2 minutes to temper the flavor, then strain and stir into the sauce.                                                                            Cut the duck into pieces and serve with the sauce.                                                Raynaudes Secret            Baked olives: it is a revelation how olives are transformed by heating, their flavor mellowed and softened. Next time you wish to serve olives with drinks, try baking them. Cut a square of foil and put in a small baking dish, pulling up the sides. Put rinsed olives in the middle with a splash of olive oil, half a dozen peppercorns, a halved clove of garlic, a few coriander seeds, a bay leaf and a strip of orange zest. Wrap in the foil to enclose the olives completely then bake at 350\u00b0 F (325\u00b0F convection) for 10 minutes or up to half an hour. Serve in the foil parcel.                                                            From A Table in the Tarn by Orlando Murrin.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray.For the crust: Place the pistachios, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor.

Press the mixture evenly over the bottom of the springform pan. Bake until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature.For the filling: Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the cream, vanilla and salt until just beginning to simmer around the edges. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, let sit for 2 minutes, and then whisk until smooth and shiny. Pour the chocolate filling over the crust and sprinkle with the chopped apricots.

"weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 315, "instructions": "Prepare Pasta Dough:Sift flour onto clean counter top or large cutting board. Using fingertips, create large well in center of flour, so that counter top is visible.Crack eggs into well, along with adding olive oil. Whisk eggs and olive together using fork.Using fork, slowly begin adding flour from sides of well into egg mixture, whisking as you go, until egg mixture is no longer runny.Using floured hands (or bench scraper), continue to incorporate flour into dough, just until you can squeeze the dough with your hand without it sticking. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until it is very smooth and elastic.Divide dough in half, flatten into a disk using your palm, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, and allow them to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.Prepare Filling:Rinse torn swiss chard in a colander until all grit has been removed--don't dry. Place rinsed swiss chard (along with whatever water is clinging to the leaves) in a large pot. Cover and bring to a light boil and along to steam until tender--5-6 minutes. Drain and allow to cool until it can be handled comfortably. Place the swiss chard in a clean kitchen towel or thick paper towels, and wring out any excess liquid. Chop finely. Set aside.Using a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the finely chopped shallots and allow to cook until soft and translucent--roughly 3-4 minutes.Add the proscuitto and continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, before adding the chopped swiss chard. Saute for an additional 3-4 minutes, before removing from heat and allow to cool until lukewarm.In separate bowl, stir together the ricotta, egg yolk, swiss chard mixture, nutmeg, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Place in a large piping bag fitted with a small round tip.Assemble Agnolotti:Once dough has rested, add more flour if necessary (flour will absorb during resting). Divide each dough ball in half again and roll (at largest-width setting) each using an electric or manual pasta machine.Fold into an envelope (bring side into center, repeat with other side\u2014open seams facing vertically into machine) and repeat at least five times until dough is very smooth and rolls evenly.Roll pasta dough to setting \"5\" on your pasta machine. Cut into 12\" sheets. Allow rolled dough to dry slightly at room temperature (hanging on a rack) until no longer tacky. Since you will need to assemble the agnolotti, avoid rolling too much pasta at once, as it may get too dry.Take one sheet at a time and place on a large clean counter top, dusted lightly with flour. Pipe a straight line (1/2\" in diameter), horizontally along the sheet of pasta. Brush the dough adjacent to the filling (on both sides) lightly with egg wash. Fold the pasta over the filling--removing any air bubbles. Press firmly to seal.Using a fluted wheel pasty cutter, cut the filled tube of pasta away from the rest of the sheet.Using your fingertips, press the pasta into equal-sized sections (roughly 1 inch wide), creating a firm seal between each piece.Using your finger, roll each piece away from your slightly and using the pastry cutter, quickly cut between the seals to form each agnolotti (do this step quickly, as it will help create a firm seal).Place the assembled agnolotti on a large baking sheet dusted lightly with coarse cornmeal or semolina.Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, until all agnolotti have been assembled. Pasta can be stored in the fridge overnight, cooked immediately, or frozen on the sheet tray until solid (before being transferred to a ziploc bag)Cook the agnolotti in boiling, salted water until al-dente.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/homemade-agnolotti-pasta-478459", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 4, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/smores-chewy-crispy-bars-798157.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 798157, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "S'mores Chewy Crispy Bars", "creditText": "My Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 tablespoons butter", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1001, "unit": "tablespoons"}, {"originalString": "6 cups rice cereal", "aisle": "Cereal", "name": "crisp rice cereal", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-crispy-cereal.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 6.0, "id": 8066, "unit": "cups"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs", "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "name": "graham cracker crumbs", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10018617, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "10 ounce marshmallows", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "marshmallows", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marshmallows-mini.png", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 10.0, "id": 19116, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1/2 cup semisweet chocolate minichips", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "semisweet chocolate minichips", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 10319903, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 5.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/smores-chewy-crispy-bars", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 5, "aggregateLikes": 219, "instructions": "Char marshmallows under broiler for 2 minutes; melt marshmallows and butter over medium-low heat.

Using a pastry brush, butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and coat with flour, tapping off excess.Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse. Add the butter and pulse until the dough just comes together. Press the shortbread mixture into the prepared pan and bake until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.For the cookie butter layer: In a 5-quart saucepan over moderately-low heat, combine the sweetened condensed milk, brown sugar, cookie butter and salt. Slowly bring the mixture to a boil, stirring continuously. Continue stirring over the heat until the mixture becomes thick and amber in color, about 15 minutes. Pour the mixture over the cooked shortbread and spread evenly using an offset spatula. Cool to room temperature.For the chocolate topping: In a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, melt the chocolate with the oil. Once the chocolate has melted, pour it over the cooled caramel layer. Cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes, and then put in the refrigerator to cool completely, allowing the chocolate to slightly harden but not too hard. Cut into 2-inch pieces. Garnish with flaky salt before serving.

Butter a 1-quart casserole dish and set aside.Make topping by combining all ingredients.  Mix well and set aside.Wash and drain spinach and place in a large non-stick pot over high heat.  Once spinach starts to wilt, lower heat and steam until all of the spinach is wilted, stirring frequently to make sure it doesn\u2019t stick to the sides.  This will take just a few minutes.  Do not overcook the spinach.  Remove spinach from the pot and drain in a colander.  Place the cooked spinach on a clean kitchen towel and press to remove the excess water (This may have to be done twice).  Place the spinach on a cutting board and rough chop it.  Cover with a towel and set aside.In a small saucepan, combine milk and heavy cream and 2 cloves smashed garlic.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Simmer a few minutes over very low heat and then cover and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse the garlic flavor.  Remove the smashed cloves.  If a little garlic remains, that\u2019s fine.Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, combine olive oil and 1 Tablespoon of butter and heat until the foaming subsides.  Add mushrooms, reduce heat and saut\u00e9 over medium heat.  Season with a little Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Cook until mushrooms are almost brown, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Add the sherry and cook until mushrooms are nicely browned and sherry has evaporated.  Set aside.Melt 2 Tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, reducing heat to low, until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Gradually add flour and salt, stirring constantly.  Cook a few minutes over medium-low heat, continue stirring, until roux is smooth.  Slowly add milk and cream mixture in a steady stream to the roux, whisking constantly.  The mixture will become quite thick.  Reduce heat to low and heat until mixture is smooth and very warm, still whisking constantly.  Do not let it come to a boil.  Add the grated cheese and combine until cheese is melted.Place the spinach and mushrooms in a medium bowl.  Add the cheese sauce, stirring frequently to coat the vegetables.  Taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper as desired.  Turn into the prepared casserole and sprinkle with Panko topping.Bake 25 to 30 minutes until mixture is hot and bubbly and topping is browned.

butter is fully integrated into the flour.Transfer the flour mixture to a mixing bowl.Add the rest of the flour, salt, and sugar and mix to combine.Mix the milk with melted butter.  The temperature of the mixture should be warm, but not too hot that you can't touch it.Add the milk and butter to the flour mixture and either knead using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for six minutes or knead by hand until you can form the dough into a smooth ball.  The dough will be VERY soft.  It is nothing like bread dough.  Don't worry, you haven't done anything wrong and you should not add more flour.Place the dough in a covered, lightly oiled bowl and let it sit in a warm place until doubled in size.  I turn my oven on to 170 F, wait for it to heat up, then turn the heat off and keep the bowl in there.Mix all ingredients until fully combined.When the bun dough is done rising, lightly flour a work surface, remove the dough from the bowl, and form it into a rectangle on the work surface.  It will still be much wetter than you would expect it to be.Preheat oven to 400 F.Spread the filling over the rectangle and roll the dough into a log.  It won't be super easy to roll, but don't stress.  The only reason you are doing this is to evenly distribute the cinnamon filling inside your cupcakes.Cut the log into 24 pieces.  I found that the easiest way to do this was to cut the log in half lengthwise and then cut each half into 12 pieces.Place each piece inside of a cupcake liner in a cupcake tin.

In a bowl mix the liquid ingredients and spices, so the buttermilk, eggs, paprika, hot sauce, salt and pepper and mix really well.

Dredge the chicken in flour one more time, then place the chicken on a plate, and repeat with all chicken pieces. So it's easy, flour, buttermilk, flour. If your flour gets too dirty just throw it out and start with some fresh flour.In a frying pan, heat it lots of oil, at least an inch. Make sure the oil is hot enough. Do not put too many pieces at once, leave enough room in between the chicken, because you don't want them to stick together. Also if you put too much chicken, the chicken might not cook all the way through. The first side will take longer to cook maybe about 7 min, and the second side will cook faster, 3 to 5 minutes, so be patient and let the chicken cook properly. Repeat with remaining chicken.After the chicken is fried, place them on paper towels to soak up some of the oil and sprinkle some salt over it.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/jos-buttermilk-fried-chicken-560060", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 45, "servings": 3, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Call Me PMC", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Extreme-Rice---Call-Me-PMc-481954.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 45, "id": 481954, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Extreme Rice / Call Me PMc", "preparationMinutes": 5, "creditText": "Call Me PMC", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 small can sliced mushrooms", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["small", "sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "can", "unitShort": "can", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11264, "unit": "can"}, {"originalString": "1 c chicken broth", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "chicken broth", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6194, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1 can French onion soup", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "condensed french onion soup", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-soup.png", "unitLong": "can", "unitShort": "can", "amount": 1.0, "id": 6354, "unit": "can"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp each garlic powder, salt and black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "garlic powder", "metaInformation": ["black"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.25, "id": 1022020, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 small jar pimentos", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "pimentos", "metaInformation": ["small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pimento.jpg", "unitLong": "jar", "unitShort": "jar", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11943, "unit": "jar"}, {"originalString": "1 c rice, uncooked", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "rice", "metaInformation": ["uncooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-uncooked.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 20444, "unit": "c"}, {"originalString": "1/3 c slivered almonds", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "slivered almonds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds-slivered.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 10012061, "unit": "c"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 47.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.callmepmc.com/2013/01/extreme-rice-call-me-pmc.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "aggregateLikes": 30, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

almond milk. Beat for 2 minutes until well combined, smooth and creamy. Make sure your coconut oil is slightly cool (but still melted) before you add the egg or it will end up cooking the egg.In a separate medium bowl, whisk together whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder and salt. Slowly add to wet ingredients, with the mixer on medium low speed. Mix until just combined. If dough is too dry, add in a teaspoon or two of almond milk (or any milk you prefer).Divide the dough in half. Place each dough ball between two sheets of parchment paper and roll out to 1/4\" or 1/8\" thickness to your liking. Place on a baking sheet and put in refrigerator for 1-2 hours.Once you're ready to bake your cookies (and after the dough has chilled), preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.Remove cookies from the fridge and use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut your cookies. Place cut cookies on the baking sheet and bake for 6-9 minutes or until edges are just slightly golden brown. Allow to cool on cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Repeat with remaining dough, rerolling dough as necessary. Makes about 12 medium sized cookies.Once cookies are completely cool, make the icing: Place freeze dried strawberries in a blender and blend until they become a powder. Transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in powdered sugar, honey and milk until thick and somewhat smooth. Use about 1 teaspoon of icing per cookie and decorate them however you wish!Cookies will keep well at room temperature for 4-5 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/whole-wheat-coconut-oil-sugar-cookies-with-natural-strawberry-icing-718302", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 87, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Simply Quinoa", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/three-alarm-vegetarian-quinoa-chili-620177.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 360, "id": 620177, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Three Alarm Vegetarian Quinoa Chili", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Simply Quinoa", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "2 bell peppers, seeded & chopped", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "bell peppers", "metaInformation": ["seeded", "chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yellow-bell-pepper.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 10211821, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 (15 oz) can organic black beans", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned black beans", "metaInformation": ["black", "organic", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 15.0, "id": 16018, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 (25 oz) can of organic kidney beans", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "canned kidney beans", "metaInformation": ["organic", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/kidney-beans.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 25.0, "id": 16034, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 (15 oz) can organic tomato sauce", "aisle": "Pasta and Rice", "name": "canned tomato sauce", "metaInformation": ["organic", "canned"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 15.0, "id": 11549, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon cayenne (more or less to taste)", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne", "metaInformation": ["to taste", "(more or less )"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 0.5, "id": 2031, "unit": "teaspoon"}, {"originalString": "1 -

Mix and marinate in the fridge while prepping your mushroom stuffing.Rinse and pat dry your mushrooms. Slice mushrooms and finely dice \u00bd onion. heat a large pan over medium heat, then add 2 Tbsp olive oil. Add in sliced mushrooms and diced onion. Cover and cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the liquid from the mushrooms to remain in the pan. Sprinkle with in 1 tsp salt, \u00bd tsp pepper and 2 Tbsp Flour and whisk everything together. Saute an additional 30 sec until mushrooms have a gravy-ish consistency.Place your marinated chicken thigh, top side down, on a clean surface. Spread out your chicken thigh and place a heaping Tbsp of mushroom filling into the center. Cover the mushrooms with the sides of your chicken thigh and place folded side down into a baking pan, keeping the mushrooms sealed in the chicken (The toothpicks aren't necessary). They don't fall apart.For this recipe I arranged them on 2 (11x9\") metal pans. Glass baking dishes work well too. Make sure you aren't crowding the pans (the thighs should barely be touching).
