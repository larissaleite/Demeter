Make sure to smooth out large chunks. Sweet potatoes can take a lot more mashing than their white cousins, but don't work them any more than you have to.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Stir the pur\u00e9ed sweet potato into the flour. Mix with your hands till just combined, then turn out onto your work surface. Dust some more flour over the top and fold the dough over on itself a few times till you get a relatively flat circle. Roll or flatten it out to about 3/4-inch thickness. Dough should be moist, but not stick readily to floured hands.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Cut doughnut shapes out of the dough. For the large circles, I use  that I got for a dollar a piece at an Indian grocery. (They double as great prep bowls.) For the holes, I use an apple corer. Set the doughnut shapes aside for a few minutes so the exteriors harden a bit. This produces a crispier crust.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Heat the oil in a deep fryer, Dutch oven, or wok (which uses the least oil) on medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, pull off a small knob of dough as a test and drop it in. It should bubble immediately, but not violently, and brown after a few minutes.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Fry the doughnuts three at a time, turning occasionally, for three to five minutes, letting them get a darker-than-golden crust. Doughnuts will continue to darken as they cool. Let them drain onto a few folds of paper towel on a cookie sheet.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            While the second batch is frying, whisk water into the powdered sugar a tablespoon at a time until a thick but spoonable paste forms. Transfer the glaze to a pie plate or frying pan. Dip the drained doughnuts in each side for a few seconds, then set aside to drain on a cooling rack. Continue glazing each cooled batch while frying the next.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            The glaze will set as the doughnuts cool.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add beaten egg and cheese and mix everything well. Remove half the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the chopped spinach. Knead the ingredients in each bowl lightly and on a floured board form into long cylinders. The gnocchi should have a light texture which is cohesive enough to remain whole while it is being boiled. If the mixture in either bowl is too wet, add the additional flour until the proper consistency is achieved. Conversely add milk if the dough is too dry, using only enough as needed to bring the dough together. Cut the long cylinders into pieces about 1-inch long and crimp with your fingertips into gnocchi dumplings which are roughly marquise-shaped.Bring a pot of water to boil for the gnocchi.For the sauce:Melt butter in a saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked gnocchi, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add milk and allow to thicken. Stir in tomato sauce and heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add cream cheese. Blend with an immersion blender. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly.Boil the gnocchi until al dente, drain, transfer to a serving dish, and spoon sauce over. Sprinkle with chives.                                                    2007, Robert Irvine, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

The oil should be 3 inches deep, and it should be so hot that it starts popping (about 350\u00b0F). A good rule of thumb: if you drop a pinch of flour into the oil and it fries up immediately, you\u2019re good to go.\u00a0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            While the oil is heating, combine the paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, Old Bay, cayenne pepper, celery seed, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Mix things around with your hands so everything is distributed evenly. Pour half of the mixture into a small bowl and set it aside.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Add the remaining half of the spice mix to flour to the large bowl and mix well.\u00a0                                                                                                                            8                                                                            When the oil is hot, pull a piece of chicken out of the marinade. Put it right into the dredging flour bowl and heap flour on top of it; flip it around until the chicken is completely coated. Do the same with each piece until there\u2019s no more space in the bowl.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Pick up a piece of chicken, give it a light shake (just enough to get rid of the really loose bits of flour), and use your hands or a pair of tongs to drop it into the fry pot. Do the same with the rest of the chicken pieces. (You will definitely need to fry your chicken in batches, unless you\u2019ve got some really big bowls and pots.)\u00a0                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Let the chicken fry for about 8 minutes, until it\u2019s golden brown. Pull the chicken pieces out of the fryer with tongs and put them on a rack set on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each piece of chicken with the seasoning mixture, using the tongs to turn the piece so it\u2019s coated on all sides.\u00a0                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Put the baking sheet in the oven. The chicken pieces should rest in the oven for at least 10 minutes, so that the cooking process finishes. Meanwhile, fry up the next batch of chicken.\u00a0                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Hold the fried chicken in the oven until all the pieces are fried and rested and you\u2019re ready to serve it up. Then pile the chicken on a big plate, put it in the center of the table with biscuits, collards, and slaw, and let everybody start grabbing pieces.

Whisk the egg yolks in a separate bowl and gradually whisk in about half of the warm spiced milk mixture, stirring constantly.5. Scrape the warmed yolks back in to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula.

heat. Bring to a simmer before reducing to a low heat. Add the flour and stir continuously, with a wooden spoon, until a smooth elastic dough forms that pulls away from sides of pan.Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the mustard and beat for 1 minute. The mixture will look like it's falling apart, but don't fret, it will come back together when you add the eggs. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat for 2 minutes, or until fully incorporated before adding the next egg. At the end you should have a relatively thick, but pipe-able dough. If the mixture is runny or sloppy keep beating.Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and season with salt. Fill a disposable piping bag (or a piping bag fitted with a 2cm nozzle) with the choux mixture and cut the disposable piping bag so that you have an opening of about 2cm. Pipe the mixture into the boiling water in 2 batches, and cook until the gnocchi float to the surface. Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. Place the gnocchi in the refrigerator for at least an hour, uncovered, to dry.For the mornay melt the butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat before adding the flour. Cook the flour and butter mixture, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the mixture starts to bubble. Gradually add the wine and whisk until smooth before gradually adding the milk. Whisk until smooth and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and add the cheese and nutmeg. Stir to combine and check for seasoning and adjust as necessary. If not using immediately cover with plastic wrap, with the plastic touching the surface of the sauce to prevent a skin forming.When ready to serve, place the mornay over a medium low heat to warm and place a large non stick frying pan over a high heat and add butter and oil and mushrooms and season. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes before adding the rosemary. Cook for 1 further minute and place the mushrooms in a bowl. Return the frying pan to a high heat and add the vegetable oil. The pan should be smoking hot before adding the gnocchi. Add the gnocchi and shake the pan to cook the gnocchi on all sides and prevent sticking.

Add onion, carrots and celery and saute until slightly tender, about 4 minutes, adding in garlic during last 30 seconds of sauteing. Add chicken broth, thyme, marjoram, sage, rosemary and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Increase heat to medium-high, add chicken and bring mixture to a boil. Cover pot with lid and allow mixture to boil 12 - 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (rotating chicken to opposite side once during cooking for thicker chicken breasts -  if they don't fully immerse in broth). Remove chicken and set aside on cutting board to cool 5 minutes then shred into small bite size pieces. Meanwhile reduce heat to low and add cooked rice. Add shredded chicken to soup.In a separate medium saucepan (I just rinsed and wiped out the rice pan), melt remaining 6 Tbsp butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook 1 1/2 minutes, whisking constantly. Then, while whisking vigorously, slowly pour milk into butter/flour mixture. Cook mixture, stirring constantly until it thickens. Add milk mixture to soup mixture in pot and cook about 5 minutes longer, or until soup is thickened (at this point, you can simmer the soup for a longer period of time if you want the rice to soften more, just cover with lid first and stir occasionally. You can also add what's left in the remaining can of chicken broth). Stir in heavy cream and lemon zest and serve warm.*I used Lundberg Wild Blend Rice which I recommend for this recipe if you can find it.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/creamy-chicken-and-wild-rice-soup-543789", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 5, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/shiitake-mushrooms-with-baby-bok-choy-820841.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 5, "id": 820841, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Shiitake Mushrooms with Baby Bok Choy", "preparationMinutes": 15, "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "\u00be lb of baby bok choy, cut in half & rinse clean and pat dry.", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "baby bok choy", "metaInformation": ["cut in half & rinse clean and pat dry."], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bok-choy.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.75, "id": 93636, "unit": "lb"}, {"originalString": "5-6 Rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps sliced.", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "shiitake mushrooms", "metaInformation": ["sliced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shiitake-mushrooms.jpg", "unitLong": "slices", "unitShort": "slices", "amount": 5.0, "id": 11238, "unit": "slices"}, {"originalString": "3 garlic clove, minced finely", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic clove", "metaInformation": ["minced", "finely"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 tsp ginger, grated", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "ginger", "metaInformation": ["grated"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11216, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped & seeds removed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red chilli", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "red", "seeds removed", "finely chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-chili.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11819, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 \u00bd tbsp coconut oil", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "coconut oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.5, "id": 4047, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp sesame oil", "aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "name": "sesame oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "amount": 1.0, "id": 4058, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "Sea salt to taste", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sea salt", "metaInformation": ["to taste"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1012047, "unit": "serving"}, {"originalString": "Sesame seeds", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "sesame seeds", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-seeds.jpg", "unitLong": "serving", "unitShort": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12023, "unit": "serving"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 71.0, "sourceUrl": "http://iheartumami.com/shiitake-mushrooms-baby-bok-choy/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "aggregateLikes": 12, "instructions": "Slice baby bok choy into half.

Add in vanilla and beat to combine.Add flour mixture all at once and beat just until combined and dough starts to come together.Turn out dough onto a clean surface and divide into two parts. Form into rectangles about 1/2\" thick, wrap in plastic, and chill in refrigerator for at least 3 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with silicone baking mats.Roll out one block of dough to 1/4\" thick. Cut out 2 1/2\" round cookies with a cookie cutter, or use whichever size you like. If the dough is sticking, re-chill in refrigerator before moving cookies to baking sheets. They bake better when cold.Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, rotating halfway through, until cookies are golden brown and just set at the center. Be careful if you do a complex shape like a star, the ends can burn first, so watch them carefully.  Cool on wire racks.Place chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat cream to boiling on the stove.Pour cream over chocolate and let sit for a minute. Stir to combine cream into chocolate. Place ganache in refrigerator to chill while you are making the marshmallow cream.Combine the sugar, egg whites, and salt in a medium metal bowl and place over a pan of simmering water.Whisk the sugar mixture constantly over heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture looks smooth and shiny, about 3 minutes.Remove mixture from heat and pour into a stand mixer bowl. Whisk on medium speed for about 5 minutes until the mixture has cooled.Beat on high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, about another 5 to 10 minutes.

Add 1/2 cup onion; cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic and continue cooking until the onion is translucent and soft, about 2 minutes more. Stir in chile powder. Add broth, water, oregano and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 20 minutes. (The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.)To prepare enchiladas: Preheat oven to 400F. Coat a 7-by-11-inch (or similar-size 2-quart) baking dish with cooking spray.Combine beans and yogurt in a small bowl.Spread about 1/4 cup of the sauce in the baking dish. Arrange 4 tortillas in the dish, overlapping them to cover the bottom. Top with half the bean mixture, using the back of a spoon to spread it thin. Scatter 2/3 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons onion on top of the beans. Top with one-third of the remaining sauce, 4 tortillas, the remaining bean mixture, 2/3 cup cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons onion.

Stir to dissolve and let sit for five minutes or until the surface is covered with foam.In a large bowl combine 2 cups of the flour and the salt. Stir to combine. Add the frothy yeast water and stir well until everything is evenly mixed. Continue adding flour  cup at a time until it is too hard to stir by hand (about one cup later). Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and continue adding flour a little bit at a time and knead in until you have reached 3.5 to 4 cups total (depending on the humidity). You can stop adding flour when it becomes fairly stiff but still pliable enough to knead. Knead the dough for 8 minutes total.After kneading, flatten the dough slightly and add the cinnamon and raisins down the center. Fold the dough over and knead a few more times until the raisins are even throughout the dough and the cinnamon has given the dough a swirly appearance. The raisins and cinnamon may break out of the dough while you knead it in but just keep going and let the dough pick it back up as you knead.Form the dough into a ball, loosely cover and let it rise until double (about 45 min.). Punch the down down, form it into a log and cut it into 10 pieces (for medium bagels). Form each piece into a ball by pulling the dough back and under itself. When you have a smooth ball, pinch it in the center to make the hole then carefully stretch the hole until it is a couple inches across. Make the hole about 3x larger than you think it should be because the dough will puff up quite a bit during cooking and close the hole off. Form the rest of the bagels in the same manner.Place the formed bagels on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and cornmeal or non-stick spray. Let rise until double in size (about 45 minutes). Preheat your broiler near the end of the rise time.Put a large pot of water on to boil. While you wait for it to boil, place the tray of bagels under the broiler for one minute. Pull the bagels out, carefully turn them over then place them back in to broil on the second side. Every oven is different so watch the bagels closely. You do not want them to brown just turn slightly dull on the surface.Once the bagels have broiled on both sides, turn the oven to 375 to preheat. When the water has come to a full, rolling boil, drop the bagels in a few at a time. Boil the bagels for one minute, flip them over and boil for another minute on the opposite side. I found that a long chopstick works well for flipping them in the boiling water.As the bagels come out of the water, let them drain on a wire cooling rack so the bottoms dont get soggy.

In a small saucepan heat milk and butter until 120 F. The butter should just be completely melted. Gradually add the liquid to the flour mixture and beat on medium speed for 1 minute.</p><p>Add eggs and beat the mixture for 3 minutes on medium speed. Add the remaining 2 cups of all purpose flour and mix until incorporated. Then 1/2 cup at a time add enough of the remaining bread flour to make a soft dough. Knead on low (2) for 4 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Grease a large glass or plastic bowl with shorteningform the dough into a ball, cover with a clothand allow to rise for 1 hour.</p><p>To make the filling combine the sugar and cornstarch in a heavy bottom saucepan. Add the water and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Over medium-medium high heat stir the mixture with a whisk until it is thick and transparent. Remove from the burner. Add the jello powder, stir and return to the burner. Allow to bubble for a full minute. Then remove the pan from the stove, and turn off the burner. Add the lemon juice. Stir. Then add the berries. If you use frozen the filling will be ready to use immediately. If using fresh berries allow the filling to cool completely before use.</p><p>Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll 1 of the dough pieces into a 12\" square. Spread about 1/2 of the filling over half of the dough, leaving a 1/2\" border around it's perimeter. Fold the top half of the square down over the filling and press the edges to seal. Using a pizza cutter, cut into 1\" strips. Twist the strips and place on a baking sheet that is sprayed with non-stick cooking spray or lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Cover and let the twists rise until double. About an hour. Meanwhile Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack.</p><p>To make the frosting. Combine the powdered sugar and extracts. Add 1 Tbsp of the milk and stir. Add more milk a tsp at a time until you reach your desired consistency. After the twists have cooled about 15 minutes.

"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a large bowl, mix together the oregano, thyme and cumin with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Add the chickpeas and then the olive oil, and toss until the chickpeas are evenly coated with the spice mixture. Spread the chickpeas out onto the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.Add the parsley leaves to the bowl where the chickpeas were tossed. Gently stir the parsley leaves so they are coated with the leftover oil and spices and set aside.While the chickpeas are cooking, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, garlic and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve.Remove the baking sheet from the oven, sprinkle the parsley leaves on top of the chickpeas and cook for another 10 minutes. (Try to avoid the parsley touching the parchment paper, as it is more likely to burn this way.)To serve: On a large platter, put down a layer of the chopped lettuce and top with the tomatoes and cucumbers.  Scatter the crispy chickpeas over the top of the salad.  Drizzle the yogurt and tahini dressing over top of the chickpeas, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve with hot sauce on the side if desired.                                                            Be careful when removing the chickpeas from the oven, as they have a tendency to pop. Allow to the chickpeas to cool slightly before moving them around on the baking sheet in order to prevent this from happening.

In a small saucepan, add condensed milk, whole milk and heavy cream. (No powdered sugar yet!) Bring to a simmer and cook until it thickens and reduces, about 10 minutes. Make sure to stir so that the bottom doesn't burn and it doesn't overflow. Place sauce into the fridge to cool.2. To make the donuts, preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sugar and egg. Add in flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, oil, milk and vanilla. Mix until no lumps remain.3. Grease your donut hole pan/mini donut pan/mini muffin pan. Pour batter into donut ball pan, filling up one side only. Secure top side and place into the oven. If you are making mini donuts or mini muffins, fill about 2/3 full. Bake about 11-12 minutes until golden brown. Let donuts cool about 15-20 minutes before removing. They are easier to remove after they cool.4. Remove glaze from fridge. Reserve 1 cup and set aside for the frosting. Take remaining sauceand pour into a bowl. Take the most porous side of each of your finished donuts and poke numerous holes (at least a dozen) using a toothpick or fork. If you have a marinade injector, you can skip this step and directly inject the sauce into the donut holes, doing so a few times in a few different places.5. If you don't have an injector, place a few donut holes directly into your sauce bowl and spoon sauce on top a few times so that the sauce soaks into the donuts. Repeat with remaining donuts.6. In a small bowl, add remaining 1 cup sauce. Gradually mix in powdered sugar until glaze thickens. I used about 3 cups.
