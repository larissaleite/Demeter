Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon bake mats.Combine the flour, baking powder, spices and salt in a bowl and whisk to combine, set aside.Combine the sour cream and milk together in a small bowlIn a bowl of a stand mixer or using a hand mixer, cream the butter until light and fluffy, add in the brown sugar and molasses and mix again until creamy, 2-3 minutes. Add in the egg and vanilla and mix until combined. Add in the flour mixture alternating with the sour cream mixture in 5 additions beginning and ending with flour. Mix until no flour streaks are combined.Using a small cookie scoop or spoons, scoop rounded tablespoon and a half amounts of batter onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 apart. Smooth out the tops with your finger tips so a dome doesnt form when baking. If the batter is sticky dip finger in water first then smooth out.Bake for 9-10 minutes until the cakes have risen and set. Cool on the pans for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before assembly.While the whoopie pies are cooling prepare the pears. Peel, quarter and core the pears.Take a medium saucepan and set it over piece of parchment paper and trace a circle. Cut out the circle and cut a slit in the middle, set aside. Combine the water, maple syrup, cinnamon sticks and vanilla beans. Bring to a simmer and add the pears. Place the parchment disk on top pressing down so its against the water. Simmer the pears for 15 min. Turn off the heat and let cool completely.Once cool remove the pears and cut in half and slice   thick. Set aside.Set a pan of water on the stove and bring to a simmer. In a bowl of a stand mixer combine the egg whites, salt and sugar. Set the mixer bowl over the simmering water, making sure the bowl isnt touching the water and whisk the mixture for 4 minutes or until it reaches 160 deg, if you have a candy thermometer to measure. The mixture will feel warm and slick to the touch, all the sugar dissolved, and it will be slightly foamy. Place the bowl back on the stand mixer and attach the whisk attachment. Slowly bring the speed up to high and whip for 7-10 minutes or until the bottom of the mixer bowl is cool to the touch and the meringue is thick and glossy. Lower the speed to medium and add in the butter one tablespoon at a time. Once all the butter is incorporated, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides then raise the speed to high and mix well until the buttercream is light and fluffy. Lower the speed to medium and add in the maple syrup one tablespoon at a time until desired flavor is reached.Pipe or spread about 2 tbsp of buttercream on the bottom of one whoopie pie half, top with a few pear slices and dab a little bit more buttercream and top with another whoopie pie half.

Stir just until combine. Pour half the cake mix in bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch pan and spread evenly.Prepare the streusel by combing all dry ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl: brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Add butter and microwave for 30-60 seconds until butter is melted. Stir melted butter into dry ingredients. Sprinkle half the streusel mixture over the bottom of the pan and gently swirl with a knife. Pour remaining cake batter on top and sprinkle with remaining streusel.Bake cake for 24-28 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, your cake is done. Remove from oven and allow cooling for 10 minutes.Prepare apple pie filling (recipe below)While the cake is still warm, take the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes all over the top of your cake. Allow to cool for another 20 minutes.Pour remaining jar of caramel sauce over the cake and top with apple pie filling (recipe listed below).Put your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer to help it get very cold. This is optional, but something I usually do.Beat heavy whipping cream on medium-high speed. Slowly added powdered sugar, increasing speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form. Spread over cooled cake.Sprinkle with toffee bits and drizzle with caramel if desired.Slice apples into small pieces and squeeze a lemon over top and stir to combine.Add brown sugar, flour, maple syrup and cinnamon over top of apples. Stir to mix ingredients.Heat apples on the stove over medium heat for 15-20 minutes until soft. Stir occasionally. You want the apples to be soft.

Make the Cake: Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan; set aside.2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.3. In a large measuring cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggnog, sour cream and vanilla extract.4. In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar with the orange zest. Using your fingers, work the zest into the sugar until all of the sugar is evenly moistened. Add the butter and cream together the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the eggnog mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. (The batter will be quite thick.) Using a rubber spatula, stir in the cranberries. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan and spread into an even layer.5. Make the Streusel: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, flour and cinnamon. Work the butter into the mixture using your fingertips or a pastry blender until it is completely incorporated, then stir in the chopped pecans. Sprinkle the streusel evenly over batter. 6. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, up to 24 hours. 7. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the pan from the refrigerator while the oven heats. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes.8. Make the Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and eggnog until smooth; drizzle over cake. Allow the glaze to set for about 15 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature. Leftover cake can be stored, covered, at room temperature for up to 4 days.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/overnight-cranberry-eggnog-coffee-cake-689182", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 70, "servings": 15, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Serious Eats", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Time-for-a-Drink--the-White-Manhattan-207015.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 207015, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Time for a Drink: the White Manhattan", "creditText": "Serious Eats", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3 dashes orange bitters", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "orange", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange.jpg", "unitLong": "dashes", "unitShort": "dashes", "amount": 3.0, "id": 9200, "unit": "dashes"}, {"originalString": "1/2 ounce blanc vermouth (Dolin preferred)", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "vermouth", "metaInformation": ["(Dolin preferred)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vermouth.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 0.5, "id": 14132, "unit": "ounce"}, {"originalString": "1 1/2 ounces white whiskey", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "whiskey", "metaInformation": ["white"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whiskey-bottle.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 1.5, "id": 14052, "unit": "ounces"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 0.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/time-for-a-drink-the-white-manhattan-whiskey-cocktail.html", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "aggregateLikes": 36, "instructions": "Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Combine ingredients in a mixing glass and fill with ice.

Add 8 cups water to the pot, along with the salt, peppercorns, garlic, bay leaf and onion. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and let the broth cook for 20 minutes. Let cool slightly.Pour the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the vegetables and bits of corn (a pot lined with cheesecloth works well too). The broth is now ready to use as a base for soups, stews and sauces. If not using immediately, transfer to glass jars and let cool completely. Store tightly covered in the fridge for up to 1week, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.Technique Tip: Break the ears in half before cutting off the kernels. The smaller size and flat edge where it's broken allows for a sturdier grip when holding the cob on a cutting board.

(8-inch) ring mold, preferably non-stickWarm the water and cream in a medium saucepan over low heat until it is about 100 degrees F. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the liquid. Sprinkle the sugar over the top and let sit without stirring, until foamy, about 5 minutes.Add the flour and mix with the paddle at medium speed to make a moist dough. Add the eggs, mixing until combined, 2 minutes. Increase speed to high and beat thoroughly for 2 minutes. Stop and scrape down the bowl; add the orange zest and salt. Gradually add the butter while mixing, then beat on high speed to make a stretchy, tacky batter, about 3 minutes.Generously butter and flour an 8-inch ring mold. Scoop batter into the mold and smooth over the top with a spatula. Cover loosely with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and set aside in a warm place until batter rises about 3/4 up the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.Bake the savarin until golden brown, and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool savarin in the pan until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Flip onto a rack to cool.Meanwhile make the syrup. Put the water and sugar in a medium sauce pan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds; add both vanilla seeds and pod to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and add wine and orange liqueur.Place savarin in a lipped serving platter and pour the warm syrup over the top. Turn the savarin over a few times until fully saturated with syrup. Cover and refrigerate for an hour. Spoon the syrup over the cake a couple times while it chills to fully soak the cake.When ready to serve if there is more than a pool of syrup on the platter, pour the excess into a bowl or pitcher and serve on the side. Spoon whipped cream into the middle of the savarin, and top with desired fruit. Serve.Cook's Note: Savarin and syrup can be made up to three days ahead. Soak savarin the day it is served. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to overnight, or freeze for 2 weeks. Defrost and bring to room temperature before soaking in the syrupCopyright 2007 Television Food Network, G.P.

Line a baking sheet with foil.Toss the chorizo with 1 tablespoon of the oil on the prepared baking sheet, and bake, turning the chorizo halfway through, until fully cooked, 25 to 30 minutes. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel off the casing without breaking up the sausage.Meanwhile, cut open the avocado, scoop out the flesh and add it to a food processor. Add the cilantro, sour cream, lime juice, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, and puree until very smooth. Transfer the avocado crema to a small bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.Place a tortilla on a work surface, and spread with 2 tablespoons of the refried beans, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle 1/4 of the Cheddar evenly on top, leaving the 1/2-inch border. Place a cooked chorizo link on the bottom edge of the tortilla, and roll up tightly. Skewer the outside edge with a toothpick to keep it closed. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, beans, Cheddar and chorizo.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the 4 tortilla rolls in the skillet. If they start browning too quickly, turn the heat down to medium-low. As one side becomes golden brown, turn the rolls a quarter turn. Repeat until the rolls are crisp and golden brown all over, about 5 minutes total.Transfer the rolls to a cutting board, and let cool for 30 seconds. Cut each into 6 even pieces with a serrated knife. Arrange the pieces, cut-side down, on a platter. Top each with a dollop of avocado crema and some pico de gallo.Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

You should have about 5 cups of carrots. Place 1/2 cup water, the butter, honey, 2 teaspoons of salt, and the ginger in a large saute pan and bring to a boil. Add the carrots, cover the pan, and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook for about 20 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated.  You may want to raise the heat for the last 5 minutes.Add the orange zest and orange juice to the pan, tossing with the carrots. Simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes, until the carrots are al dente (tender but still resistant when you bite) and the sauce glazes the carrots. Add the pepper and another teaspoon of salt, to taste.                                                            Cook's Note: This dish reheats beautifully. Undercook the carrots a bit and reheat them before serving.For a crowd, multiply the recipe and use a larger saute pan. The carrots may take a little longer to cook.                            2005, Barefoot Contessa at Home, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

Cover and refrigerate.                                                                                           For sauce, drain raspberries, reserving the juice in a small saucepan; set berries aside. Bring juice to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until reduced to 3/4 cup. In a blender, puree reserved raspberries; press through a sieve to remove seeds. In a bowl, combine pureed raspberries, raspberry juice, sugar and lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.                                                                                           To serve, spoon raspberry sauce onto dessert plates; top each with a cheesecake cup. Garnish with fresh berries and mint.                                        Yield: 12 servings.
