In a bowl, mix the potatoes, egg, and milk together until combined. Add the flour, season with salt and pepper, and mix until smooth. Heat 2 teaspoons oil on a non-stick griddle over medium heat; pour about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the warm griddle, gently spread it to a circle about 4\" wide, and cook, flipping once, until golden brown, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a small skillet over medium low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the red pepper and cook until softened, about 4 minutes more. Add the turkey, gravy, and corn and cook, stirring, until turkey is heated through. Season hash with salt and pepper, stir in the parsley, and keep warm over low heat. Heat the remaining teaspoon of oil on the griddle over medium-high heat. Crack the eggs onto the griddle and cook until desired doneness.  To serve, put a warm potato cake on each of 4 plates; top the cakes with a fried egg and divide the hash evenly among them.

Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. Scatter 2/3rds of onions, carrots, celery and thyme sprigs across bottom of pan. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack directly on top of vegetables.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pat turkey dry with paper towels and rub on all surfaces with 1 tablespoon oil. Season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper (if using a brined, salted, or Kosher turkey, omit salting step, see note above). Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on the breast bone to flatten the breasts slightly.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers 150\u00b0F, and the thighs register at least 165\u00b0F, about 80 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While turkey roasts, make the gravy. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, another 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Tent turkey with aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Carve turkey and serve with gravy", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/crisp-skinned-butterflied-roast-turkey-with-gravy-195186", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 120, "servings": 10, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Gal on a Mission", "cuisines": ["american"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Candied-Sweet-Potato-Casserole-620398.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 40, "id": 620398, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Candied Sweet Potato Casserole", "preparationMinutes": 15, "creditText": "Gal on a Mission", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 tablespoon bourbon", "aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "name": "bourbon", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bourbon.jpg", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10014037, "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup butter, melted", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "butter", "metaInformation": ["melted"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1001, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup dark brown sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "dark brown sugar", "metaInformation": ["dark"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 10019334, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "2 large eggs", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "eggs", "metaInformation": ["large"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 1123, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup mini marshmallows, or more if needed to completely cover the dish", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "marshmallows", "metaInformation": ["mini"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marshmallows-mini.png", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19116, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "\u00bd cup milk", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "milk", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.5, "id": 1077, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1 cup pecans, chopped", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "pecans", "metaInformation": ["chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 12142, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3 pounds sweet potatoes; peeled, diced and boiled in water until softened", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "sweet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["diced", "boiled", "softened", "peeled"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 3.0, "id": 11507, "unit": "pounds"}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 49.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.galonamission.com/candied-sweet-potato-casserole/", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 17, "aggregateLikes": 31, "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.In a large mixing bowl, mix together the softened sweet potatoes, dark brown sugar, milk, butter, and eggs with a handheld or a stand mixer on medium-speed.

Setup a double boiler by finding a heatproof bowl that sits on the rim of a pot, then add 1/2\" of water to the pot before covering it with the bowl. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water. Add the egg yolk and butter into the bowl and turn on the heat to medium. Whisk together until there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth. Add the lemon zest, marjoram and salt and then slowly add the boiling water while whisking constantly (it may be helpful to have someone pour the water for you). Continue whisking until the mixture is thick and creamy (about the consistency of thin gravy) or if you have an instant read thermometer it should read 160 degrees F (71 C). Do not overcook it or it will get lumpy. Use a towel or oven mitt to remove the bowl from the pot, then whisk in the lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasonings to taste. The Hollandaise Sauce needs to be used immediately or it will clump. If you need to hold it, you can periodically warm it in the double boiler while whisking to maintain a constant temperature between 150 and 160 degrees F. To assemble your Eggs Benedict, put the toasted English Muffins on plates, top with a slice of ham, top with a poached egg, then finish with a generous blanket of Hollandaise Sauce.

milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat immediately, cover, and let sit for one hour.2) Whisk together yolks in a bowl. Bring milk mixture back up to heat (not simmering, just hot). Once hot, whisk in about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture slowly into the yolks to temper them. THen whisk yolks back into milk mixture.3) Cook over low heat, scraping regularly and stirring with a heat-resistant spatula. Cook until the custard thickens enough to coat the spatula, about 5-6 minutes.4) In a separate bowl, add cream and set bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice (ice bath). Once custard is thick, strain into cream. Stir well to combine and cool, then stir in vanilla extract.5) Chill custard overnight or until thoroughly chilled. Then add to ice cream maker and churn according to instructions for your machine. Freeze ice cream until it's solid. I like to stir mine a few times while it is freezing solid to remove ice crystals.For cookies:1) Mix together dry ingredients (flours, salt, baking powder, baking soda). Set aside.2) Cream together butter and sugars. Then mix in one egg at a time, slowly. Once all the eggs are incorporated, stir in vanilla.3) Slowly stir in dry ingredients. Once dry ingredients are mixed in add chocolate chips and stir just until they are evenly distributed. Try not to overmix.4) At this point you can chill the dough for up to 2 days if you want. 5) To bake, scoop tablespoon sized balls onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. You should get about 48 cookies out of the batch. Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes until they are lightly browned, but still somewhat soft.6) Let cookies cool completely (preferably on a wire rack).Making the sandwiches:1) Once your cookies are made, transfer them to a large container and freeze them for about an hour.2) Scoop a few tablespoon of ice cream and sandwich it between two cookies. Eat immediately or transfer to a freezer safe dish and freeze for up to 2 months.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/ice-cream-sandies-537606", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false,

Remove the neck and giblets (be sure to check both the body and neck cavities) and reserve for later use if desired. Rinse the turkey in cool water and then place it in the 5-gallon bucket. Add the cold water and the ice cubes, then add the brine mixture. Stir to combine. Cover with the lid and then place in a cold place for up to 24 hours.When you're ready to roast your turkey, preheat the oven according to the directions on the roasting bag packaging. Soften 1/2 cup butter and mix it with 1 tablespoon fresh sage and set aside. Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse it in cool water, and place in the roasting pan. Use your hands to loosen the skin between over the breast. Spread handfuls of the sage butter between the breast and the skin, rubbing any excess over the outside of the skin.In a blender, combine 1/2 c. chicken broth, 2-3 cloves garlic, and 1/4 c. melted butter until completely smooth. Use the flavor injector to inject the mixture all over the turkey.Slip any remaining rosemary and thyme sprigs under the skin.Stuff the apple, onion, and celery into the cavity of the turkey. Insert the meat thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey breast and then place the turkey into the roasting bag and roast until the thermometer registers 165 according to the roasting bag directions.

                                   For the Panna Cotta: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread the coconut in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, stirring occasionally, until most of the shreds are dark golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Spread the almonds in an even layer on the baking sheet and toast until fragrant and beginning to color, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn off the heat. Place eight 4-ounce ramekins or small serving glasses in the fridge. (Chilling the cups helps the panna cotta set faster.)                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a medium saucepan, combine the coconut milk, cream, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of the toasted coconut (reserve the rest for garnish). Split the piece of vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds with the back of a knife directly into the pan. Add the pod and gently bring to a slight simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally (do not boil).                                                                                                                             3                                                                            While the cream is heating, pour the cold water into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the top. Let stand (don\u2019t stir) until the gelatin has absorbed the water, at least 5 minutes.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            When the cream has begun to simmer, remove it from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout. Use a spatula to gently press the coconut against the sieve to force out all the liquid. Discard the solids and vanilla bean pod (or rinse,  dry, and save the pod for another use). Add the softened gelatin and whisk until incorporated. (You shouldn\u2019t see any bits of solid gelatin.)                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Divide the mixture equally among the chilled cups (do not cover with plastic wrap) and refrigerate until set, least 3 hours. (It should have the texture of a soft pudding.) Serve with 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons chocolate sauce, a dollop of whoop and a sprinkling of toasted, chopped almonds.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            For the Chocolate Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the dark brown sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Stir in enough heavy cream, a little at a time, to make a paste, and then stir in the remainder. Add the corn syrup and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, making sure to whisk continuously. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook, whisking continuously, for another 3 to 4 minutes to help cook out the bitter flavor from the cocoa and thicken the sauce. The sauce will be very glossy and take on a very dark hue (almost black).                                                                                                                            7                                                                            To test if the sauce is thick enough, place a small dab of sauce on a clean plate and let stand for 1 minute. If the sauce spreads, keep simmering. You should be able to tip the plate without spilling the sauce.                                                                                                                             8                                                                            Once done, remove from heat and stir in the butter. Serve immediately over ice cream or let cool slightly before using. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. To reheat: Microwave at 50 percent power for about 30 seconds, or warm in a saucepan on low heat.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            For the Fresh Whoop: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until medium-soft peaks form. (Alternatively you can whip the cream with a handheld mixer or by hand with a whisk, though it\u2019ll take a longer.) If you want the peaks softer, whip less. If you want them sturdier, whip longer, but don\u2019t overwhip or the cream will curdle and eventually turn into butter!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/toasted-coconut-panna-cotta-with-aunti-shirleys-chocolate-sauce-205308", "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 210, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Gluten Free Recipe Box", "cuisines": ["mediterranean", "european", "italian"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Gluten-Free-Tiramisu-Cake-561943.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 561943, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Gluten Free Tiramisu Cake", "creditText": "Gluten Free Recipe Box", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "3/8 cup (6 Tbsp.)

Pour the white wine and reduce. Cook the rice, gradually adding the hot stock and stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.Meanwhile cook also the clams.

Use to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, and prick the base several times with a fork. Chill or freeze until very firm. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.Put the tart tin on a baking sheet then line the pastry case with overhanging baking parchment. Fill with baking beans, then bake for 15 mins, or until the sides of the pastry have set firm. Remove the beans and parchment, then bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry feels dry all over. Leave to cool.Strain the orange juice, then measure 250ml into a heavy-based saucepan. Add the cream and bring to the boil.  Strain again if necessary. Whisk the eggs and sugar in a bowl, then gradually whisk the hot cream into the mix. Wipe out the pan, return the custard to it and cook gently for about 10 mins over a low heat, whisking frequently until steaming and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
