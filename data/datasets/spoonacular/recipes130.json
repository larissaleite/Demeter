Pour two tablespoons olive oil into heavy-bottomed 12-inch stainless steel skillet. Turn heat high. When smoking, add onions. Cook, stirring often, until onions soften and start to blacken around edges, 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Transfer half of onions to medium-sized baking dish along with lime juice. Set fish on top of onions and season with salt and pepper. Place rest of onions on top of fish, and drizzle with two tablespoons of oil. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake until fish is cooked through (check after 25 minutes and return to oven in 5 minute increments as necessary).                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, add cilantro, white wine vinegar, and jalape\u00f1os to food processor. Process until purred, scraping down sides with rubber spatula as necessary. With motor running, drizzle in remaining four tablespoons oil. Puree until smooth.                                                                                                                               4                                                                            Place heaping tablespoons of cilantro sauce on a plate.

Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Stir it in to the cheese sauce and toss until thoroughly combined. You may need to adjust the consistency with a touch more cream depending on the age of the cheese. You want it to be very creamy, but not soupy. The macaroni should move fairly freely in the sauce. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Cover the pan and set aside in a warm place while you finish the pork belly.Cut pork belly into 12 appetizer-sized portions (or to desired portion quantity and size). Spray a 12-inch cast iron or nonstick skillet with cooking spray. When the pan is nearly smoking, sear several pieces of pork belly fat side down until nicely browned and quite crispy; about 2 minutes. Turn and quickly sear the other side until just colored. Do not crowd the skillet, work in batches. You may find it helpful to press the pork belly down with a bacon press, another skillet or even your hands. The more contact the fat has with the skillet, the better the sear. Move the seared pieces, fat side up, to a paper towel-lined plate while you finish the remaining pieces.To serve: For appetizer-sized portions place a \u00bd-cup scoop of macaroni, with plenty of the creamy sauce, into a small shallow bowl or rimmed plate. Top with a single piece of pork belly, fat side up. Season with a good grind of black pepper. Repeat with remaining portions; serve immediately.Like this:Like Loading...", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/pork-belly-macaroni-cheese-for-fbla-e-book-471766", "dishTypes": ["side dish", "lunch", "main course", "main dish", "dinner"], "vegetarian": false, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 300, "servings": 12, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "My Recipes", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Shrimp-and-Crab-Cerviche-290504.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "id": 290504, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Shrimp and Crab Cerviche", "pricePerServing": 1538.17, "creditText": "My Recipes", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1 bunch(es) cilantro diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "cilantro", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11165, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 pound(s) crab or imitation crab", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "imitation crab", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crabmeat.jpg", "unitLong": "pound", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 1.0, "id": 93735, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "1 jalapeno peppers", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "jalapeno peppers", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11979, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "6 limes, key lime are the best juiced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "limes", "metaInformation": ["juiced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 6.0, "id": 9159, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 small onion diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "onion", "metaInformation": ["diced", "small"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 11282, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "3/4 pound(s) shrimp cooked", "aisle": "Seafood", "name": "shrimp", "metaInformation": ["cooked"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "unitLong": "pounds", "unitShort": "lb", "amount": 0.75, "id": 15152, "unit": "pounds"}, {"originalString": "2 riped tomatoes, diced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "tomatoes", "metaInformation": ["diced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 2.0, "id": 11529, "unit": ""}], "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 94.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/shrimp-and-crab-cerviche-215665/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 18, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [], "step": "Cut shrimp and crab into bite sized pieces.", "number": 1, "ingredients": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg", "id": 15152, "name": "shrimp"}]}, {"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg", "id": 404783, "name": "bowl"}], "step": "Place in bowl and ad juice of limes (do not use metal bowl).
