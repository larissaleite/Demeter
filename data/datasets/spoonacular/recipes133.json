Place steak in freezer for 30 to 45 minutes; this makes it easier to slice the meat. Remove the meat from the freezer and slice very thinly. Heat griddle or grill pan over high heat. Brush steak slices with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 45 to 60 seconds per side.Place several slices of the meat on the bottom half of the roll, spoon some of the cheese sauce over the meat, and top with the mushrooms, onions, and peppers.                                                Provolone Sauce:                                        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk, and cook, whisking constantly until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the provolone and Parmesan until combined; season with the salt and pepper.                                                Sauteed Mushrooms:                                        Heat oil and butter in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are golden brown. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.                                                Caramelized  Onions:                                        Heat butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook slowly until golden brown and caramelized, stirring occasionally, approximately 30 to 40 minutes.                                                Sauteed Peppers:                                        Heat the oil in medium saute pan over high heat. Add the peppers and cook until soft.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Working in small batches, add the ribs to the boiling water and blanch for 1 minute, allowing the water to return to a boil between batches. As each batch is ready, using a slotted spoon or a spider, transfer the ribs to the ice bath to stop the cooking. When cool, scoop them out into a large bowl. Add more ice to the ice bath as needed to keep it ice-cold.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a small saut\u00e9 pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the black beans and garlic and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, until fragrant Transfer to a small bowl, add the soy sauce, wine, ginger, salt, cornstarch, sugar, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir to mix well. Pour the black bean mixture over the ribs and toss well to coat evenly. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 45 minutes.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Pour water into a wok or stockpot and set the steamer in the wok or on the rim of the stockpot. Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the steamer. Bring the water to a boil.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Meanwhile, place the ribs in a large rimmed plate that will fit in your steamer basket (a glass pie plate works well). When the water is boiling, place the plate in the steamer basket, cover, and steam for 25 to 30 minutes, until the ribs are cooked through.
