Keep warm over a low flame while preparing the risotto.Place a large straight sided skillet over medium heat. Add uncooked barley and toast until golden brown and fragrant, stirring occasionally, 2-3 minutes. Take care not to let barley burn. Remove barley from pan and return pan to medium heat. Add olive oil and butter. After butter has melted add shallots and saut for 60 seconds until they begin to soften. Add garlic and saut an additional 60 seconds. Add barley back to pan and stir into shallot mixture.Once barley is stirred in, add wine to the pan. Stirring occasionally, let barley cook, keeping it at a low simmer, for about 4-5 minutes or until the wine is almost absorbed. Add about 1 cup of the warm stock to the barley pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes or until the stock has been almost absorbed.

Add baking powder and salt to pretzel flour, mixing to incorporate, then add pretzel mixture to creamed ingredients. Mix on low to combine, scraping bowl often. Wrap dough and chill for about 30 minutes, until firm but not rock-hard (thaw slightly before using if it chills for longer),                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mash small chunks of the dough into the fluted edges of the tart pan, going all the way around, then add more and smooth it out to get a circle in the middle. You don't want the crust to be more than 1/2 inch at its thickest or less than 1/8 inch at its thinnest. Try for a nice right angle at the top. Once edge is neatly pressed in, fill the middle with the remaining dough and mash it flat. You also want a right angle at the bottom. It's more important to have neat edges than a perfectly flat bottom. Wrap and freeze shell.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Once shell is thoroughly frozen, place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Unwrap frozen shell and bake for 10 minutes, then turn and bake for about another 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Carefully remove from oven and allow to cool fully. Crust will be very soft and fragile while hot but will harden and crisp once cool. Don't worry about any cracks in the bottom; they will be patched in the next step.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For the Filling: Melt 2 ounces chocolate in a small metal bowl placed over a small saucepan of simmering water, or by microwaving in a microwave-safe bowl in increments of 30 seconds, stirring in between. Once chocolate is fully melted, pour into cooled shell and spread with a small offset spatula or small spoon until the bottom is fully coated and any cracks are patched. While chocolate is still wet, press in crushed pretzels. Refrigerate until chocolate is set.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place remaining chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not quite boiling. Pour over chocolate and butter and immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap and gently stir with a whisk until all chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth. Slowly pour into shell and carefully place in fridge to set, 1 to 2 hours.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While ganache sets, prepare caramel cream: Place sugar in a small saucepan and add water to moisten. Set over medium heat until sugar caramelizes and turns amber (color should be between honey and maple syrup), gently swirling the pan to ensure even caramelization and using a wet brush to wipe down sides of saucepan if any sugar crystals start to form. Remove from heat and slowly pour in 1/2 cup of cream. Caramel will seize and sputter so be careful. Place caramel over low heat and stir until melted, then pour into a small bowl and refrigerate until cold and you are ready to serve the tart.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Test your ganache for doneness every 15 minutes or so once it begins to set and is no longer liquid. Lightly press a fingertip onto the middle of the tart; if it gives at all keep waiting. It's ready when it's solid but slightly soft. If it gets completely hard, remove from refrigerator and allow to temper briefly at room temperature until slightly softened. Cut into 10 slices with a large chef's knife, starting by rocking through the outer crust and then leaning the blade straight down through the ganache and lower crust. Wipe knife clean with a hot moist towel in between slices. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When you are ready to serve, remove desired amount of tart slices from the refrigerator to temper and prepare the caramel cream. In a large bowl, whip 3/4 cup cream to stiff peaks. Fold in chilled caramel, salt to taste and re-whip back to stiff peaks.

seconds to allow the yeast to dissolve and activate. Dump the all-purpose flour, bread flour, sugar, and salt into the water. Carefully turn the mixer on to low speed and mix for about 10 seconds. (To prevent the flour from flying out of the bowl, turn the mixer on and off several times until the flour is mixed into the liquid, and then keep it on low speed.) When the dough is still shaggy looking, drizzle in the olive oil, aiming it along the side of the bowl to keep it from splashing and making a mess.With the mixer still on low speed, knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and supple. The dough should be somewhat sticky but still smooth and have an elastic, stretchy texture. (If it is much stiffer than this, mix 1 to 2 tablespoons water; if it is much looser than this, mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour.)Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cloth, and place in a draft-free, warm (78\u00b0 to 82\u00b0F is ideal) area for 2 to 3 hours. An area near the stove or in the oven with only the oven light on is good. The dough should rise until it is about double in bulk. (This is called proofing the dough.)Once the dough has risen, flour your hands and the work surface and turn the dough out onto the work surface. Press the dough into an 8-inch square and fold the top edge of the square down to the center of the dough. Fold the bottom of the square up to the center of the dough and press the seam firmly with your fingers. Now fold the right side of the square into the center and the left side into the center, and again press the seam firmly. Turn the dough over, seam-side down, and shape the dough with a tucking motion so that it is about 6 inches square. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, generously flour the top of the dough, and then cover the dough loosely but completely with a damp lint-free cloth or a piece of plastic wrap. Place in a warm area (78\u00b0 to 82\u00b0F) for another hour or so, or until the dough rises a bit and gets puffy and pillowy. (This is proofing, again.)Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F, and place a rack in the center of the oven. Sprinkle the baking sheet with the cornmeal and set aside.When the dough is ready, remove the cloth or plastic wrap. Using all ten fingers, press and poke and elongate the dough three or four times along its length so that you press and stretch it into an almost-square log that is about 10 inches long, 8 inches wide, and about 2 inches tall. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until completely golden brown on the top and bottom. Lift the loaf and make sure the underside is browned before pulling it out of the oven, or you will end up with a soggy loaf. Let cool on the pan on a wire rack for about 30 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then cut into slices 3/4 inch thick for sandwiches. The focaccia loaf will keep in a closed paper bag at room temperature for up to 3 days, or tightly wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. If using day-old bread kept at room temperature, I suggest toasting it in a toaster to refresh it. If using bread that has been previously frozen, thaw it at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours and then refresh it in a 300\u00b0F oven for about 5 minutes.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/flours-focaccia-586434", "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 300, "servings": 8, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Foodnetwork", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/peanut-butter-no-bake-cheesecake-750631.jpeg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "cookingMinutes": 0, "id": 750631, "veryPopular": true, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Peanut Butter No-Bake Cheesecake", "preparationMinutes": 200, "creditText": "Foodnetwork", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "Chocolate sprinkles, for garnish", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "chocolate sprinkles", "metaInformation": ["for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-sprinkles.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 10093645, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1 cup plus 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "confectioners' sugar", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 19336, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "8 ounces cream cheese, softened", "aisle": "Cheese", "name": "cream cheese", "metaInformation": ["softened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg", "unitLong": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "amount": 8.0, "id": 1017, "unit": "ounces"}, {"originalString": "1 9-inch prepared graham cracker crust", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "graham cracker crust", "metaInformation": ["prepared"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust-graham-cracker.jpg", "unitLong": "", "unitShort": "", "amount": 1.0, "id": 18942, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "1 cup heavy cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "heavy cream", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 1.0, "id": 1053, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "Peanut butter chips, for garnish", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "peanut butter chips", "metaInformation": ["for garnish"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter-or-butterscotch-chips.jpg", "unitLong": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "amount": 8.0, "id": 93762, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup roughly chopped roasted peanuts", "aisle": "Nuts", "name": "roasted peanuts", "metaInformation": ["roughly chopped"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanuts.png", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 16092, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, at room temperature", "aisle": "Nut butters, Jams, and Honey", "name": "smooth peanut butter", "metaInformation": ["at room temperature"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.75, "id": 16150, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/3 cup sour cream", "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "name": "sour cream", "metaInformation": ["sour"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "id": 1056, "unit": "cup"}, {"originalString": "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder", "aisle": "Baking", "name": "unsweetened cocoa powder", "metaInformation": ["unsweetened"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg", "unitLong": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "amount": 0.25, "id": 19165, "unit": "cup"}], "imageType": "jpeg", "spoonacularScore": 58.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/peanut-butter-no-bake-cheesecake-recipe.html", "glutenFree": false, "vegan": false, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 25, "aggregateLikes": 6920, "instructions": "Directions                                                        Blend the cream cheese, sour cream, peanut butter and 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar until smooth and creamy with a hand mixer.

In a large skillet with about 2 inch sides, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, stirring frequently until the sugar has dissolved.Add the Honeybells to the skillet of syrup and cook 12-15 minutes, until soft and cooked through. Make sure the Honeybells are covered with syrup as much as possible and flip them at least once during the cooking process. Pour cool Honeybells and syrup into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.Make the cupcakes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a muffin tin with paper liners. In a large bowl cream butter, sugar, vanilla bean, and zest together until light and fluffy. I did this by hand, but a hand or stand mixer would work as well. Add the eggs and mix until once again light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix to combine.In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture and the cream and Honeybell juice to the sugar mixture alternately, beginning and ending with the flour. I did 3 installments of flour, 1 of all cream, and one of a little cream and the juice. Mix until just combined.Using a regular sized ice cream scoop, scoop batter into prepared muffin tin, filling almost all the way to the top. Bake for about 25 minutes, rotating halfway through if necessary, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out with only a few moist crumbs. If you would like to brush them with the syrup from the Honeybells, this would be the time to do it. Cool completely in pan. Cupcakes can be made 1 day ahead of time.Make the frosting. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup over medium heat, stirring frequently until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once this happens, stop stirring, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, and allow the mixture to come to 240 degrees F on the thermometer. In the meantime, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high until foamy. Once foamy, add the cream of tartar and continue beating on medium-high until stiff peaks form. Be sure not to overwhip the egg whites or they will become dry.Once the eggs are whipped and the syrup is at 240, turn the eggs to medium-low, immediately remove the syrup from the heat, and begin slowly and steadily drizzling it into the eggs. If the syrup is ready before the eggs, it can be turned down or removed from the heat while the eggs finish, before being replaced on the heat to bring to temperature. If the eggs are ready before the syrup, stop mixing them until the syrup is almost ready. Turn them back to medium-high briefly before turning them back down and adding the syrup.Once the syrup has all been added, turn the mixer back to medium-high and beat the frosting (what is basically marshmallow cr\u00e8me and is delectable all by itself) for 10-13 minutes until the bottom of the bowl is barely warm or at room temperature. It is important for it to not be too warm or the next step will not work.Once cooled, add the butter a couple tablespoons at a time, allowing each addition to incorporate before adding another. Scrape down the bowl occasionally. Once all the butter is incorporated, add the vanilla and vanilla bean and mix to combine. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix briefly by hand to make sure there are no clumps of butter. If the frosting is a bit soupy (because it was too warm when the butter was added) stick it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes, beat it again with the stand mixer. It should come together.Assemble the cupcakes. Using an offset spatula, smooth a heaping helping of frosting on the cupcakes. Place a whole, half, or quarter candied Honeybell on top of the cupcakes. May be stored at room temperature for 1 day, in the refrigerator for 3 days, or frozen, wrapped in plastic and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months.

Remove the pan from the heat and add chocolate. Let the chocolate stand in hot cream 3 to 5 minutes to soften, then whisk chocolate together with the cream. Stir in liqueur and/or chopped nuts and transfer the fondue to a fondue pot or set the mixing bowl on a rack above a small lit candle. If fondue becomes too thick, stir in reserved cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, to desired consistency. Arrange your favorite dippables in piles on a platter along side chocolate fondue with fondue forks, bamboo skewers or seafood forks, as utensils, for dipping.

Line a 9-inch square pan with a piece of aluminum foil (about 17 inches long), leaving a 2-inch overhang on each side. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of the lined pan with cooking spray.Melt half the butter (4 tablespoons) in a medium bowl in the microwave, about 45 seconds. Set aside 1 cup of the cake mix, and add the remaining mix to the melted butter. Add the egg and 1 tablespoon water, and mix with a spatula until well blended. Let stand a few minutes until the mixture is no longer tacky to the touch. Pat the dough in an even layer in the pan. Bake until the edges are lightly set to the touch and the crust is lightly browned all over, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a medium bowl in the microwave, about 45 seconds. Add the reserved cake mix, oats and cinnamon, and mix with a fork until crumbly.Spread the apple butter over the cooled crust, spreading it to the edges. Scatter the crumb mixture over the apple butter. Return the pan to the oven and continue to bake until the crumbs are golden brown and firm, about 30 minutes more. Cool completely in the pan.Using the foil overhang, lift the bars out of the pan and peel the foil away from the edges.

Add minced onion and saute for a few minutes till it softens and begins to brown. Add the garlic and continue to saute for 2 minutes longer till fragrant.Add the lamb stew meat and saute for a few minutes, stirring and turning the meat periodically, till the meat is browned on all sides. Scrape up the brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pan as you cook. If you've chosen a fattier cut of lamb, you might find yourself with a lot of excess fat at the bottom of the pan. If you'd like, you can drain the fat from the meat through a mesh strainer at this point, then return any meat, onions and brown bits back to the pan before proceeding.Pour 1 quart chicken broth and 2 cups water into the pot and bring it to a simmer. Skim any foam that rises to the top and discard.Stir in the turmeric, smoked paprika, and cayenne. Add 1/4 tsp salt (if you're salt sensitive, you can omit this and simply salt to taste at the end of cooking). Reduce the stew to a low simmer. Cover the pot with a lid, vent it, and let it cook for 1 hour, stirring once or twice during cooking.Meanwhile, prepare your fava beans. You want beans that are medium-sized-- not too big or too small, averaging around 6-8 inches in length. The shells should feel slightly firm to the touch, not soft or rubbery. They should be bright to light green in color. A little discoloration on the shell is okay, but avoid beans that are heavily blemished or that have large patches of grey/black on them. Slice the bottom tip off of each bean.Then, hold the stem end, snap it off, and pull it downward to \"unzip\" the bean, removing the string(s). During this process, some beans may start to fall apart-- that's ok, they will fall apart in the stew anyway.Slice the beans into 2-3 inch pieces. Reserve.Alternatively, you can shell the beans completely and discard the shells.When the meat has cooked for 1 hour, open the pot. Stir in the fava beans and bring back to a simmer.Cover the pot again, vented, and cook for 15 more minutes. Uncover the pot and continue to simmer till the beans are tender. This could take anywhere from 15-30 more minutes depending on the age and freshness of the beans. As you cook, season the stew with salt and pepper to taste.When the beans are tender, mix together 1 tbsp cornstarch and 2 tbsp of cold water in a small bowl till smooth. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the stew and let it simmer for 2-3 more minutes till it thickens.Remove the stew from heat. Serve hot over freshly cooked couscous, rice or quinoa (for gluten free use rice or quinoa).

Season with salt or patis and black pepper. Add the bangus pieces.Seal the pressure cooker. Keep the heat on high until the valve starts to turn. Turn the heat to low and let the bangus cook for about an hour and a half. Note that the cooking time may vary depending on the size of the fish. If the fish are large, even if they are cut into portions, they will take longer to cook to the point that the bones, fins and scales are soft.Note also that once the valve starts to turn, it is very important to keep the heat very, very low so that the water is barely simmering. This will prevent the bangus from moving too much inside the pressure cooker \u2014 this is essential so that the bangus pieces retain their shape. If the water is boiling like crazy inside and the bangus pieces are taking somersaults for an hour and a half, they\u2019ll disintegrate before they\u2019re done.Meanwhile, peel the chayote and cut into small cubes.

Add the chayote cubes to the hot broth and simmer for about 15 minutes (no need to seal the pressure cooker; just cover with the lid).

Sprinkle half of the herb mixture evenly over tops of chicken. Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add chicken to skillet, herbed side down, then add remaining herb mixture to tops of chicken. Cook chicken until fully cooked through, about 8 - 12 minutes, occasionally rotating chicken (time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts. If chicken is browning too quickly reduce heat to medium low as needed). Transfer cooked chicken to a plate, let rest 5 minutes then dice into pieces.Meanwhile cook pasta according to directions listed on package, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.In a clean skillet (large and deep), melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly, add garlic and cook 30 seconds longer, stirring constantly. While whisking, slowly pour in milk then cream (whisk vigorously to break up clumps). Season with salt and pepper to taste (a fair amount of each) and bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Once it reaches a boil and thickens, reduce heat to medium-low, add Neufchatel and parmesan cheese and cook, stirring frequently, until cheeses have melted. Toss in cooked pasta, then add cooked chicken, steamed asparagus and bacon and toss to evenly coat. Add in reserved pasta water as desired (it will thicken as it rests and the pasta will absorb the liquids, so add up to 1/2 cup as needed). Serve immediately.
