Discardpotato skins. Process until smooth.  Measure 16 ounces (1 3/4 cups) of sweet potato puree into a small bowl. Set aside.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Prepare the crust. In a small bowl, combine cookie crumbs, granulated sugar, and butter. Stir with a fork to combine. Press mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Bake crust until golden brown.

In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and dark brown sugar. Cream until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time. Blend well between each addition. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Add sweet potato puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth. Filling will be thick. Spread filling evenly over prepared crust.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Bake cheesecake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Filling should be set and not jiggle. Remove pan from oven. Place on a wire rack to cool. Once cooled, cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight.
