# QUESTIONS:
# how many recipes are in each cluster?
# which features were more important when creating the clusters?
# which is the best value for k? between 5 and 15?
# how to draw the plot with the recipes in the different clusters?



# to see recipes in one specific cluster with much less recipes than the other, for example:

recipes_cluster_6 <- recipes[km$cluster == 6,]

# see if it is not outlier. if it is, remove:

# mongo

# use demeter

# db.recipe.remove({ "title" : "FISH CAKES TOPPED WITH CELERY RELISH & MAYONNAISE" } )

# cluster with 4 recipes -> more caloric ones, all dairy free and peanut free
